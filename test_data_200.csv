"ve been using this as a primer as well as for skin treatment. It leaves my complexion glowing and the texture of my face feels so, so smooth. My make up goes on very nicely without smudging. \n\nI see results after a few weeks of using the product. Laughter lines look thinner and have less depth. My skin can sometimes have slight patches of uneven skin town. I feel like it has helped even if out. Overall I^m really satisfied and would equate it to products at higher price points.\n\nReceived this complimentary from Influenster.",1
"This oil comes out  rich & lustrous, but provides a buildable luminous glow that makes any skin type or tone look great, especially in the sunlight. It goes on and feels like a rich body oil, but is not as ^^tacky^^ as other reviewers say. It smells great.",1
"I usually use a wax pencil to set my brows, so to speak but omg. I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review and I^m pretty sure I have a new favorite product. the small brush really lets me get in there and fill in those spots where I^m missing eyebrow. lol It works wonders and didn^t flake throughout the day. I^m definitely adding this as a staple to my collection.",1
The pencil is fine. Its good enough. But the brow gel is so good! It leaves a dimensional finish because it^s not a matte finish gel. It gives good enough hold for me and the pigmentation is just right. I wish the gel would come on its own.,1
"Exactly what I^ve been looking for. Gives a beautiful lit from within glow. It looks sparkly when you first drip it onto your fingers, but they really dissapear on the skin. Provides a tacky base for makeup, or you can apply moisturizer or powder on top and its smooth. Looks very glass like when the sun reflects, but somehow natural? idk its magic.",1
"This is magic, pure magic. I use this anytime of the day, but love using it at night over the Fresh lip serum; best combo for really dry lips. I had a sample size and I already repurchased the full size.",1
"It^s pretty but I dont think I^ll repurchase, not worth the price for the amount of product. I know I can find something similar for half the price but if you have the extra money I do recommend it. The color is flattering, although more shimmery in person. I don^t find the scent to be strong like others are saying.",1
This product is good but not amazing. Didn^t work wonders but made my pores look smaller. Did dry out my skin a bit. The consistency is a bit serum mixed with lotion? Weird but not intolerable! This was complimentary for my honest review.,1
"I love the idea of this product; I used to own a wonderful, similarly packaged Lancome powder bronzer years back. But the difference is, this brush is much harder to use. Unlike the Lancome product, there is no button to push small, measured amounts of powder into the brush hairs from the chamber so you can easily apply it on your skin in a targeted fashion. \n\nIt^s a bit messy as you have to clumsily tap the powder out on your arm repeatedly as you apply it. And once you apply it, too much comes out at once. So I have to spread the powder around with my fingers to get an even, invisible layer on my skin. This takes extra time when you^re in a hurry.\n\nIdeally, the packaging would be a bit more sophisticated. But I love the overall ease of use, the simple ingredients, and the multitasking abilities of this SPF setting powder. It does seem to last a few hours, it leaves a smooth, finished matte look over your makeup, and I definitely prefer it over a regular sunscreen for a quick outing. \n\nIt recommends that you reapply the powder every 2 hours, and although it^s very easy to toss it in a bag and go, it^s not quite as easy to apply it in public. The powder gets everywhere and looks clumpy on your face without your fingers and a mirror. I^d give this product a 3.5 because the packaging could be a lot better. But it^s not bad.",1
"I^ve tried different concealers over the years, but there^s nothing like the quality of this one. Brightens, stays in place, doesn^t crease, isn^t too thick. I keep trying new ones and keep going back to this.",1
"Buyer beware!! I used this product for a few months to clean my blenders. Recently had to take apart all of the plumbing under my sink and found a resolidified mass of foundation colored blender cleaner blocking the pipe past the P-Trap. No other objects causing blockage, just walls of pipe slimed by this cleanser congealing back into a solid.  BUY THE LIQUID, the solid doesnt even clean under the surface of the sponge well at all, and you^ll destroy the sponge trying to get it clean.",1
I love the texture of this vitamin c vs others I’ve tried in the past.  It is super silky and absorbs instantly. I can tell it has also helped with my pigmentation and skin texture as well. I will continue to purchase in the future.,0
Was recommended to this product after I needed a step up from my origins eye doctor...went to bed with purplish dry eyelids and peeling skin ..woke up with better eyes than my baseline...can^t wait to see what this does in the long term!,1
This product is so unique. It^s a balm but not greasy or hard to apply. It has no fragrance that I can detect. A nice smooth consistency that provides instant hydration and plumping of the eye area. It leaves no greasy residue and works perfect under make up. Helps with creasing and longevity of product. I typically don^t use a separate eye product but this one is too good and effective to leave out!,1
Got this as a free offer from sephora. So glad I didn^t spend money on this  and in fact I^m going to toss the rest of it in the trash. It is light and fluffy and natural looking BUT it smudges under and on top! so now im at work can^t touch my face cuz the covid and im just gunna look like a hot mess.,1
"This was a fun way for me to try different highlighters, but honestly I only felt comfortable using one or two out of the kit.  My fifteen-year-old daughter is thrilled with the ones I ^^handed down^^ to her though.",1
This has become my favorite night time mask. It has a great scent. The texture is thicker than a regular moisturizer but it absorbs into the skin very well. When you wash it off the following morning it leaves your skin feeling so soft. My skin has definitely become more radiant while using this product.,1
"I use to SWEAR by this mascara for years, it would out last rain, never clumped, lasted forever, never got any crumbling in my eyes !! I am not sure if they changed the formula but when I repurchased it within the last year it was HORRIBLE, it dried out within a few days of usage, it crumbled, it clumped, it did not out last rain any longer... and I thought it was a bad batch, so I bought it again, and again but each time it did not do what it use to, did they change it ???",1
"the best concealer I^ve used! I^ve tried a bunch of different concealers high and low end and have been using the NARS radiant creamy concealer for almost a year and this blew it out of the water.. wore it for 10+ hours in a greasy restaurant setting and only lightly touched up once and it still looked perfect with no caking around my nose at all, which is always the first to look gross. I^m so impressed. definitely full coverage as well. wish it was cheaper.",1
"I bought this palette because I was really hyped about the bold colours, since there^s almost no palettes this colourful on the market right now. I was so hyped, but it was so so disappointing when I tried to use it, specifically the mattes. I tried multiple looks, even trying different primers, concealer as primer, setting the primer or not setting it, but no matter what I tried the colour just wouldn^t hold down. they wouldn^t blend, and when trying to blend the colour would just lift which left weird spaces of discoloration in my crease.\nEven when I tried to pack down colour, it just wouldn^t stay. the colour seemed to fade within seconds, and it wouldn^t keep the pigment. Along with that, there was fallout. I usually don^t mind fallout, and since it wasn^t very much I didn^t think I would care, but when you try and sweep it away it just smudges. if you decide to buy this palette, make sure to do your eyes before your base because it thing my foundation and concealer every time I used it because of the fallout.\nAs for the shimmers, I actually liked them. some were a little clumpy and thick, especially Alexandra. Other than them being clumpy, they looked great on the eye. I read a review saying they transferred a lot, but for me they didn^t at all.\nthough the shimmers are pretty, the matter in this palette are horrid. honestly, save your money if you^re considering this palette.",1
I had a sample of the cleanser so I decided to buy the kit. I have combination skin that is very oily. This set is amazing. I helped to clear up the oil and my skin. I now have to buy the full size products. I love the tingling feeling from the peppermint oil. My skin feels cleaner than when I have tried other products.,1
"I bought this pallete on a whim,  I^d never tried anything VV before.   This pallete is glorious!  The pigment is gorgeous and it applies like silk and blends better than a kitchen aid mixer.      I loved how easily the colors melted into each other without losing their own vibe.   And so vibrant! Huge winner in my book.",1
"The first time I used this, I brushed it on just with the bristles. Great separation, great length. Then I started using it with the flat side first, rolling over the bristles. This gave it a thicker look. 2 for 1 mascara!",1
This deodorant actually makes me smell worse. It is like it enhances the smell of sweat. I am someone that doesn^t even sweat much at all and I just wanted something to wear around the house to smell nice. You would also have to constantly reapply this. I used to use a Lavanila deodrant that Sephora no longer carries. I highly recommend that deodorant.,0
Felt moisturizing for about 30 minutes then after it soaked in somehow my lips felt extremely dry.  I have put it in every night for a week and still the same.  My lips are not agreeing with this lip therapy.,1
"this is a good hydrating primer for dry skin, the reason I give it 4 stars is because it does give me bumps or little zits if I use it too often, if I use it only sometimes I am ok. I just have sensitive skin to coconut which I wasn^t aware of before purchasing this product. it does smell wonderful though but not overpowering. It also seems to blur my pores a little.",1
"If there is one thing you have to know, it is this: The only matte lipstick that doesnt dry out your lips! holy moly! Yes, its pricey, but listen up - I dont have a problem investing in a good lipstick if it^s worth it and this one is worth it! I own a lot (and I mean A LOT) of lipsticks and this is by far my favorite matte formula. The color (102) is stunning as well! Invest in yourself, girl!",1
I have used this tinted moisturizer for years and have loved it. I was excited when the spf went from 20 to 30. However the new version has an awful orange tint. I checked other reviews and yep-I’m not the only one noticing this. I am changing to another brand. So disappointed!,1
"I absolutely love this product. It gives the perfect glow or dewy look. I loved the original and this doesn^t disappoint, even having textured skin naturally this still makes my skin look beautiful.  \n\nReceived this for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.",1
"I LOVE this stuff! It gave me a really nice, natural looking tan. Keep in mind it isn^t instant so if you have something you want to look tan for then you should apply it the day/night before. The scent is really nice however it does wear off and  leaves you with that self tanner scent (the reason for 4 stars). It doesn^t transfer to anything either! I will definitely recommend this product and continue to purchase it!",1
"I am COMPLETLY OBSESSED with this new Precision Life Liner! When I tell you its thin, its THIN! Its long lasting, doesn^t crack, is very pigmented, and comes off ONLY when YOU want it to! I tried a fun look, and I can^t WAIT to try it on different types of looks. If you^re looking for a thin liner this is it!",1
"I love how innovative the packaging is. All of the components magnetize together and that is just a fun little added detail. However, I am not in love with the actual formula of any of the products. The Brow gel is just okay, and the mascaras are on par with what you could get at the drugstore. Nothing is bad quality, but it also didn^t impress me.",0
This checks all of the boxes for me. When I run out I turn to my travel size unit which is how I got hooked. It^s good to buy the sampler travel 1st to make sure-- then upgrade to the large. I wish it cost less- its hard to buy two at a time. I also really like that it is NOT tinted like so many other spf moisturizers which I despise.,1
"This will not be like a full review, due to I just received the foundation in the mail yesterday. My 4 stars are based on me trying it today and applying 1 pump. I love that it is not heavy, is lightweight, and has a sheerer consistency. I don^t like heavy foundations and this formula is a runny texture but looks like skin. You still look like yourself. In regards to my skin, I have no pimples, my texture of skin is great, I have a little darkening in the cheekbone area. I also have a little darkening under the eyes mostly due to allergy season here in Florida. I choose to watch videos etc and ordered online. Deep 33 was definitely a good color choice.",1
I live in Idaho and have really dry skin and this moisturizer is what I have been looking for for so long! not only to I love the more natural ingredients my skin just drink it up and it^s not too heavy and just perfectly hydrating. I never would have known about this moisturizer if it wasn^t for Influensters sending it to me complimentary. I^m so thankful!,1
I received this as a free sample in my last order. the finish is lovely and I like the way it looks on my skin however... it has a strong floral scent that was very off putting and if i have a feeling if I wore it all day I would feel sick . I don^t know why brands have products with strong scents like these,0
"Great primer if you have combo dry skin, if not it might be to heavy on the face. This is my first time buying/using primer as part of my makeup routine and it^s made a big difference in the longevity of my foundation",1
"I have hormonal acne that leaves dark scars behind.  I have tried facials, masks, vitamin c, too many products that have not improved anything! Seriously disappointing.  However my scars are lightening up and it’s visible changes I see in the mirror.  I have taken pictures also and compared them.  This is working for me so I will keep this on my shelf as my go to nightly.   I feel relieved to have something that is actually working and for me to not feel so self conscious about my skin.  I never experienced breakouts or acne as a teen.",1
"I am quite pale, and this works like a germ. I looked crazy at first (I^m not a pro at all lol) because it is really powdery and it^s easy to put too much on the brush, even is you try to remove the excess. I^ve learn how to work with it and it looks so nice! blends like a charm and I mean I^ll have this forever its huge! the color is perfect for my skin tone too.",1
"Was hesitant to order online but was very glad I ordered Bamboo\nTruly matches my skin perfectly!\nUsually end up mixing shades to get the right color. It doesn^t sink into my almost 70 yr old ^^expression lines^^ aka wrinkles, does help to diminish their appearance. Lid stays on making it easy to touch up away from home. Have purchased twice & will buy again. For reference, light to fair complexion, white blonde hair. Has a creamy consistency when applied, easy to blend out. Coverage can be built up but I use it sparingly, not a full coverage user. \nGoes on smoothly and stays. Do recommend.",1
"Not a fan of this palette, the colors are beautiful but the matte eyeshadows I got were really dry and chalky and really hard to work with. everytime I would try to blend out the purple or orange matte shades they blended out to nothing. the shimmers and duo chrome colors are sooo smooth and buttery, both complaints about those, just the matte colors. also the brand isn^t cruelty free!",0
"I wanted to love this, but it turned my face into a giant oily greaseball before the end of the day. And I don^t even have oily skin! I tried this with/without two different primers, and with/without setting powder--same results. \n\nTo echo the other comments: it starts separating from the face pretty quickly and transfers even with primers and setting powder. A mess.\n\nIt gets a star for color matching but, unfortunately, that^s all.",1
"and i^m impressed! i was shocked that this product worked--i was extremely skeptical since all the other products i tried were not successful in helping fade away my stubborn acne scars. i know that you^re supposed to wait 4-6 weeks to see results, but i can^t believe how much my acne scars have faded in two and a half weeks! i can^t wait to see what my results are in six weeks! even though it^s expensive, i^ll be buying again!",0
"*I received this as a free product from an Influenster VoxBox*\nThe formula of the product is on the creamy side and is very light. It feels like I^m not even wearing lipstick. Application is very user friendly and glides on the lips in one swipe. Most lip products I have tried from Kat Von D are very pigmented, like this one, and usually apply in one swipe. Some products are even hard to remove, but this lipstick was easy to clean off as well. I have been trying to attempt a full day of wear, but I^m a clarinetist, and I cannot play my instrument with lipstick on. However, I have worn this product for half a day and it has lasted and stayed in place.",0
"The product itself is pretty good. Not a huge fan of the packaging though. When you close it, some of the product seeps out and messes up your makeup bag. I learned I prefer concealer that comes in a tub",1
"i received this from influenster on the #CleanAndChicVoxBox was the Bionic Liquid Blush by @milkmakeup. Its a 90% natural liquid blush that can be sheer or layered for a more intensive look. I got the color Fly and I wanted to like it but it was too oily for my skin. I love the fact that it is infused with Hyaluronic Acid but the areas i would use it, i am just too oily this time of year. I will try it out again in a few months when my skin balances out. Also, they included their amazing #Hydrogrip Primer which is #holygrail",1
"this product was gifted by Bobbi Brown.  Identifying your shade for a new foundation can be a challenge at times. That was not my experience with this foundation. The swatch photos are very helpful and I was able to quickly identify my exact shade match. The foundation provides light to medium coverage. However, you can build it up to a fully medium coverage. It does not feel heavy on the skin and covers red spots easily. I don^t normally set my foundation with powder but with this one I had to. I left a bit of that sticky feeling I dont like on my skin.",1
I bought this because I have owned the alchemist palette for some time and I love it.  I saw that this was teal (my favorite color) so I decided to buy.  first of all: excellent hi-light.  I truly love it.  Only downside I found was that it^s not quite teal so much as just irridescent.  :/,1
It definitely reduces the redness I have from rosacea but not quite as well as Makeup Forever^s green primer. This also feels a bit greasy when I put it on but that feeling doesn^t last. I like the product and makeup seems to go on well over it.,1
"This serum combines all my favorite skincare ingredients into one: hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and ferulic acid perfectly formulated to work together. I found this to be perfect to battle my skincare concerns (dehydration lines, dark/sun spots, occasional acne marks) while plumping and preserving elasticity. The texture and finish is great for my combination skin, absorbs in seconds and feels like you have nothing on, only better relieving any tightness or dryness immediately. This is recommended for use with the matching moisturizer to seal it in, but in my opinion any moisturizer you like will only enhance the effects of this serum. Can^t say enough good things about it, you have to try it out for yourself!",1
"I have extremely sensitive skin and always need to spot test for some days before using a product on my whole face. I didn’t have many worries with this as it is so clean and free from many irritants.  The gel formula is soothing with aloe included and make is cleansed thoroughly. If you’re like me and have sensitive skin, check this one out!",0
"The pigment in this lip color is great.  The staying power is not there.  It does not make your lips feel dry or cracked.  I bought it for a wedding, and as I said the staying power IS NOT THERE, so I returned it.  \n\nWanted to bad to love it!",1
"I had high hopes for this product as I^ve read the great reviews online. When I first tried this using their mit, I was super careful, made sure product dried and kept loose clothes on. I washed it off after 8 hours and by morning it was uneven on my arms and legs. 2nd time I left it on for only 4 hours, and stood the entire time. Same thing! You can^t see where you^re putting the product as it doesn^t develop right away. Smells nice though lol face drops are intense too! 3 drops max!",1
"I refrained myself from buying this for a long time, seeing all the bad reviews and how old it is. It^s fall and soon winter and this is the perfect palette, is very versatile. \nHeart burn and Hunny slope are perfect blushes for a light medium skin and almost no glitter. \nThe middle one, contrary to most of the reviews, is one of my least favorites as highlighter, it has some chunky glitter in a blueish grayish tone that doesn^t work for me. I prefer the lilac and baby blue ones (scandal ice and chillz) for that purpose. \nIn general all can be topper for shadow, and the middle one and electric blue one are really nice for that.\nMinus 1 star because if you don^t use primer fall out can happen.",1
"A little goes a long way with this product, I barely need to press the pump to get enough product to spread around both eye area. The eye cream is lightweight but I can feel a slight tightening effect and leaves my dry undereye area feeling hydrated. Never caused any milia which is always a  plus!\n\nI received this product as a free sample.",0
"Wow! This lightweight gel really helps to even skintone and smooth out my skin^s texture. I have been using it for a week now and my skin feels soft and looks glowy, not oily, when I wake up in the morning. Before I was using a $70 glycolic acid serum I got from my esthetician. For the price and what it does, this is a bargain.",1
I love Rare Beauty! but all the other reviews are right! This brush is so coarse and prickly it is like blending your blush out with one of those little finger nail brushes at the nail salon. The bristles are just so hard. And it does not work that well either. I prefer my it cosmetics brush immensely to this.,1
"Y^ALL. This is the only liner EVER to stay put on my waterline! Every liner I^ve used before just slides right off, gunking up my lower lashes. Not only does this formula last all day, it^s pigmentation is so impressive--the perfect finishing touch for a dark smoky eye. HOT TIP: use less product than you think you need (scrape the doefoot on the edge of the bottle), and DAB, don^t DRAG the applicator. This liner is buildable, so let dry and apply again until you achieve the look you want.",1
"I did not like this mascara^s performance. It has good ingredients. I like the concept of serum like ingredients to strengthen lashes. I don^t like the brush. I can see companies are trying to be innovative with brushes, but I think one side should have some fluffy bristles. I found this made my lashes look a bit spidery. I didn^t get any volume. I didn^t have any smudges and it washed off easily. But with Dior Iconic Overcurl and using the Dior Lash Maximizer, I can make my lashes look really nice for an everyday look where it can look like you are wearing individual lashes. I^m so glad I tried it from the point perks and didn^t purchase it, because it would be a return!",1
"These lipsticks are amazing! This collectiom has a vast array of shades to choose from, which is awesome. They are comfortable to wear and are absolutely one of the best matte liquid lipstick formulas I^ve tried thus far.",1
I tried a new skincare serum which seriously dried me out and made my forehead lines more apparent. One drop of this applied after my lighter serums softened those lines immediately. Very happy I took a chance on this product.,1
"I had a facial at a  L^Occitane^s NYC store using their products  of course. The esthetician recommended this product to use under my moisturizer at night only. I went back after 2 months (Yes, she actually remembered me.) After a few minutes of analyzing and touching my face, the esthetician remarked that my skin felt and looked firmer. Recently my mom mentioned that my face was less swollen and I did not lose any weight. I have noticed less puffiness around eye bone area and a little less all around sagginess. I have sensitive skin so it did not irritate it at all. \n\nIf you want to take some tiredness out of your facial skin without visiting a doctor this may be the product to use.",1
"This is the prettiest blush I have ever used! It provides a subtle flush of color, and I honestly have noticed that it seems to minimize my pores. It just looks so natural. It is definitely worth the price!",1
"I love this toner! I have combination skin, with a very oily t-zone and this stuff works so good for me. It gets rid of all of the dirt that is still on my face after I wash it and it makes my face feel so clean. I will definitely buy more of this when I run out.",1
"This color, as well as the color ^^b.bold,^^ are pretty much the same on me. Both colors come up as a reddish mauve, which is pretty, but it just isn^t a color I could see myself wearing that often. Also, the applicator is big, which would normally be alright, but... it also angles back, so you cannot grab enough of this lip oil with it. The shape and the amount that the applicator can grab, work together to make this product VERY hard to actually use.",0
"I was looking for a shade that matched my old lipstick and after trying 7 different brands, I finally found it!\nthe color is almost the same. I just wish this one had more shine to it as that makes my thin lips look plumper.\nHappy!",1
"This mask is very hydrating. It is also very thick which is why i took away a star. I like masks that can be easily applied. I stand by the silicone brushes to apply any and every mask I own, I feel that way you aren^t wasting much product by washing it down the drain when you have to wash the product off of your hands. When I tried using a brush with this mask it was so thick that it just fell off the silicone onto my shirt, counter etc.--which I did not enjoy, but nevertheless I ended up applying with my hands and yeah, it was still very chunky but it applied. it almost melts into your skin while you^re applying it. the color of this mask isn^t as green/opaque as I thought it would be. but other than the difficulty I had applying it, wearing it is a breeze. I also enjoy that it isn^t a 30 min mask. some other hydrating masks I have take much longer than this one whether it be a peel mask or clay. This mask definitely hydrates my skin to the GODS! and I will continue to use it, and will reccommended it to anyone needed some hydration in their skin care routine. I recieved this product complementary for testing purposes and all thoughts are my own.",1
"Everything about this moisturizer is delightful, right from the packaging to the scent of the product. The jelly texture is very unique and feels cooling on the skin. Absorbs quickly without any stickiness. Leaves my skin hydrated.",1
"I^ve used melt eyeshadows since they started making the eyeshadow stacks. I have every stack so far and this one is not very good. Not pigmented, color barely shows on my lids. So sad because some of their products are amazing.",1
"This primer is one of the best that I^ve tried that suits well with my combination acne prone skin. It works well throughout the day with blurring  and keeping me from looking super oily. I love the fact that it has salicylic acid, which helps with breakouts. I received this face primer complimentary from Influenster.",1
"Had my eye on these and finally purchased. The picture looks pretty good compared to the actual product. comes with 4 in the set but really get just 2 colors. Moonlight and taupe are very very similar in color. the Pink and Amethyst are very similar. These are SO sparkly, the micro sparkles end up all over your face. Too prices for all the mishap, it^s going back.",1
This primer goes on so smooth! I wish it was a little more of a matte finish as I tend to get shiny after a few hours. Kept my makeup on all day very well but didn’t work any better or worse than other primers.,1
"I^m surprised at the negative reviews! The packaging is stunning and the colours are gorgeous, I have Thankful & Praise. The texture is different - it^s very light & sheer. It^s true that it doesn^t last too long, but it^s a balm... and while it lasts, I think it feels great and has a nice, dewy finish on the lips.",1
"When I first applied this product, it looked and felt like a primer, it has a silicone look and feel to it. I applied it, and it felt just like a primer. I had to re-read the packaging. When I moved on to my next step, my face looked UNBELIEVABLE! No pores and my face looked even all over!!! This isn’t a product that will cover up blemishes or scars but if you just want a beautiful natural look, this is perfect. You look instantly blurred. Worked so much better than I expected. I wore this to run errands and my face was matte the entire time.",0
"So about 4 yrs ago I bought this Lancome foundation and loved it! I used every last drop but didnt repurchase cuz I started getting into the dewy light Korean/ Japanese Bb creams. Now i wanted a full coverage foundation. Since then I had forgotten about Lancome and my search for new longwearing full coverage foundations began. I am kinda really picky with foundations because to color match me is not easy and I want long wear & full coverage. I have literally tried: Becca, Nars Radiant long wearing, laura mercier new longwearing one, tarte new water foundation?, Make up Forever new ultra HD foundation, Tarte new h2o foundation, Two Face born this way foundation, Urban Decay all nighter, Estee Lauder double wear, Bareminerals original powder foundation and I decided to try this Lancome Tient idole in 370w and it was love all over again. I thought with all the new formulas of longwearing foundations I would like something better but nope. This is a beautiful foundation. longwearing with my KVD lock it setting powder. I have combo asian skin.",1
I really enjoy this primer. It has a nice texture that makes my skin feel smoother. It made my makeup collection better. I^m a head sweater so I don^t think it helped me personally with limiting my oily areas from getting slick.,0
"I received this in the Sephora Luxe favorites, and I have been trying just about all sorts of moisturizers, but majority of the ones I^m looking for with all the benefits I want just don^t lay on my skin under my makeup. Not until I tried this one. I definitely need moisture big time, because I use pure retinol. My skins so sensitive to it, It never got use to it No matter what tips the professionals recommend. I^m not sure what drug store sells a moisturizer for a dollar that remotely holds a candle to this, because I^ve seen them all. I give them all a big fat F. This melts into my skin, it doesn^t ball up and fall off. it^s like silk. It^s beautiful and my skin is so soft and balanced out. I absolutely love it. I^m so happy Sephora put it in their favorites. or there^s a big chance I may have not checked it out. So thanks Sephora keep dropping in those awesome box favs. FYI ladies, it^s so worth it. start with the .05 size.",1
I received this product free for my honest review from Influenster and MUFE. I love MUFE powders. I currently use and love the MUFE powder foundation. This powder was really nice and fine. It worked well and blurred my skin. My only complaint is that the color was a little to yellow for my liking. The packaging was nice and sleek and the powder puff was really nice!,0
"Love how fresh my skin feels the next morning:) It refreshes and hydrates overnight  and after you wash it all off, your skin is no e and smooth.  Only downfall is, if you roll around when you sleep like me, it gets very messy. Got a free sample to try and I may purchase the full size.",1
"I^ve literally tried a dozen face mists - from the drugstore brands to the high end mists on Sephora.  This is one of the best.  It^s a cooling mist which is great on these hot summer days and has the added sun protection.  The mist isn^t as fine as the Glow Watermelon face mist and you can get better sun protection with Neutrogena^s sunscreen face mist.  Still, this is in my top 3 (beats Caudalie, Supergoop, Olay, etc) and I carry the mini everywhere.  Has a light, pleasant coconut smell too.",1
"Smells amazing. Few drops into your palm, gently pat onto your face right after a shower. My skin feels ^^wet^^ again and serves as a great step 1 before serum(s) and moisturizer. Effective and very comparable price point.",1
"This product is a gel.  I love it for two reasons:  It moisturizes my skin enough after a shower to take away any of the itchiness I tend to get afterwards, and it absorbs well.\nI^m interested in experimenting by using it on my eyebrows, which tend to get flaky during the winter.  I suspect the formula will moisturize without adding greasiness that can ruin the rest of my makeup.",1
"I like it alot, but I love sparkle and shine so this was practically made for me.\n The mattes are pretty good transition shades, but the sparkle is definitely the stars of this palette. the brush it comes with sucks but they always do, and the packaging is bomb!!",1
"The only good thing about this product was that you didn^t need to use very much. After a month of use, I see NO difference, my skin stings when I put it on, and it made my jawline break out with large pimples. Will be returning when local Sephora is open.",1
It enhances my natural lip color and gives a nice flush to my face. What I like more is it does not chap my lips (easy to chap). I have looked for many lipsticks and colors in recent years and this is my favourite so far,1
"Lancome kohl pencils are literally the ONLY pencils that have knocked it out of the park for waterline eyeliner.  A super long time ago they had a color called Black Lapis that was beautiful and I wore for more years than I^ll ever admit to.\n\nRecently I have tried so many pencils specifically for my waterline and they have all been disappointments.  Until, I saw this one. You just need to warm it on the skin really quickly and it glides on with rich beautiful solid color.  And the staying power is quite amazing, it doesn^t get patchy or wear off at all. \n\nI love this and am so glad I found it. I will forever swear by lancome pencils.",1
"At first I didn^t know what to expect, when I swatched it for the first time, I thought the texture was interesting. I do have to layer it to get it where I want it as far as intensity, but I^m in love with it! I don^t have to worry about going too hard, because it literally melts on my cheeks. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and Will be purchasing full size.",1
"I am super pale, and it is almost impossible to find foundations that match my skintone. I have dry skin, and I always worry about foundations that might pick up on my dry flaky skin. I found that this foundation did a great job of covering my pink/redness, and was light enough for my skin. The undertones were good - often with lighter foundations they end up having olive tones, but this one was great. \nI received this foundation complimentary for testing purposes!",0
"I don^t mind this cream, it actually did soothe my sensitive skin, however this is a bit pricey for what it is. I wish I read the ingredients a little closer though before purchasing. Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract are the last ingredients on the list... This feels a bit deceptive since this is labelled as a cica/centella asiatica cream.",0
"I received this product complimentary and am thoroughly impressed by it. It has only been 30 days and I already see an improvement. My lashes had been destroyed by years of extension and with the direct help of Lashfood, they are finally growing in strong. I fully intend to purchase this product to continue use after my supply is out.",1
"I have oily, combination, sensitive skin. I love the gentle milky texture of this cleanser! It is very effective and gentle at removing dirt, oil and makeup. I did receive a complimentary sample for review purposes. In my opinion I would recommend and  purchase this as a cleanser.",1
"I used this for the first time today in the morning  and I had an instant glow!! So far I love it. And just tonight I was washing my face and noticed that the redness around my nose is kind of faded. I was say it could be this serum that did it, so I will continue to use it and monitor.",1
Best for super sensitive skin. I have seborrheic dermatitis and super sensitive red cheeks. I love this cleanser and it always makes my sling feel hydrated after using and not tight and itchy like other cleansers I^ve used.,1
"The only foundation I^ve found for cool undertone that actually matches my skin tone!! This stays on all day, and I apply this using KVD foundation brush #10. It blends in so naturally with my skin tone, and covers my whole face with just a single pump.",1
"Night cream showed immediate improvement in my face the next morning, though some dry residue was left over on my forehead, that was just from using a bit too much product, and that leads into why the travel size is PERFECT.\nJust a little bit of this goes a long way, too much could dry your skin (most moisturizer  do this, but this also seems to be the main complaint with this product), but using it evenly can give most skin tones amazing results.\nThese are the best set of creams and serums of ever used. Also, the creamsicle smell of the serum is absolutely dreamy, it^s my favourite part of my routine.",0
I have a habit of licking my lips whenever I felt it^s dry. So it^s extremely chap in the winter. I love how my lips felt relieved and soft after applying this lip balm! Wish it has a smaller size for my jeans pocket.,1
"First off, I purchased this with my own money. Secondly, I wanted to love this so badly because I wanted ^^glass skin^^ but man it stinks so bad. It smells like rotten pineapples that have been in the trash for a week. The smell doesnt dissipate for at least an hour after applying even with moisturizer. so I smell pee in my face for awhile when I get go work. I^ve been using for about 2 weeks and each time I apply I get a horrible migraine. I tried pushing past the smell for skin sake but I^ve noticed everytime I apply it I get very itchy and bumpy around my chin and jawline. I love glow recipes watermelon products but I^m definitely returning this to sephora. once my skin is irritated it^s a no for me. packaging is adorable but at the end of the day I^m paying for the product itself which is rancid. (p.s I have no allergies either)",1
"My skin is dry and sometimes I have issues getting heavy moisturizers to actually soak into my skin. This product is light enough to soak into my skin fully but still very, very moisturizing.   It has a very light watermelon smell that^s really nice as well, I^d highly recommend it.",1
"Ha I just want to say that I started to hate mascara, its becoming a hassle to take off. But this one is amazing I received this product as a free sample^^\xa0and let me just say that I went a bought 2 more I love it.",1
"I^m in love with this exfoliating toner! I use it daily before applying my moisturizer. In a matter of less than 2 weeks my skin has completely transformed. It helped with uneven skin texture and clogged pores. My skin feels smooth and looks healthier. I do recommend using a good moisturizer when using this toner, it can be a bit drying. \nI recived this product complimentary from Algenist",1
"Love this new product from OleHenriksen! Smell is great, fine lines and pores are visibly smaller after just a few uses. In the beginning my face felt oily but now its adjusted just fine. I^m so glad I recieved this product to try as part of an Influnenster campaign. I^ll definitely be adding this to my skincare routine!",1
This is the first stick foundation I’ve ever tried and I see what all the fuss is about. I typically wear It CC or  It cc illumination which I do like but there is a finished elegance to this foundation stick. When I want to look extra dressed up and elegant this is my new favorite! I’m surprised that I was able to select the perfect colour but Sephora has such good descriptions. I’m light Irish skinned with pink to neutral undertones and this colour 215 Buff Neutral is lovely!,1
"This is an awesome product, the coverage is amazing. I was a bit skeptical at first about it being to thick, but once I tried it I was hooked! It^s not thick or heavy, lasted all day. I have oily skin so I was worried about it coming off, but NO...worked all day !! I also used it to conceal a tattoo on my wrist.. jaw dropping !! it does take several layers of concealer and powder to cover tattoos depending on how dark the tattoo is..but it^s definitely worth buying the mini to try it out..powder lasts way longer than the concealer, but it^s worth it !!",1
"the most perfect product I ever bought for bronzing. BUY IT!!!!\n\nit gives you the perfect bronzed glow. perfect for vacation, when your in a rush, and good amount of coverage too.\n\nworth every penny!!",0
"Just like other Hourglass powders, these powders are so flattering! Any time I use this I get compliments on my skin. I also have oily skin and these don’t seem to make it more obvious. The packaging is pretty cheap looking, so hopefully the company sees all of these reviews and leaves the packaging as limited edition. I highly suggest this palette because of how flattering it is!",0
The all nighter ultra glow face primer lives up to its name. The primer made my skin feel hydrated without feeling overly greasy.  I paired this with a water based foundation and it worked really well together. It gave me the luminous look I prefer.  I really like the texture of this formula. My look lasted all day without feeling sticky. I will definitely purchase after this tube is empty❣️,1
"I originally got a small sample of this, and after one use I knew I had to purchase the full size. though it is pricey, a little goes a long way. I^ve been using this once a week and love the way my skin looks and feels. after each use, it looks brighter and feels incredibly soft. I follow the directions exactly as printed and have had no bad effects. everyone^s skin is different, so I do recommend you sampling it before committing. I love the fact this has vitamin c, the smell of step 1 is so sweet. besides the soft and bright skin, I have noticed a more even skin complexion; I do have sun spots from previous sun exposure. I have found the perfect peel to add to my regime. it does feel like a scrub but not too abrasive. when you are using step 1, I recommend you massage it evenly on your face. don^t just concentrate on one area to avoid redness afterwards, scrub it evenly.  I 100% reccomend this!! definitely holy grail!",1
This is a great mascara!! When you think of a high end mascara this is it. The formula is thick but not clumpy at all. It doesn^t run or flake which is always a problem for me since my eyes are very watery. I absolutely love it. I would buy this. I received this mascara complements of influenster.,1
*I recieved this in influenster* I^m combo skin. I didnt feel like this primer blurred anything but it was very hydrating. the texture is like a very thick moisturizer with a really delicious smell. however I did see that this primer gave me a lot of glow under the foundation. its long lasting and glowy. for me I personally didnt think like it because it doesnt blur pores.,1
"Love it! I go nuts over coconut scented products and this turned my lips into a Pina colada. Great hydration instantly and it lasted quite a while without feeling overly greasy or too sticky. Great lip chap for the price, gives me a mini holiday every time I use it.",0
"These\xa0are\xa0excellent\xa0value\xa0for\xa0money.\xa0\nMy\xa0skin\xa0was\xa0continuing\xa0to\xa0clear\xa0up. I\xa0didn^t\xa0get\xa0any\xa0new\xa0breakouts\xa0while\xa0using\xa0them,\xa0and\xa0I\xa0haven^t\xa0had\xa0any\xa0since\xa0then.\xa0I\xa0saw\xa0that\xa0old\xa0acne\xa0scars\xa0were\xa0becoming\xa0less\xa0deep,\xa0almost\xa0as\xa0if\xa0they\xa0were\xa0new\xa0scars.\xa0I\xa0believe\xa0that\xa0if\xa0peels\xa0are\xa0used\xa0regularly,\xa0they\xa0will\xa0eventually\xa0disappear.\xa0\nOverall,\xa0my\xa0pores\xa0have\xa0shrunk,\xa0my\xa0skin\xa0has\xa0cleared\xa0up,\xa0and\xa0old\xa0scarring\xa0has\xa0faded\xa0slightly.",1
"I have darker, dirty blonde hair and this shade was perfect for me. The brow colors were richly pigmented and took minimal effort to apply. The define and highlight colors were also very easy to apply but do require a bit of blending in. I found this to be very long-wearing (it is currently August), yet simple to remove. I really enjoyed how easy this product makes doing my brows! I used to carry around two different pencil colors AND a highlight shade and now I only need this one product! What a genius idea! Note: I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1
"I have used this for the past 2 years and love it.  It doesn’t break out my sensitive, acneic skin, and it doesn’t dry it out.  I’m visiting in Louisville right now and both Sephoras say they don’t have any b/c it’s being discontinued or reformulated.  Don’t discontinue it and don’t change it!   Geez.",1
This serum gives such a beautiful glow under makeup and really blurs my pores and fine lines! I love the clean ingredients that have many other benefits for my skin too! Can^t wait to try other products from this brand!,1
"I must admit that when I purchased this mask, I didn^t read the description and assumed it was a mask like the others and not a one-minute mask to remove makeup. The fit wasn’t the best but I really like the feel of the material on my skin. There was a good amount of product but it didn^t drip, only when I squeezed the mask afterwards did product come out. It also had a light floral type scent. Once I removed the mask, I had the oil on my skin that turned milky as I used warm water to wash it off. It did a good job at removing light makeup and my dry sensitive skin felt soft afterwards. It is pricey for what it is though. I just wish they could make one similar to this that you don^t have to wash-off.",1
"I cannot believe how quickly this sinks into the skin.  I mean it is almost immediate.  I have combo to oily skin and after absolutely hate any day cream that makes me have that greasy feeling.  I was blown away.  It does hydrate but I am not sure if you have dry skin if it would be enough.  for me, this is perfection.  normally I use a mattifying day cream but this is replacing it.  It balances my skin and I am not oily.",1
Okay so I got this for its high pigment in the summer to enhance my tan but I gave it a try now (it^s winter here and I am extremely pale) I am amazed that something with such high pigment can be blended to give a subtle glow and contour...I can imagine it would be even better with an actual base tan. Glowy summer goddess here I come!!!,1
"Best brow product ever. Looks very natural and is even easier and quicker than a powder and stiff brush. If you accidently get some on your skin it^s super easy to remove (like dab with a clean q-tip easy) but stays on your brows all day no smearing or running. It will deepen color, fill in, and tame any hairs. If your overall brow shape is good you won^t need any other products. I actually do my brows daily vs just when I do full eye makeup it^s so quick and easy.",1
"Amazing product! the metallic rose gold color is absolutely gorgeous. great for a natural full lid application in a pinch. the color payoff is amazing, the color is very easy to apply with a finger. definitely buying another one!!",1
"I love this blush!  I can see this line becoming an emerging obsession for me.  When I first opened the product I was a bit dismayed by how deep the color is (I^m blonde, green eyed, with light-medium skin).  However, despite the color payoff, it blends beautifully.  I use in on cheeks, eyes (blended with gold/bronze it makes a wonderful base for a rose gold eye) and I LOVE this color on my lips!  I^m sure there are going to be other baby cheeks shades in my future...",1
"After 4 unsuccessful tries i finally found my shade, unfortunately it^s the worst foundation i have ever purchased! \n1st star, b/c i like Ri Ri, \n2nd star, the shade is perfect for my skin tone, almost too perfect..to bad i won^t buy again\nAs difficult as it is to find the perfect shade and for me to come this close is a huge disappointment..\nSo whenever applying my foundation i add 2 pumps to my damp beauty blender and walla..\nHowever, Fenty foundation is very drying, making it difficult to blend, and because of this, i^m using way too much product just so i can get an even look, This is extremely frustrating when the rest of my makeup is flawless, so i tried applying it w/ mt fav foundation brush and also w/ a dry BB and still difficult to blend, maybe i^ll try adding a drop of oil next time.\nPrimer, i have used to many to count, Fenty primer is at the bottom of my list, there is no staying power, it does not hold my foundation in place so after a couple of hrs my makeup is all over my face,\nTrophy wife, i use only as an eyeshadow,\nHighlighter brush, is the only item so far worth my money.\nBecause i^m so disappointed in every item i purchased from this line i don^t bother to look at anything new she puts out.",1
I like it. Its very natural not heavy at all which i love. i think its great for an every day makeup look. Not full coverage but it is semi buildable. But i love it cause i hate feeling caked up and this is so lightweight i forget i have it on. i recomend for those who dont wear makeup often or dont like to but want a little bit of coverage,0
"this serum dries quickly it doesn^t have an overpowering smell so far I haven^t noticed any difference in my skin, I did have a small amount of break out when I first started using this product but it has gone away and I haven^t have any sense I^ll still continue to use to see if it does make a difference after a longer time of uses, it^s not a bad product at all and I would recommend it, I received this product  free for review from influenster",1
This is my first plumping gloss I^ve bought and honestly can^t tell if it plumps my lips. Will just say that the color is terrific and it lasts for ages. Does not smear. Just a great lip color to wear!,1
"Love this product! It originally came as a sample in one of the Sephora Favorites kit I bought about a year ago, and I^ve repurchased the regular size several times since. It stings slighty, but afterwards, you will definitely see and feel a difference in your skin! I follow with a light serum to soothe and lock in moisture.",1
"I am LOVING this mascara. It^s dark, makes my lashes so full looking and zero clump. Dare I say, even better than my ^^They^re Real!^^ mascara? I love the packaging. Makes me feel like I^m going to be able to get ALL the product out since I can squish it around unlike a normal hard plastic tubing. The down side to this stuff is the actual mascara formula seems like it is drying out fast. I guess that^s better than an over liquidy formula. It^s all about the wand on this thing! I normally only go for the rubbery, spikey wands because I like the separation, but I can^t get enough of how my lashes look with thid! You can switch up to any formula you like and this wand will deliver!",1
"I bought this product who has hyper pigmentation after her 2nd pregnancy. She had lost a lot of self confidence because of her dark spots on her cheeks. I bought her this brightening cream alongside the Vitamin C serum and in a month I can tell a difference in the appearance of her dark spots. they have lightened quite a bit and she is loving the product. If you have hyper pigmentation, I advise to use this product and apply for at least a month alongside the Vit C serum from the same line and see the difference, you will not be disappointed.",0
"I^m surprised some people got broken palettes because mine came encased in a protective buffered box, wrapped in plastic bubbles, & surrounded by excess paper. None of my shadows are broken, but I guess I^m lucky. The palette itself is more beautiful in person than in pictures. It is so complimentary to literally every other palette I own, even my Neon huda palette. These are soft and blendable. Im so happy I got this.",1
"I grabbed it with no true intentions of using it every day, but I have been pleasantly surprised and use this more than my beautyblender sponge. It is SO soft and my skin looks airbrushed after using this to set my powder (I use a compact daily but I love it for setting my loose powder too). \n\nI also love how it has a slot for my fingers so when I am doing my eye makeup I use this as well. Overall a versatile piece for your makeup kit.",0
"Throw away all your acne products! This little bottle is amazing. I use it every night before going to bed and my skin has never looked better. It^s a little pricey but hey it works. Well done clinique, I^m a fan.",0
"I think I wanted this to be like the Drunk Elephant solid face cleansers but it really isn^t. The price point is pretty great for Sephora but even for $5 I can get a body soap/wash that will moisturize way better from the drugstore. I would not recommend this at all for facial use as it is too intense and stripping (that squeaky feeling) instead of being moisturizing like it said it was. The fragrance is pretty intense and although I really don^t want to get into that debate, I will say that it^s pretty high up on the ingredients last and we^re all concerned about what can be hidden under that umbrella of fragrance as every ingredient included in it does not need to be listed. Either way sodium hydroxide (lye) that is typically in soap is not something you want to put on your face. I would pass.",1
"Beautiful palette, great formula. Not sure what else to say; it^s worked great for me. It^s pigmented, blends smoothly, does everything I ask it to do. Except the dishes...it hast done that yet. Still trying.",1
"I got this sample size for $7 through a code.  I don^t think the formula itself is bad, it^s not too dry or too wet, too thick or too thin.  But this wand is weird and doesn^t do anything for me.  The paddle just felt awkward to hold and didn^t seem to achieve any more curl, lift or volume than a regular mascara wand.",1
I have this Mascara a 3 out of 5 stars only for the simple fact that it^s far from Waterproof or even Water resistant.  I specifically purchased this for that one feature for a yearly  Canoe trip. Obviously us ladies still need to keep it classy and have a little somethin somethin on our face.  lol Well let^s just say thank god I didn^t go all the way under the water or I would have had the usual black streaks down my face. Instead I sweat a little and got lightly splashed with sunglasses on and I just ended up with raccoon eyes. OTHERWISE this mascara is perfect! Goes on nicely and doesn^t flake or cause irritation.,1
"This is an American brand created by a Taiwan founder. People should know that they are buying a Japanese inspired product which appropriates Geisha culture.  I go to Japan every year, and there is no Tatcha in Japan. The salespeople at SK-II and Shiseido don^t consider Tatcha to be Japanese either. I have tried Silk and Water cream, and both leave a lot to be desired. There are many gel like moisturizers available for 20% of this cost.",0
"I really like this toner due to my acne prone skin. The ingredients in this product do truly help clear my hyperpigmentation due to acne and clear up my acne due to the AHA^s. I stopped using the product for a couple weeks and really noticed the difference since I was breaking out more. I used it on my face and neck but I had a really bad reaction on my neck. The skin on my neck became very dry and no moisturizer helped. I also got dark and white spots that I^m pretty sure was sun damage due to being out in the sun without sunscreen. My skin is now back to normal and the spots have mainly gone away. Overall I really like this product but I wouldn^t use it on sensitive areas such as the neck, chest or eye area.",0
SunnyDays SPF 30 Tinted Sunscreen Foundation gives a very natural coverage but evens out my skin tone. I really love the SPF30 and this one has SPF but still feels very light on the skin (compare to some other SPF that^s greasy). I^ve never tried this brand before but will definitely continue using it!,0
This is a very smooth and pigmented lip color. I have the shade scarlet rouge. It glides on smoothly and it has a very nice punch of color. However it is a very creamy formula so it will transfer and I feel like I will need to wear a lip liner with it whenever I use it. Over all though this is a very beautiful lip color very luxurious very high end feeling.,1
"I love mixing this into plain yogurt to add sweetness or up the protein in my smoothies.That being said, this is not something that’s particularly tasty by itself because algae always tastes a little fishy. I use half a scoop (1/2 tablespoon) as a serving a couple of times a day, versus the recommended two-scoop (2 tablespoon) serving. I’ve noticed that my hair has gotten shinier since I added this to my regimen, and I find that I feel less stressed during my workdays, too. Thinking about trying the chocolate next.",0
"I do love these wipes! There are others I like as well but the price point is so good with Sephora. That said, the packaging isn’t always the best and the plastic lid frequently falls off the package that the wipes are stored in. Other than that I love them!",1
"Amazing powder! I have combo skin, and I do not get shiny face at all with this powder. It wears well all day. It leaves a beautiful airbrushed finish. I’ll never use another powder. PS: it does not set in my fine lines at all.",1
"color not as pictured, it was more on the orange undertone than a true candy apple red. it went on very thick and was not easy to apply and look natural. purchased because it was lunar new year package... won^t fall for that again",1
"This came in a 500 point beauty reward I recently got.  I would have to say this is one of the best clay masks I^ve ever used.  I have oily skin and large pores.  Noticed immediately afterwards that my pores were slightly smaller, and the mask left my face with a matt finish.\n\nThe only thing I don^t like is how it dries, and tightens the face.  So many companies now make face masks that don^t dry out, and I^ve gotten spoiled with that.  However, this isn^t a pampering mask, this is what I like to call a ^task^ mask.\n\nI^d purchase and add this in my skincare regimen.",1
These do a good job on keeping my skin clear and smooth. Also the pads make it easy for application. The biggest drawback for this is the alcohol in the product. It is the first ingredient...and it definitely smells like it alcohol when you apply it. Sometimes it can make my eyes water from it being so strong.,1
"Drenched in serum and super hydrating. Didn^t irritate my sensitive skin at all so if you^re skeptical, it^s a  clean product packed with skin loving ingredients that give you an instant glow. I use it before bed and leave the serum on, and wake up with more even, hydrated skin. I^ll use this once a week for an instant pick me up.",1
"I have pretty dry eye bags. \nthe first couple of times I used it, i saw little improvements . My eye bags appeared to be less puffy and more hydrated, but not something substantially different where I instantly fall in love with it. I did noticed that concealer didnt emphasize the fine lines under my eyes as much. However, three weeks after, I did not notice any difference at all. I use it 4-5 times a week.",0
"ZERO STAR!, well very drying n chalky just a piece of junk n vegan silly. Money goes on drain even I get as a gift it still a garbage please bring back the good old AB lipstick that was fantastic. Silly of bites have such ridiculous formular way super lousy .returning…",1
"My every day foundation. I love the high spf, although it does make the product really thick. I sheer it out with a wet beauty blender. And I have to be careful around my eyes, as it can crease if you use too much. I get a good medium coverage from it and I use a matte setting powder. The slight yellow tone helps me correct a lot of redness I have in my skin.",1
I was super excited to try this! But unfortunately this product needs to be fixed. All the lip masks I received had a tiny amount of liquid on the lip masks. So not super moisturizing. Not worth the price point. Please saturate them more then maybe I will repurchase.,1
"First I want to say how much I love Murad products. I am a huge skincare lover and this one fell short for my skin type and needs. I have an olive complexion and one stubborn sun spot on my cheek years old. This product states with its hydroquinone and glycolic acid it can lighten dark spots and help skin cell turnover rate. However, after nightly use for four weeks I have not noticed a difference. It tingles when you apply and does smell odd. My skin now feel dry and has way more redness that it ever does. If you are curious about trying this product I recommend purchasing the mini to see how your skin reacts.",1
"Viseart palettes are pro quality and are known for being rich, pigmented shadows that blend with ease! This one definitely lives up to the brand^s reputation! The Tryst palette is a gorgeous color story for spring, I found that all the shades were highly pigmented, blended easily and were cohesive enough to create a lovely look without needing to pull from other my palettes. That is always a plus! The all in one factor AND the size make it a PERFECT travel palette! Love the metal exterior too, so much sturdier than the plastic housed 12-pan palettes!",1
"I got this on sale because, well, I couldn^t resist at $38 CAD, even though I try to avoid her products, knowing her stance on vaccinations. I swatched in store and found the mattes somewhat disappointing. The red is actually pretty nice but the other brights are quite patchy. That said, the shimmers are to die for; buttery, smooth, pigmented. Well worth the money I spent on it. I have Metal Matte and like the shimmers in this better.",1
I^ve been looking for a palette that has pinky/warm tones but also a green colour when I stumbled upon this one. In the past all of the eyeshadow palettes I^ve owned have been from Urban Decay so I was really surprised to see that these compare quality-wise. Good colour pay off and blend-ability. I would prefer a couple more of the shimmery ones to be matte but that^s just personal preference.,0
"This stuff is pretty amazing. I lived at the beach for the last 18 years and was pretty as about moisturizing... when I did moisturize it was a gel but u add usually it was just sunscreen. I recently moved WAY up north and my skin got super dry. My nose especially is/was a mess! It started breaking out but was to scale to cover up so I tried everything...peels, scrubs, masks...even my Good Genes wasn^t helping! Finally I got a sample of this...in 3 uses my nose is so much better! I think its healing from all the torture I put it through...still some dry skin but only 3 uses! I will absolutely be a buying this at the first sign of fall! It^s too much for summer! If your skin needs a little rescue try it!",1
I loved it. super smooth. the color perfect for me. The moisture in this is just luscious.  And surprisingly it was super long lasting!!! Even with it being such a glossy finish.  my lips are pretty ok so I didn^t see much plumping. After I took it off I could definitely see less lip lines. great...I just love it!,1
"Does a great job of making the brows seem fuller.  It has good hold.  The color Haze just wasn^t a good match for me - it^s a little muddy and looks unnatural on me.  I^d buy this if it came in a better color for me, but for now, Haze is sadly being returned.",1
"First, my universal gripes: It smells awful; and charging $68 for a jar that users must repeatedly dip their fingers into is just wrong. At that price point, the dispensing method ought to be more sophisticated and sanitary.\n\nNow, my personal gripes that may or may not apply to others, depending on their skin: I^m pretty sensitive to AHAs (even so-called ^^mild^^ fruit ones) and this is no exception. Just because it^s a moisturizer doesn^t mean it won^t exfoliate the top layer of your skin right off. I think AHAs are better in occasional use products like the Dennis Gross pads. And throw in the fact that this has silicones...that^s a bad combination in my opinion. After a few days of use, my face is feeling extra shiny, oily, and clogged. Gross. One plus: it feels nice going on.",1
"I got this for a particular makeup look I wanted to try from Mary Greenwell. Honestly the formula is quite lovely and soft, within maybe, at most, a minute it sets and does not smudge but if you work quickly you^ll get a soft smudged liner. maybe it was some other product but in the outer corners I noticed an oily build up of color. I am not sure if it was the liner since I usually get that from eyeshadow. I am not an avid liner user but it feels like this can easily be used up and the pencil is very small, the formula is very smooth and creamy which is nice but it is used up quickly.",0
"This is the best skincare investment I^ve made in awhile. I bought a clarsonic 4 years ago and I stopped using it because the constant cleaning on the machine you have to do and buying new brush heads got old fast.  Plus as another reviewer put it the clarsonic isn^t as hygienic as the foreo since its a brush head and not silicone. As for the foreo none of the issues listed above apply.  It charged quickly out the box and literally all you have to do is rinse it off after using. I^m sure using a silicone safe cleanser would be fine as well every now and then. Now for the biggest reason I^m leaving this review,  MY SKIN IS GLOWING! I^ve used this for a little over a week and the results are obvious. First my skin looks brighter,  second my skin texture no longer has dry flakes and isn^t as oily. Oil reduction was my main reason for buying this. Also my skin seems to absorb products better.  I think the problem before was I wasn^t getting a deep enough clean which in turn produces more oil on the skin. This machine gives you a deep yet non harsh clean that will actually make the facial products you use effective. Worth every penny.",1
"I consider myself an eyebrow product connoisseur because I naturally have virtually no eyebrows--they^re thin and sparse--so I^m always on the lookout for a product that fills in easily leaving the result as natural as I can get considering I basically have to fill in from scratch. This pen takes a lot of patience and finesse to use, which is not something into--the easier to use the better. No matter how I tried, my eyebrows always looked like I drew them in with marker, although I^m sure if you have naturally thicker brows or more hairs it may not look as atrocious. My other complaint is that the color ^Herb^ is absolutely NOT a neutral medium brown at all, it pulls extremely warm. Overall, a very disappointing product and will be returning.",1
I like products from this brand and based my choice of a serum on that. I love this.  I  notice an increased luminosity and use it nightly.  I let it absorb prior to putting on my night cream. I will repurchase.,1
"I got my face done at the store and she used this setting spray. She told me it had a strong alcohol smell, but I didn^t expect it to be as bad as it was. Within 5 minutes of spraying this product on my face, I started to get a headache from the smell.  I only wore it for about an hour and half. I couldn^t wait to get home and get that smell off my face. it was starting to make me nauseous.  Seriously,  there is no need for a scent this strong for any cosmetic product.",1
"I used a sample of this years ago and I forgot how much I loved this stuff until recently. I know some folks hate silicon in their primers but if you have dry skin like me it^s really a game changer for your foundation^s performance. It really helps with the creasing in fine lines & patchiness plus it helps keep you looking smooth for so much longer than your regular foundation alone. It^s a must-have for me, highly recommend!",1
This is the best mascara that I^ve used in a long time. My eyes get irritated easily and if a mascara flakes it really irritates my eyes. The only time its flaked I took a nap and the side of my face that was in the pillow started flaking.,1
"This is great for my combination skin! I have issues with dryness at the same time as I break out, and it^s perfect for dealing with that! It also smells great, and the bottle has a pretty fine mist that works well.",1
"I love this. It provides an easy wash of color on my face when I^m just wanting a ^my skin but more even^ type of day. You have to blend it very well, otherwise you will look orange. I^ve been using this for 3 weeks now.",0
"I love the VV mini palettes, I found this one to be a little different than the others though. they still blend well but that red unfortunately faded. I did a full review on my yt channel but it^s not the best or the worst .",1
Definitely not pigmented enough. Applied on naked lips it does not go on evenly and is patchy and accentuates all the flaws. I scrubbed my lips thinking maybe they^re dry and used primer the next time. Still it^s not a solid colour. More like a balm application rather than a lipstick.,1
"Good eyebrow brushes are hard to come by ... they can^t be too soft, or too hard. I like this brush, it is just right, and precise enough to allow me to get a natural finish. It works well with the Brow Pomade. \n\nHowever, 1 star off only because I wish it had a mascara spoolie on the other end, to comb through my eyebrow after application, to kind of set it all together. I hate that I have to reach for a separate tool - if they just add it to the other end, this brush would be perfect, and on par with my ABH one!\n\nI received this product as a free sample.",0
"I bought this foundation because I^ve been a mate finish wearer forever, but was looking for something more luminous as I find that mattes can sometimes make you look flat.  This gave me exactly what I was looking for! The finish is definitely giving me ^^My skin but better^^ vibes. It also wore beautifully throughout the day. It did get a lil shiny, but nothing that a bit of powder couldn^t fix. So far, I^m in love!",1
"These colors were gorgeous and suited my skin tone perfectly. These colors made a gorgeous soft, nude eye for me. It looked so pretty on. The packaging was gorgeous and I loved the little suede pouch that it comes with. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.",1
All very beautiful. High shine is fact because there is a lot of glitter. Can juice up any look. I wear it by itself and as a topper. It doesn^t smudge all over or bleed into fine lines. It also isn^t sticky so don^t worry about your hair and the wind.,1
love it!! I got the mini size to try out. it smells like white wine and mint when u start it its strong at first but goes away. the spray it good. the quality is awesome I have sensitive and acne prone skin and this brands products do not give me any bad affects.,1
"I was very hesitant to try this because I have oily/combo skin.  I LOVE this primer and would recommend to anyone who is on the fence about it.  My new HG primer for sure!  Does my forehead still get oily, of course.  Nothing will change that but I do feel like this product grips to foundation or whatever you use (I use a bb cream) and is truly just great all around.",1
"i bought this on the early rouge release date almost two months ago, and wanted to wait to give it some time before writing a review. i have to say, with as much hate as this product is getting on here, i completely, wholeheartedly agree with those that have fallen in love - this is hands down the best eye cream i have ever used. my mid-30^s fine lines are FINALLY filling themselves in (!!), and my dark circles/tired eyes brighten up tremendously before those early mornings of work. i need way less concealer (going completely without the last week or so) and am generally more confident in my eye looks day after day. i use the recommended amount and have plenty of product left after daily use for several months. i hope the hate doesn^t make this product go away because i have no idea where i will turn...best product purchase i have made in maybe forever.",1
the best cleansing for acne i feel  much better my acne finally stop ... i really recommended ... and When you get rid of acne  you can use the vitamin C from clinique to clear ur skin from the acne Mark^s,1
"As soon as I saw a notification for this pop up in my Sephora app, I jumped on it right away. I missed out on previous LUXE boxes because it sold out while I was still thinking it over. This time, I added it to cart, checked out right away, and I^m so glad I did. The value on this is insane. I was most interested in the Augustinus Bader cream, and that works out to over $40 for that little tube alone. I also wanted the Tatcha cleanser, YSL nude lipstick and was curious about the fragrance. Everything else was just bonus thrown in. I received the kit the other day and now I^m tempted to buy a second set!",1
"I was really wowed by the sample I got. My skin just glows thanks to this, and it feels very smooth to the touch in the mornings.\n\nIt’s oily going on, but since I used it at night, that wasn^t a problem for me.",1
"I used a whole bottle of this, starting off just once a day then twice a day.  I liked that it went on well under my other products: no pilling or greasiness.  But I didn^t see any change in my skin, positive or negative.",1
"I love these little guys. I do wish more came in a tube, but in all fairness I did put them on pretty thick over my whole face. I still got more than one use out of them which makes it worth it for the price. It^s also super easy to mix and match masks on different parts of your face.",1
"This brush is super soft, but it soaks up too much foundation to be useful. I tried it twice and felt like I was wasting my liquid foundation because more ended up in the brush than deposited on my skin. Kinda pointless. I^ll probably keep it as a small travel powder brush in my purse.",1
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster as part of the new primer campaign. I^ve been using it for almost two weeks now and overall I would have to say it^s a great mascara! love the packaging, the wand has great full bristles and the mascara goes on nicely. Even without using an eyelash curler, I think it^s making a difference to the length of my lashes (I^m using it in combination with the Marc Jacobs primer, too!)",1
"Good brush. A bit smaller than my other foundation brush, however it still gets the job done. It doesn^t leave any weird lines or unevenness. It is easy to use and doesn^t take long to blend out my foundation. All in all I like it and will continue using it. Covers up blemishes.",1
"I have used many different self-tanners over many years, and this is the nicest, best smelling, even colored tanner I have found. I have purchased this many times, and highly recommend it for both pros and first time self-tanners!  It doesn^t feel like it^s laying on top of the skin like many others, but more like it absorbs into the skin like a moisturizer.  I love it!",1
"1st time buyer of ANY oil to balm cleanser. As there was no instructions on the item itself I thought you just rub that s*** on. Which would explain alot of reviews of it being too thick.  Nope. You have to rub it down to an oil then wipe with a face towel( I used tissue because my lazy a** didnt want t look for a face towel). I used 1 scoop and used my palm and rubbed it in for more warmth about a minute to get it down really good. I had KVD tattoo eyeliner, morphe eyeshadow, 1 coat of waterproof mascara and a little glue from eyelashes. The pics I put in are after a 12 hour workday, the rub down of the oil, me working it in, after a shower, and finally the last pics are of what it looks like in the jar and of the next morning which I think is important because You know how when a makeup remover looks like it did its job but you wake up and you still have gunk in your eyes? I didnt have that any left over residue of he product or make up and my skin did feel soft. I overall like love the product, I took a star away for lack of instructions. If i bought in the store vs online or if someone didnt have the app there would be know way of knowing how to use unless they went to YouTube or something like that.",1
"I enjoyed this eye cream, it had a subtle de-puffing effect to it that helped bring life to my tired eyes. I wish it had some more weight to it and was more moisturizing but I can’t complain. It works nicely during the morning and evening and sits nicely under my concealer without creasing, which I appreciate. It’s a nice eye cream, but similar to other Barbara Sturm products, it is quite expensive.  I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.",0
"I am only 25, and I haven^t really delved into anti aging products aside from sunscreen before this product. It applies smoothly, and I make sure to quartz roll after applying it. I apply it at night, and generally have a bit of a break out after using it, but that usually happens to me with more hydrating moisturizers.",1
"This is like a hybrid between a liquid lipstick and a lip stain. The colour is VIBRANT and the formula is long lasting. While it does not last an entire day, when it wears off it leaves the most beautiful stain on your lips. I don^t know if this is quite what YSL was going for, but i^m loving it!",1
"I purchased this highlighter after watching a makeup tutorial by Alissa Ashley. I couldn^t be happier with it! It provides high shine with a noticeable pink tint, and lasts throughout the day. Also, it smells like cookies ❤ A little goes a very long way!",1
"I love the Clear Skin Days line from Sephora. I bought everything the moment I saw it because the prices are outstanding and so are the ingredients. However, while I have loved the other products this cleanser was a total dud. At least from my own experience with it.\n\nThis cleanser dispenses as a lightweight, white foam. Prior to this face wash I had only experienced this type of foaming mechanism in hand soaps. But unlike a foam-dispensing hand soap, this did not create a lather at all. Not between my hands, and not when massaging it into my face. It^s not the highest priority for me if my cleansers create a lather, but I guess I just expected it to given its formulation. \n\nBut what I did find unforgivable is that it really didn^t feel like it was cleansing my skin. At all. Every time I have used this, regardless if I use one pump or six pumps, it feels like absolutely nothing has happened. I have oily skin so I need a cleanser that can really break down a full day of sebum production but without stripping my skin. This cleanser didn^t strip my skin, but it didn^t strip my oils either. I had the odd sensation that it cleansed my skin just slightly better than splashing plain water on my face would have. And I really gave this cleanser several chances before I just couldn^t go on like this anymore.\n\nLove this line of products but this one was a miss for me. Honestly this could be one of the worst cleansers I^ve ever used, and even though it is inexpensive there are cleansers I buy from the drugstore that do a better job.",1
"This really softens and heals my skin. On the other hand, this packaging leaves a lot to desire. It is leaning toward infantile and unnecessary. Whoever wrote the ingredients list hopefully did not also write the list of what is not in the mask. I really hope these come back without the unnecessary foolishness. This should be taken as a serious product and requires a packaging that describes it^s true benefits.",1
i got this as a Christmas present i love hjow perfect it goes on so nicely never had makeup do that so smoothly on my eyes recommend this to anyone its really amazing i was in shock how beautiful it when on my eyelids,0
"I absolutely love the serum and moisturizer. They go on so silky smooth and really illuminate my skin. If it was the 2 Little Wonders I would have given this product 5 stars. However, I really don^t care for the night gel. If you come against your face after it^s been applied, it starts to peel off and bunch up, and I just haven^t noticed any positive difference in my skin from using it.",1
"I actually love this palette despite the lacking reviews or mixed reviews. I have made some beautiful looks and I love the cream to powder formulas in this palette. The blue shimmers in here are less blue and almost more of a steal Grey tone, but I think they are spectacular on the eye. you can do wearable or dramatic looks with this palette.",1
"I love this palette! The color combination and mix of shimmer, matte, glitter is awesome! It has been the perfect way to add a little sparkle to my day. The shadows blend beautifully and layer very well. Great way to update your look!",1
"I^ve been testing different retinols and I was really excited to try this one. I am very disappointed. This feels like a very thick primer and not a treatment cream. I have only been using it for two weeks so I cannot speak to the efficacy, but I hate the texture so much that I don^t want to keep using it at all. I would recommend getting a sample of this before purchasing to make sure the texture works for you. I would  not recommend this product.",0
"Loving this way more than I thought I might!! Got a sample with my last order and have been trying to find a primer that gives me a glow but also evens out skin tone, smoothes out fine lines/pores, hydrates, and also somewhat mattiffies my complexion. I know this is LOT to ask for from one item, but this product somehow seems to meet all those requirements. It doesn^t really have any pore-filling properties, but as it takes care of all the other stuff, I don^t even care! I have been using Josie Maran argan moonstone drops as my primer for at least the past 2 yrs and I love the glow and hydration, but it doesnt seem to have any smoothing/blurring properties whatsoever. For reference, I am 36 with some fine lines and have very dry, quite fair skin and I never wear foundation, so a primer that performs those duties listed above is a requirement for me. I was nervous about the color on the CT Wonderglow when I first tried it as it is more of a golden/bronze-y looking shade compared to the Moonstone drops and I was sure it would appear orange or just wrong on me, but it looks fantastic and seemed to disappear into my skin immediately. It almost looks like I am wearing foundation (in a good way). Skin is also left very smooth, soft, and silky after applying. I just purchased a brand new full size of JM Moonstone drops a few weeks ago but will be returning it to buy this instead. To address some of the negative comments I^ve seen regarding this product, I also have very sensitive skin and the fragrance has not been an issue. I also don^t feel the sparkle is too large or adherent in fine lines - it is extremely fine particles/shimmer and not huge chunks of glitter at all. Overall extremely pleased - this is the first CT product I^ve tried and will be inclined to try others!",1
The only contour I have found that is truly grey toned and actually looks like a shadow and not orangey looking. I have had mine for an embarrassingly long time and still have enough product to keep going even though I^ve hit pan. I have the old packaging so possibly they used to have more product that the new packaging since I^m seeing other people complain how small the pan is. Low key I^m searching for a cheaper alternative but my search is a fail.,1
"I loved the original formula and design of Boscia masks, the new stuff is Good.\n\nUnscented, gentle actives, good fit on face.  If I didn^t know they had made better ones before, I^d probably want to repurchasing these ones.",1
I have small eyelid areas and hooded eyes.  Everytime I try to do a small V on the outside of my eye it turns to a glob.  With this brush I can actually do the small detail work that I^ve never been able to do before.  Wonderful brush!,1
