10 out of 10 would recommend. this mist feels amazing. its so fine and give a nice finish. plus sun protection. its a win win.  i won't set makeup. but it makes it look so smooth . i even wear it alone .,1
$14 for a pump...funny....Yes it must made in China and the cost may even under $1. why they dont just produce foundation with pump together? Because they cant make more money. Now you buy the foundation and you have to spend $14 to buy a pump!,1
"1- this product makes no promise about moisture. it does not hydrate you. \n2- it takes a while before you can see the difference. be patient.\n3- this product is not meant for young skin. not sure why it became so popular amongst teenagers/young adults to use??? it's not cheap, how are y'all affording this...\n\nI've been repurchasing SKII essence for years and it honestly makes my skin glow.  not sold on how effective it is on shrinking pores...but I've stopped using it here and there for several months at a time and my ski. just doesnt look as... nice. it is rather hard to describe just how it makes my skin look better, but it really does. I have purchased a much cheaper ""dupe"" from cosrx and if it works my wallet will be very happy. if it doesnt, I will return to my tried and true SKII.",4
"1 week of use and breakouts on my mature, combo skin.  And I didn't like it under makeup. My makeup didn't last past 2 hours and was seperating and sliding right off. I tried it with 2 different foundations that I've used for years. The scent reminds me of cleaning products.",3
"27 Rose Revelateur is balm-like with a sheen and somewhat sheer appearance. This is more like a bright pink. The mabling is very fun, but it can be a little tricky. When the purpley marbling hits your lips it leaves that spot a bit darker than the rest of your lips but not enough to marble all of you lips. The Interdit formula glides on, not heavy at all. I layered this with N315 Le Rouge and the two lasted three to four hours before I ate.",3
"2 Full sized products for less than the price of 1 full size item! What a deal! The gimme brow gel is perfect for days that you want to effortlessly have quick brows that look good. It applies easily and gives a naturally filled look to sparce brows. This mascara is great for adding natural looking length and thickness; basically your lashes, but better. I love these products because with a little gloss, and a bb cream or tinted moisturizer, you can literally walk out the door with the no make-up, make-up look.",2
"2 Years after I first used it, and yet still No results?! I questioned whether if I had been doing it correctly however I Even Called Nuface and spoke to a Rep.  I was doing it correctly, so when I read other reviews I honestly question them! Also anyone under 30 still has the elasticity within their skin cells to be able to bounce back and regenerate a more smoother appearance.  However, also within their reviews No One Ever Talks about the Metal Taste which comes about within your mouth when using this machine!? Even with their gel, I still had a Aweful Metallic taste come about within my mouth as I would swipe the machine up my cheek.  It's the Strangest thing Ever. I'm saving my cash on Surgery Now!!!",3
"3.2 oz/90 ml. Full sized? When sold separately, full sized is 3.4 oz/100 ml. Where did the 10 ml go?\nRated low for ""creativity"". On package, it  states product is full sized! Otherwise, great product.",4
"400 is so far my favorite red. My other preferred reds include Tom Ford Ruby Rush & Dior 999.\n\nwhy I love it\n1)at full opacity, it's a blue red, with very smooth application. it is not matte, not shiny, it has just the right amount of velvet and life.\n2)it fades evenly to a dark pink.\n3) it amazes me how well Armani is able to match THE RED aka 400 to the red on the package.\n4)  it shows differently on me and my daughters and complements all.\n\nwhy I dislike it sometimes\nalthough beautiful, it is extremely transferrable to all things.",1
"4 stars because like majority of brow pencils there's never enough product for the price. However I do really like this pencil. I used to use Anastasia Beverly Hills dip brow in Auburn and that was the closest color I could get to match me.(the match wasn't that great). I really wanted to try a brow pencil again and decided to go with this. I tried auburn first, it was a close match but not enough. I then ordered the dark auburn and oh my God I couldn't get over it I finally found a match for my eyebrows!! I have super dark red/auburn hair! it looks brown but in daylight and certain lighting you see the reddish hues. my eyebrows are all different shades of brown and red! \n\ni do my brows everyday so I dont think the price is worth it.\ndont let the 'fine tip' description fool you. It is pretty much average size as any retractable brow pencil. \n\nI like that I found a color to match me which is super hard.\nthe brush at the end I really like as well it is easier to blend than a spooly brush.\nI found that my brows lasted all day.\nthe consistency I really like too. I personally felt I was able to create a more gradient look versus using a dip brow. like I had more control over it versus using an angled brow brush. I haven't had any issues with breakage but I also use a very light touch when applying.\n\nI hope to see this in the future as a dip brow! \n\nI would only reccomend this product to struggling red heads like me.",1
"520 is a super super hydrating sheer lipstick. It has a beautiful shine, and will be a different pink for everyone. For me it's a beautiful natural light pink on my very pale skin. This is my favorite every day lip product. Works great over matte lipsticks too if you want one shine and hydration.\nThe only downside, because it is so emoliant the lipstick can break easily. So be gentle when applying and do not over extend it.",4
"5 star formula but the shade is way off. This was not rosy brown at all. It pulled like muted orange on my medium skin tone. Such a bummer because the formula is super nice. It's not a gloss, more like a satin lipstick. It feels really comfortable and smells sweet but has an almost minty vibe too. I looking forward to more shades and maybe I can grab a color that is right for me.",1
"5 star! I have very sensitive skin. I have frequent breakouts or reactions from a variety of product due to my medications. I had 0 negative reactions. It made my skin look, feel and smell amazing. I received this product complimentary from influenster and I'm so glad I did. It will be my go to moving forward, even for the price. It works!!!",4
5 stars!!!  This eyeliner is a bit darker then pictured. It's highly pigmented and lasts forever. It is the only liner I've used that doesn't transfer.   I highly recommend this Forest green color.  I'm getting all colors.,4
A bit hard to do taco fold because memory foam is so thick. Exterior fabric is nice and smooth although it really is a very large powder puff. I feel as I may be waisting a lot of expensive powder with such a large puff. But I must say that when finished it really sets make-up well and is comfortable to press powder into face.,3
"A bit harsh for my skin. Was trying to find a substitute for Colleen Rothschild's Mandelic Acid Serum (Mandelic Acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid) that costs $75. This works but I still like the CR better. Guess there's a reason it costs $75.",3
"A bit intimidating in the bottle. It is blood red and has a thick consistency.  It looks like you smashed berries all over your face. Has no noticeable smell. The tingle is real but not uncomfortable at all. My face breaks out every month. I used this product as directed , ON DRY SKIN! It significantly helped with the current breakout. For the money it is worth it . So happy to have found a good product that is also not terribly priced! For a small bottle I know it will get lots of uses. A bit of this product goes a long,long way. I will definitely be using this product at least once per week.",2
"About 2 years ago I began to do my own nails. The price for gel/dip is ridiculous where I live and I could not find a manicurist that made it worth the price. So I went ahead and invested in great tools and products. I have tried various top coats by Deborah Lippman, INC Nails, Essie, etc. I can confidently say this is THE BEST. The others I feel no matter how long I waited to dry I would always wake up to see less of a glossy appearance and there would always be imprints/marks. I let my layers dry between each coat and really take every step for a professional manicured appearance, so that was frustrating to always have the top coat not perfect. Finally, a top coat that not only was good to go after only 20 minutes (I was afraid to wait any less) but I woke up today and they still look PERFECT. Truly like I went to the nail salon.",1
"about this. On one hand, I really like that it was made to apply with your fingers. Why it always shows brush application on Roen's website, I have no idea. Maybe to sell their brush. The purpleish color is a cream based product, while the others are powder. Can't find any explanation for that either. The colors are pretty and the purplish one is the one I end up using the most. The downside, at least for me, is these are super glittery. Not shimmer, not slightly glimmery, but chunky glitter that can migrate to different parts of your eyes and onto your face. They do look really pretty on and I have found they actually look better as they wear. I have also found they look better over a cream shadow, either shimmer or matte. They would probably look good over a powder shadow, but I haven't tried it as I have been using all products that can be applied with fingers lately. They don't seem to go on very nicely over bare lids or lids prepped with primer. It is hard to get an even application yet over another shadow, it seems to glide on. The glitter seems to migrate less when it is used over a cream shadow as well.  I do  make sure I do eyes first when using this in case I need to wipe off some errant glitter. I bought this during the sale, so I am happy about that. I would recommend it only if you know exactly what you are buying and I am not sure you get an accurate description here or on the Roen website. I do plan on continuing to use it.",3
"Absolutely amazing foundation. I have extremely oily skin, most foundations slide off or look terrible by the end of the day. this foundation looked like skin, light coverage and beautiful all day. Can never live without this foundation.",4
absolutely amazing product!!\ni am very very picky about scents being susceptible to strong smells due to migraines...this product DOES IS NOT SMELLY AT ALL as stated in some reviews it smells so amazing and is so luxurious!!  also i have read some that say it has... sparkles??? nope!! ZERO SPARKLES! just did a flashlight test with my husband! this is probably the best product i have used in 20 years! the small is to die for! the moisturizer itself has significantly improved my skins softness and reduced cellulite and scars ect. i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be blown away by this company and need some areas of your body corrected in my late 30s and i am sticking by this product 100%,2
Absolutely awesome! You get the mascara free so you can't go wrong! Love this eyelash curler! I highly recommend this if you curl your lashes as you won't be dissappointed. It's ergonomically universal!!,3
"Absolutely beautiful bronzer. I waffeled between purchasing this (Nars, Aucoin etc.) After testing the others while pretty..Hourglass won! Perfect for my fair skin all yearlong and looks great after I get a little sunshine. I find its perfect in Summer without blush during the day. I do apply Hourglass blush in the evening for a little more oomph. Great purchase, Fair price point considering the amount of product.  Whatever shade suits you Hourglass does not disappoint..",4
"Absolutely love it. It's one of the best cleansers ever and I've tried a lot. It cleanses deeply, but gently, removes all impurities and helps to heal/prevent acne and blemishes. It's a game changer for me. Gonna stick to it",4
Absolutely love these shadows!! Love Steel the Show!! I have green eyes and this color makes them pop! I love the texture its like silk!! Going to get a few more!! Thank you Taste and Sephora!! Please make more colors!!,3
Absolutely love this beauty! It’s such a great range of shades and the perfect size for travel! These are my personal favorite range of shades so I’m loving the color choices. The colors apply well and stay pigmented throughout the day.,0
"Absolutely love this eye cream. I have very dry, crepey under eyes and have tried numerous lower cost eye creams, serums, oils, etc. I keep coming back to this one because it works the best to combat the dryness.",2
Absolutely love this foundation! It is my go to foundation when I need to cover up acne or anything else going on with my skin. It is very lightweight and with the right primer and beauty blender you can make the foundation almost invisible on the skin.,0
Absolutely love this mascara when it’s paired with the Velvet Noir Primer! It makes your lashes look super long and adds a ton of volume. It looks like you have falsies without the hassel of the glue and worrying about them falling off.,0
"Absolutely love this masque. Got it as a substitute for the Salicylic acid... I wouldnt say there's a comparison? They both work well. However, the charcoal in this also gives you that charcoal cleansing effect.. which I personally love. Great gift for the price or even your own use! But then again, I love almost all 'The Ordinary' products as they are definitely worth their price.",1
"absolutely LOVE this palette. i have rosacea, so finding rosy tones that still compliment my skin tone can be difficult, but not with this one. absolutely in love. they are still really neutral, but have the perfect pop of color. the shadows are creamy and glide on beautifully. The palette itself is also impressive - structurally great with a beautiful and late mirror. highly recommend!",0
"Absolutely love this product!! Bravo to Smashbox!! This took my oh so dried lips back to normal in a night. Love the texture, it's not sticky if anything you can use it your cuticles! Love this magic potion!!",3
Absolutely love this roller. So much weightier and sturdy than some of the less expensive jade rollers I’ve tried. No squeaks on this one. I use it daily to help my products to penetrate the skin and for lymphatic massage. Really helps my jaw area which feels the stress from grinding my teeth. So anytime I need a little stress relief this roller really helps. Cool to the touch but the fridge intensifies the experience. Of course the color was the first thing to attract my attention.,3
"Absolutely love this set, I've tried a few things from Milk and really liked them so this was a perfect opportunity to really put them to the test. The price is not bad compared to what you get, with a full sized lip and check oil (which I'm obsessed with atm) and 6 mini products. The only thing that I'm not huge on is the highlight, I find it really sparkly but that's more of a personal preference. Overall really happy with this purchase",0
"Absolutely love this. The products are a nice size. Fair warning though, the toner stings. I only use it 2-3x/week. I found that's enough. Follow it up with the serum (it feels nice and bubbly on your skin) then the H20 moisturizer.",4
"Absolutely loving this palette! If your skintone is more on the fair side and you're not a fan of bolder looks, you might want to skip out because this palette. But I'm more into looks that are darker with several types of shimmers, and this palette delivers exactly that for me.",4
"Absolutely outstanding! The best lipstick I have ever used and the colours are beautiful. It goes on so smoothly and so pigmented and it's long-lasting and hydrating. Look no further, this beats Tom Ford, YSL, Chanel, MAC, etc.",1
Absolutely perfect for dry skin! I’ve tried so many products that don’t hold up all day long to combat my dry skin but this is absolutely perfect! I have sensitive dry skin and typically get breakouts if its too heavy but this is light and so refreshing for my skin!,0
"Absolutely perfect mascara for me. I have thin, short lashes and hooded eyelids. I also VERY dry, sensitive eyes, and have had my tear ducts plugged. The combination of these issues means that I'm looking for help with length and volume that won't rub off on my hooded lids, irritate my sensitive eyes, or get smudged off by my occasional leaky tears. This stuff is fantastic. It adds beautiful, natural looking length and volume that can be layered for your desired level of drama, and builds without ANY clumping. The brush delivers perfectly to both upper and lower lids with even and smooth coverage. It stays put like nothing I've ever used before, yet washes off when I want it to. I can trust that there won't be black smudges that I need to be fixing throughout my evening, even if I see a movie that makes me cry! I've never felt safe wearing lower lid mascara before this one, and now I do, because it's that's smooth and waterproof. Total game changer.",2
"A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that my skin was looking really good - smoother than usual and glowing.  Then I realized that I had been using this product for about 10 days. \nSo needless to say, I had zero expectations and this product delivered noticeable results - call me a convert!",3
"Admittedly, I moved down from really expensive eye creams (La Mer, La Prairie, Amore Pacific) to try and save some money, and I noticed my eyes looking worse with this product. I really appreciate that my eyes feels hydrated even after several hours, but the brightness around my eyes, dark circles and fine lines increased with this eye cream.",4
"Adorable packaging, but the moisturizer is just OK. You have to love banana scent bc it’s a little strong. The moisturizer is light and not oily so it would be good to try in the summer. This is not the moisturizer for an East Coast winter.",1
"Aether beauty is the best brand when it comes to eyeshadows that I’ve ever tried. They’re cruelty-free and only use organic, fair-trade ingredients, and there formula is top notch. I have all 4 of their palettes, but this one is my favorite. It’s VERY easy to use, blends effortlessly and lasts pretty much an entire day on my lids (about 7-8 hours without primer). Highly recommend!",0
"A forever repeat purchase! this moisturizer is in a word, luxurious. It lasts a really long time and has majorly changed my dry skin. I use it as a night cream as it is quite thick, but only a pea sized amount does the job! I'll buy it again and again",1
"A friend bought this and we used it while watching TV, and wow! My skin was super smooth and I like the results so much more than pricier products I own.\n\nSo I had to buy my own bottle and it's amazing price.",2
"A friend of mine recommended this face mask to me, saying it is her absolute favorite. However the first time I used it it made my face so red and made me break out more. I figured I'd try it again, but it hurt just as badly the second and third time around. I do have slightly sensitive skin, so I absolutely would not reccomend if you have that.",0
"After coveting this Diorskin Nude Luminizer Shimmering Glow Powder for the past few years, I finally got it in Pink Glow with a gift card. While it doesn't impart a blinding highlight, it still provides a very pretty and unique iridescent pink, glowy, sheen. Well worth the wait!\nPS I might ask for the 01 Nude Glow as a holiday gift! I've been admiring that shade for quite some time as well.",0
"After decades (yes, plural) of cutting all my cuticles and up the sides of the nail too, I decided to watch the Deborah Lippmann education video and buy the kit. \n\nAfter 3 weeks of using the kit (and the end of another Great Canadian Winter) I see a lot of improvement. I am now on the path to improving my nail health.",3
after eyeing this palette for a year I finally decided to purchase and it was surprising to see that natasha denona lives up to the hype! the perfect blend of cool and warm tones to create a variety of looks and finishes. you can truly create so much and you get so much product which is great for mua's love the versatility and buttery and pigmented formula. no fallout no problems. you will not regret this!,0
"After falling deeply in love with Farsali Skin Tune primer, I thought ""this is perfect, search over"". So I purchased 3 bottles of the magical stuff, cursing briefly at the price for the tiny bottle and the deeply annoying dropper that clogged damn near constantly. Fast forward to shortly after this Dior primer released. I kept finding myself checking out the reviews as I became more frustrated with Farsali's dropper system every morning. One reviewer spoke directly to me, I swear: ""if you love Skin Tune but the dropper drives you crazy, this is for you."" So I had to buy this primer...she said so lol. I placed my order, familiar with Sephora's return policy. I tried it and now I'm forever grateful to that reviewer! It really IS like my (former) HG primer...without the hassle and with an easier- to -stomach price tag.  There's a few slight differences: Dior has a slightly pink opalescent cream color to it while Farsali is opaque white. There's no discernable difference in consistency, both are a thick-ish fluid. The Dior is in a 50ml squeeze bottle while Skin Tune is in the aforementioned dropper bottle and houses 30ml. They both smooth over fine lines, wrinkles and pores like a dream. The effect lasts as long as my makeup is on too. I'm truly impressed by both primers. Here's why I'm going to repurchase the Dior from now on: 1) no contentious, irritating dropper to deal with at 5:15 a.m. 2) almost twice the near-identical formula for about $16 less dollars and 3) even though I've not tested the Dior one for as long of a period of time, the smoothing and texture-refining effects seemed just slightly more effective. For the amount you get of this high-end, very effective product, it's actually quite a bargain (& for Dior, it's almost garage sale pricing lol). I couldn't recommend more.",3
After finding this I will never use another brush cleaner again. It smells good but the fragrance doesnt stay in your brushes to irritate your skin/eyes later on. Cleans them so quick and easy and great if you only alternate between a few brushes and need a quick clean before using it again right away. GET THIS.,0
After hearing all the crazy about Brazillian Bum Bum cream I finally purchased my first jar a little over a month ago.  I recieved so many compliments from men (young and old) and decided to purchase another jar along with the spray.  The scent is AWESOME and the moisturizing is great.  I will not run out of this stuff... it is now a must have for me.  \n\nThe only reason why I'm giving it a 4 stars instead of 5 star is because the so called anti-cellulite and skin firming claims have not proven to be seen with my use.,3
After microneedling I was looking for something super hydrating as my skin which is normally oily became dry and had started peeling. This moisturizer was amazing kept my skin feeling so hydrated all day. Its become one of my favorites now and can't stop using it especially with winter coming up!,0
After MOH's surgery on my face the dermatologist recommended Aquaphor on the wound. That helped with the healing but I was told it would take 6 months for the scar to fade. I read some reviews of this serum and gave it a try. After only one week the scar was flatter and less red. Now after a month it is even flatter and has faded quite a bit. I just need a little concealer. I have a way to go but I am so happy I tried this product.,3
"After reading many of the reviews complaining that the color swatches of the Los Angeles shade weren't accurate to real life, and that it was more of a warm/brown nude instead of a beige pink, I knew this would be way more up my alley than I thought initially. I just love my warm brown/peachy nude shades and this one is no exception. Beautiful, creamy and comfortable formula from Bite, as always, but just be aware that this shade is not as it appears in the online swatch.",4
"After reading so many great reviews I purchased the smaller bottle to try this.  Who doesn't love a wonderfully scented face mist to give you a pick me up mid-day?  I can't figure out why people are raving about this...the scent was non-descript, almost none.  It wasn't even worth keeping, it's going back tomorrow!  Never again will I trust some of these reviewers, especially when there aren't that many!  It always makes me make a remorseful mistake making purchases.  Much better choices out there for less money!",2
"After reading the reviews I was super excited to try...needless to say it broke me out horribly,i wanted to cry, i have been having a goal to have super glass skin on my face by my birthday in December and this just took me 1000 steps back,will not be purchasing ever again.What works for some doesn't work for all.I still love Sephora thou",4
"After receiving a free sample of this, I’m obsessed and just had to order a full size tube! I have dry, very textured skin, and I’ve been struggling to find a facial cleanser that is cruelty free, doesn’t dry me out further and doesn’t smell like a perfume shop.",0
"After receiving a sample, I decided to give it a try. Wow, I am so pleased I did. I noticed that it balanced out the oil production, dehydrated & dry parts of my complexion. I used to have extremely oily acne prone skin & now I  have combination skin. I live in an arid climate, so this product is just what my skin needed. I take 2-3 drops, rub my hand together & gently press it onto my complexion after my moisturizer. I highly recommend this product.",3
"after six long weeks of the most acne I have ever had in my life, my skin is bright and glowing. each pimple that pops up now gets taken down in such a short amount of time thanks to these wipes. i dont worry about getting wrinkles as much when I feel how soft and refreshed my skin is. nothing replaces these... the redness I get sometimes is worth the benefits. wear sunscreen every day !!!",0
"After SR's Good Genes erased the little bumps on my face, I carefully moved on to A+ using the ""sandwich"" method, which means adding a thin layer of hydrating oil/moisturizer under and over the retinol. It's fantastic. I've used it for over a year now and it basically accelerates skin healing. Budding pimples, dull skin, it basically kicks my skin into action. I borrowed A+ to my mom (clear but thin skin, some wrinkles, spots from sun damage) and it evened out her hue and gave her an adorable ""plumped"" skin appearance. Love this and will continue to buy it again and again.",4
"After such great reviews, I really wanted to like this eye cream, and was VERY DISAPPOINTED. I gave it a full week of trial and error applying it morning and/or night with and without makeup, etc.\nI am over 40, and if you are in that age range, you need an eye cream that does more then brighten, but moisturizes and de-wrinkles, aka ""crepeyness"". If you are in your 20's or early 30's, moisture and wrinkles are likely not an issue for you just yet, (but brace yourself, it's coming!!), and this eye cream will perhaps make you happy with its brightening effects. But my 40  eyes were SO DRY when I used this, and after every use, I had to top with an additional eye cream to supplement the loss of moisture. ALSO, this eye cream DOES NOT BLEND WELL WITH CONCELALERS!! It piles and rolls and turned my makeup into a big mess. I looked 10 years older every time I wore this stuff. It was not pretty.\nI HIGHLY recommend the Shiseido wrinkle eye cream if you are dealing with dryness and wrinkles, cause this stuff does not address either. (*However, Shiseido just came out with an updated version of the eye cream, which I have not yet tried?) \nI did not notice a major effect in puffiness when using this either. If puffiness is your issue, use Clinique Eye bright.",2
"After trying (and not loving) the mineral sun cream by Supergoop!, I decided to give this a try. I. Love. It. The formulation reminds me of a Korean sun cream I loved, except this is half the price of that! I only wear mineral/physical sun creams, so I love that this has a velvety finish and minimal white cast. It layers very well and is easy to reapply over makeup. Definitely will be stocking up.",1
"After trying this mask at night a few times, I found its texture to be quite suitable for even more! In the afternoon, I use a tad less over my post-gym skincare routine. My cheekies go from hot, schweaty and flushed to clean, soft and happy.\n\nI received this product as a free sample.",4
"After two months of using this...the only thing that stops me from tossing this is using a moisturizer underneath it.  If I use this product on it's own followed by makeup, my concealer cracks badly. And by the end of the day my eyes feel seriously dried out. \nAlso, I dislike the cosmetic ""brightening"" aspect.",2
"After using the original version of this tinted moisturizer for over 10 years, I am devastated that Laura Mercier has replaced it with this new formula. I wanted to like it, but unfortunately it is nothing in comparison. I purchased my usual color, Blush, but the color is much darker than it was before and doesn't match my skin at all. It is also harder to work with –  the old version blended effortlessly into my skin, but I have to work a lot harder to get this to blend in, and it still tends to look patchy. It also has a strange smell that the original product never had. Thankfully I have some of the old version left, but when that is gone I’ll be looking elsewhere for a tinted moisturizer.",0
after using this 1 time tones of product clumps on brush and then gushes out of the top. I thought I got a bad batch so I exchanged it and the exact same thing happened. the girl at saphora said this has happened to alot of customers she has dealt with. I did try the mini and that one did the exact same thing.  definitely a waste of $$$,1
After using this product my skin feels and looks younger! I didnt really have noticeable wrinkles before but after using it I felt some how I my skin looked more youthful and healthy. It absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling oily and sticky. I let it sit for a minute before applying moisturizer and there is no chemical reaction using another product with it.,1
"After years of little to no breakouts, my skin started breaking out again. I tried a small sample of this product and noticed a difference on the size of the cystic pimples, immediately. Now, I use the oil every day and night along my jawline as a preventive measure.",3
"After years of searching, I have FINALLY found my Holy Grail foundation!! The color is perfect, the foundation applies smoothly and doesn't accentuate my pores or any fine lines. The finish is very natural in any lighting. This evens out my skin tone without looking masky or cakey...for me, this truly IS ""my skin but better ""!!",3
"A good basic eye cream without being too expensive. However, I wish i could find one that was just a bit more moisturizing and trust me I've tried several. Oh, well this is still pretty good but i'm still looking for the perfect one.",3
A great addition to the foundation. I believe the foundation is medium coverage and this powder is the perfect addition for the right coverage. Setting spray is a must or else transfer is guaranteed. Can be used alone for light coverage.,4
"A GREAT mask!! Leaves skin so refreshed, tightens pores, and hydrates, which most mud masks do not. A little goes a long way too!! Just got the large size so, Ill definitely be using it more ( moore) often! Its both hydrating and detoxifying!! like 2 masks in 1. And I do like my Glam Glow, but this is my holy grail mask! If I could only use 1, this would be it.",2
"A great set for the money with all my favorites. For essentially the cost of SuperMud, you get other products to try.   \nSuperMud is my go to as I have always had an issue with blackheads.  SuperMud is my holy Grail.  \nWARNING: if you have sensitive, be careful.  As it brings your blemishes up from the skin, you may also think it is causing breakout; but it's really clearing your skin.",4
a great substitute to the tarte drops I previously loved but with added bonus of spf. when applying the right amount it blends right in with foundation and doesn't take long to dry and set. gives just the right amount of sheen for that dewy look. I set with Becca's cooling translucent powder and works great.,1
"Agree with lots of reviewers. Does it taste good? No. No, it does not. It's the nastiest of the dusts, and the easiest way to deal with it is by covering it up with strong flavors like cloves or peppermint oil. Does it do what the label says? Yep. Yes it does. Middle-aged ladies should definitely consider this one if life is getting boring.",2
"ahhh I'm so glad I have this! I swatched it at Sephora and loved it but didn't buy it at the time. I'm so glad it was in the next big thing Sephora set! I'll probably only use them on my eyes or the highlighter on my cheeks for special occasions but this little duo makes me so so happy. I absolutely love glitter and these would make great shadow toppers. seriously in love, I have it swatched on my hand right now and can't stop staring at it. the glitters in the highlighter are fine and catch the light beautifully!! it will have fallout if you don't use glitter glue, which I personally don't mind!",0
"A+ lancome! i cannot go without this serum, its amazing ive seen a slight change in my wrinkles they are softening which maked me so happy! but it's making my face smoother, with a radiant look! it is priced high, i wish they would make smaller bottles. i love the packaging, but you have to be easy or it shots out of the applicator.",4
"A little DEFINITELY goes a long way with this product. It's nice for when yu want to look a bit more awake. However I can't say I've noticed any long term difference but to tell the truth I haven't used it consistently. It's a little thick and a bit difficult for me to get the right amount of product on my finger without going overboard or not putting enough and having to reapply. I will say that considering how little os needed, The Pearl will last a VERY long time. All things considered, I don't dislike it, but I wouldn't purchase it again once I am finished.",0
"A little goes a long way with this foundation. The foundation sets matte but has a satin look almost. I have combination skin and with this foundation I don't need to set it. love it, works great for me and gives me a good medium to full coverage.",4
"a little goes a long way with this product. Helps keeps skin moisturize and keeps makeup in place. However, if your like me and not big into makeup products with fragrance. The smell can be overwhelming.",1
"A little smaller than I thought, but great for travel! I feel like this blush tone works for almost any look, so having the shimmer and matte option work perfect if you are trying to pack light. Gives a natural flush, and is easy to build-up to desired pigment.",0
"All 3 products work well. Photo finishing particularly! Once you get this, you will see what i mean. Simply give it a try, or give it as a xmas gift. Your friend will love it. There are many other brands, none of them is as good as Smashbox.",4
"All of these pull SO red. Despite Rosewood being the second lightest, it belonged to someone wanting a different bronzed look than I. I think Saddle is an appropriate match for me, but I didn't much like the formula either.",0
Alright I'm going to sound corny probably but this is one of my favorite concealers I've ever had! It's by far my favorite product from this line. super creamy formula that blends out amazing I dont have to sit there blending for hours(if you catch my drift) last all day and I'm a girl who works 9-5. Wont crease as long as you set it and has minimal oil that breaks through. also it's not super cakey so I really appreciate that my skin still feels like it can breath. only down fall I can find it you get .19 fl.oz of product....,1
"Although I am a little tired of Mascara being the go to when it seems another sample is needed, it could be worse, Sephora could be sending a makeup brush,  which I am thankful Sephora does not waste my money on. This mascara is decent, not as good as some in the past, but at least I am finding out what brands I like and don't like so that I never pay full price to find out.",4
"Although I try other primers every year or so, Instant Smooth is what I always come back to. As the name suggests, it goes smoothly on the skin, moisturizing and preparing skin for make up. I've tried lot of others but nothing is better and few come even close.",4
"Although the color is great, I absolutely hate the tip on this product. It doesn't allow for very precise application, especially for cat-eye. Not sharp enough and for some reason very soft and dries out too fast. Maybe it's just a matter of personal preference, but I sure won't be buying again. Wouldn't recommend either!",1
"Although the shade was a little light for me, once I blended it out and added of the rest of my makeup it looked flawless. This foundation is truly traceless a blends in seamlessly with your skin and lasts all day. The finish leaves this beautiful natural skin glowy look.  It's honestly an amazing foundation  And I highly recommended if you could afford the price tag, or if you're in the mood to splurge.",4
"Always thrilled to see new Bite product. Glitter, even shimmer is not my thing, but had to take a shot on Violet Icing. Quite different than the photos look to me. Can be applied in light thin sheer layers alone or over lipstick such as neutral-ish Pastille vastly improved by the cooling from a sheer layer of this. Shimmer is subtle and beautiful. I actually love it. Just bought another Violet. May try Grape. Purple shades not often available at Sephora for some reason, necessary neutral for my skintone!",2
"Always wanted to try Artis brushes, but was waiting for them to do a limited edition version in pink or rose gold (fyi, these perfectly match my rose gold simplehuman sensor mirror), so I ordered this set directly from Artis as soon as they came out. \n\nUnlike the knock off versions offered by other companies, these brushes are top quality with thick, even bristles and metal handles that give them a nice heft when applying product. If you're older or suffer from dexterity problems, these brushes might be a great option for applying BB cream, concealer and a little cream blush to your face.\n\nIMO, the Artis brush design is ideal for applying base makeup, so the brushes in this set are the ones I would recommend to anyone who wants to try them. All and all, I'm very pleased with the set, but wish they had included a 1R for spot concealing.",3
"AMAAAAAZING. I've tried many,and I mean MANY primers for my skin which is oily in my t zone but dry on other areas. Most primer tend to break me out and not work with my skin making it slosh around and the oils will seep through within an hour. I was skeptical on the primer due to the consistency of it,but I'm truly blown away! I'm trying to convert to clean makeup,which this is my first step\n So far I'm highly impressed at how matte,but healthy/glowy my skin looks with this primer under my makeup. I've never received compliments on my skin/face makeup until I wore this. It is truly everything I could hope it would be and I recommend this to the fullest!",4
Amazed at how well this works! I have large pores and combo/oily skin that can be sensitive and this REALLY CLEANS YOUR PORES!! It definitely does bring up the blackheads though so first couple uses I had to squeeze some out gently and actually followed up with a biore pore strip on my nose and I swear after 2 uses my blackheads were almost gone. Truly impressive mask! I rub it on and rub it off during rinsing and haven't gotten red or irritated either. I only use it 1-2 times a week but seriously best pore/blackhead mask i've ever used and its well priced.,0
Amazing. Been using for a week and they have kept my skin clear and are fading my acne scars. I copied what another person did by using these on the bikini line and OMG no more razor bumps or ingrown hairs! AMAZING.,0
"Amazing. Bought this for my daughter who was out of another brand, which was not available.  Since using this cream, she reports her acne  has significantly improved. She wants to permanently switch.  well worth the money.",3
amazing coverage! especially for feeling so light-weight on the face. I am very surprised by the bad reviews for this foundation. I wonder if people are using too much product. you do not need a lot of product at all and you still get crazy good coverage. I can even use without concealer and I have very dark circles under my eyes. I recommend using fingers to apply and waiting a couple of minutes for the foundation to dry before adding any other product or setting with powder. I use the hourglass primer serum and setting powder. also it is hard for me to find a match for my skin tone and natural Amber blends perfectly!,4
Amazing for brightening eyes but I felt the blue in my skin under my eyes wasn’t quite neutralized. Eyes shouldn’t be dry otherwise fine lines show quite a bit.  Like the feel of the product however the container it comes in gets very messy if it gets jostled at all. Don’t put it in your purse or carry on!,3
amazing for dry skin :) \n\nI have normal skin after I do skincare and prime. \nI prime with the farsali glass skin and porefessional. \nI also use the laura mercier concealer. \nAll together it looks so beautiful like it's my own skin minus the redness. it also covers my acne and eczema well when I use a powder over the top. I use the charlotte tilbury pressed powder and the hourglass powder  :) \n\nif I want full coverage I layer it once more to cover my freckles. \nI purchased the ABH luminous foundation at the same time and this one takes #1 for sure!,0
"Amazing! Goes on light and creamy, moistirizes well and doesn't make me oily later in the day. It is a perfect base for make-up if you let it soak in, or mix it in with your primer( that's what I do). I also reapply later in day, and I don't get weird build up. My skin is also acne prone around my jaw, and this seems to help.",1
"Amazing! I bought this to hydrate my skin during the harsh, dry winter. It works great for hydration but within a few days I also noticed another amazing result...it helped to reduce the bags under my eyes. I have horrible bags that no product can get rid of...they are unfortunately hereditary. I have already done the CO2 laser treatment (they were that bad) and since the results of that has worn off over the years, no product since has helped.  I will continue to buy products from this line for sure! I wish I had a before an after pic! Just be careful while using around the hairline as my hair tended to look greasier faster due to it picking up the oil from my face.",4
"AMAZING - if you use it CORRECTLY. I have very sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try this. I had lots of acne, scars, milia, closed comedones, you name it. I've been through a lot of products to try and get clearer skin. I started with Stridex and used it for a long time with little luck. I then tried Differin (0.1%) for a month or two which helped more but still not enough. I tried various other products as well but those are the mains. My point is, I built my skin's acid exfoliant tolerance up before using this, which is clearly a must. Almost everything irritates and burns my skin, everything I use is made specifically for sensitive skin. I started out with this once every 3 days for the whole 10 minutes and noticed it was too harsh (orange peel texture, sensitive). I stopped using it for a week and moisturized plenty and treated my skin like a baby and it went back to normal. I now have been using it every 4 days (nothing in between but a sensitive wash and plenty of moisturizer). I had horrific scarring from previous nodular acne that was on my face for at least 2 years, very very dark red purple spots. After less than a month of using this they're about half lighter, when nothing else even budged them. My skin is much clearer and less red. Even my milia I've had for 3+ years is beginning to go away. I don't write many reviews but I saw a lot of negative ones about this being too harsh and throwing it out. It definitely can be, but I promise if you work your way up to it and be careful, just find the correct space of time between uses, it will work absolute wonders. Keep in mind it's a very strong acid and needs to be used with extreme caution when using it at home. Thanks to this I can leave the house without makeup now.",0
"Amazing, I love this set! Makes a great stocking stuffer as well. My only qualm is that the lip balm is very fragile, I have broke it both times I bought this set. Maybe having it in different packaging would be great.",0
"Amazing!! I recieved this product in one of my monthly subscription boxes. My skin is combination oily, a bit sensitive, textured, and it drank this product up. There was so much serum in the package I saved it and have been using it nightly after cleansing my face (for the past 5 days now). Overall the texture of my skin has improved and is much brighter and smoother.",2
"Amazing moisturizer! I have oily/ sensitive skin and this product does not break me out or cause any irritation. In fact its helps irritated  skin. I wanted to try origins products and  I ended up with rashes on my face, went back to aqua bomb and in 2 days my skin was normal again. awesome product.",4
"amazing quality and amazing price! I find it hard to use every brush in a set, which is why I never buy them, but I truly use all of these brushes. I think the quality is great, especially for the price; you're paying less than $13 CAD a brush. Definitely recommend if you can get your hands on them!",0
Amazing. Recieved two days ago and have used it 3 times. Already a noticeable chamge in the appearance of my skin. Kind of annoyed that I have to use an app to use it. Did not want to connect a few times and disconnected a few times while using it but other than that great. I bought it when it had the tarte skin with it and its doing a good job.,1
Amazing serum!  I've been using this about 3 weeks now and can definitely see improvement in my skin.  The fine libes are much less noticeable and the texture is definitely smoother.  It does go on a little thick and sticky but absorbs quickly and makeup glides right over it.  This is a GREAT high end skin care product.,4
"Amazing set that can be handed out individually for gifting or you can be selfish like me and keep it all to yourself! the containers are full size which is worth the money, as each mask can be up to $80. During the coarse of the week, my pores and blemishes have diminished, my skin looks supple and brighter, even skin tone and overall looks like I slept 40 hrs a week. I definitely recommend because a little product goes a long way and this will last for atleast half a year! I would not recommend for younger skin. More so the age of 25+",1
"AMAZING SMELL. it honestly puts me in a better mood when I smell it. I bought a bunch of other products from YTTP because of how much i loved this cleanser. it is gentle, calming, and perfect for winter as it does not strip the skin at all. I've been using the overnight sleep mask and this cleanser is perfect for washing my face in the morning so I can take off an excess mask residue. my face is supple and ready for skincare and makeup.  since it doesnt produce much of a lather I cant see myself using this at night, but it's a favorite for the morning for sure!",4
"Amazing! The reviews did not disappoint.  I waited for the coupon, I got lucky that it didn't sell out since it's a limited edition. Its huge. I got deep. I'm a dark chocolate brown complexion. I'm so pleased. with this purchase.  The packaging is hard sturdy plastic with a huge mirror. Its definitely a make up artist size but little ol me will be using it for ""me"".",4
"amazing!! this cream does everything it says in the description. I got the small size of this and a little seems to go a long way. super soft, luminous, moisturizing, just amazing. It is pricey but if this works wonders I will continue to buy because it is nothing compared to all the money I've spent on useless products that ended up in the trash. this is a great investment in my opinion. la mer met up to it's hype and wowed me at first use. did not irritated my acne prone skin, it in fact made my scars look more blurred out.",0
Amazing! This is so soothing and moisturizing on my skin without a greasy feel. It adorbs quickly and I have seen a huge reduction in the redness and blemishes. I use this morning and night. I have super sensitive skin as well and this did not anger my skin at all. I recommend this to everyone!,4
"Amazing value considering that the price of the Liquid Collagen alone is $120. I wanted to the Sleeping Collagen, I already know and love the Genius Cream, and I also wanted to try the eye cream. I love all of them. Algenist never disappoints me!",4
"Amazing value! You get a full size of the H20 face cream, a travel size of the treatment and a travel size of the serum. You're saving about $39. can't complain. I love the face cream I've gone back to it so many times. It's a light gel moisturizer that feels so refreshing. I haven't tried the treatment yet. I tried the  serum last night. It gave my skin a nice boost of moisture. I was just going to buy the face cream but for $9 more why not get some extra goodies that would be $24 each? Definately recommend as a gift to you or someone else",4
"Amazing variety of colors! I love that they offer different finishes! I'm not a huge fan of lipsticks, but I would wear these from time to time. They're very pigmented and wear pretty well, for a lipstick.",2
A minimalist’s dream come true. The packaging is STUNNING. I wish they made everything else identical to this all white packaging like their foundation stick. I love the magnetic enclosure. It’s weighty so it feels luxe too.  The packaging caught my eye but the product itself is great. I own both c.r.e.a.m. and skillz. They are both moisturizing and pigmented. The cream is a very flattering nude on me. I will definitely repurchase! Fave lipsticks by far. I don’t normally pick up lipsticks because I don’t like the way they smell but these don’t bother me at all.,1
"An amazing product! Definitely recommend. My skin looks amazing, and the price is reasonable because it works. I have Lupus, oily combination skin, dark spots and prone to acne. My dark spots, acne, and even the little texture I had (due to lupus), began to fade away in days, maybe a little over a week. Gonna be a staple in my skin care collection.",2
"A nice fine line that, with small light strokes, looks like you own hairs on your brow.  When i opened is up however, a part of the tip broke when i made first application and about a quarter of it was wasted.",3
"An ok concealer. Shade was not ideal for me, so I would hope for more undertones. Also, it does crease for sure. Coverage is quite natural if that is what you are looking for but I prefered shape tape. On the bright side it feels more light and hydrating.",4
"Another disappointment from La Mer.  As I have stated in other reviews, they should stick to their signature lotions/creams because they are amazing.  This is no better than any drugstore toner I have used.  It is not hydrating, despite its claims to be.  I used it for a week and just couldn't get over how not impressive it was.  Even the packaging was not good ... the hole at the top is so tiny barely anything came out.  I had to make it larger with a safety pin just to get the liquid to come out more than one tiny drop at a time.  There is absolutely nothing about this product that justifies the price.  Nothing.  I will stick with May Coop Raw Sauce or SK-II.",2
"Another genius packaging idea from DRUNK ELEPHANT. A measured pump on the jar, means the right amount and the bonus of keeping dirty fingers and bacteria out of the container. Easily absorbed, this soft souffléd night cream hydrates, calms, and moisturizes face, but with no greasy residue! A lovely evening cream especially when layered with their other products! Love the clean white jar with the Lavender lid that complements the other color coded products in the line. Wish it had an SPF as it would also make a nice day cream!",3
Another HG product. I got this yesterday and I'm already seeing a huge difference. I used this after the Ordinary acid peel.\nSmall white heads and blackheads are gone. Redness is gone. Even my acne scars look smaller.,1
"Another midnight purchase gone right. The Smashbox lip color is very matte, not really for me. The stand out here is the Sol de Janeiro Coco Cabana Cream, it smells divine, like an entire coconut cookie factory and it's a great cream. However, it is NOT for sensitive skin. Tread lightly. The under eye cream is of the tightening variety, so not for older skin. The packaging is a pop up pot. The setting powder is very finely milled, so use sparingly. Very reminiscent of Hourglass Veil, so that's a win.",3
"Another PML, like all of her other products a small amount goes a very long way.  If you do not let your moisturizer set and apply any primer right away, it could cause pilling.  Give your moisturizer and this primer time to set, just a minute in between and you will be happy.  If you use a heavier moisturizer, more time maybe required.  You don't want to look like a greasy mess or have your primer/foundation separating. Yes the packaging isn't as high end as most of her other packaging now, but if you remember her first products which focused on quality rather than packaging.  This is one of those cases.",3
"Another product that's not for me. I don't know what it is with these skincare products that's hyped on here. I always have some type of reaction. I got this as a sample from my last order. I decided to try it. it didn't feel right going on. After about a hour, my face just started burning. I had to wash it off right away. Not good for people with sensitive skin.",4
"Another purchase simply to have on the go when I need a little something. I have light skin and no problem getting a natural looking glow from all the products in this palette. This is not for a glam look at all, I use it more for a no makeup look when I'm not needing much more than a pick me up!",4
"Anti-Precision is a good description for this product - after a few uses, the extra chubby tip means that you will have to use this in tandem with a different product to get a nice winged line. I did try angling my use to maintain a bit of an angled tip but unfortunately that didn't work well. It has good staying power and it's a nice non-ashy black, but it's not for me. Not great if you like thin lines or a winged liner effect and want to use only one product.",4
"anytime I see a bunch of 5 star reviews on a product I am some what skeptical, but I decided to give this a try. I'm glad I did! this stuff isnt your ordinary lip gloss. it's more like a shimmery lip balm. it perfectly hydrates your lips and the shimmer isnt overbearing which I LOVE! give this a try and believe the hype",1
"A one and done and then some... this little trio is extremely handy. I use it not only as an eyeshadow but as an undereye concealer, eyeliner, eyebrow powder and I even dip into the light brown to use as a contour. The dark brown I can get almost black when applied wet so it makes a great liner. Very pigmented, long lasting formula. They blend out easily and beautifully! So tiny, simple and versatile.",2
"Appears to reduce hyperpigmentation, used during day in conjunction with The Ordinary's B5 + Hyaluronic acid. Does have a bit of an oiler consistency, but I only use one drop so it absorbs. I apply foundation on top and have not had issues.",4
"Applied carefully, this stuff is gorgeous, with a natural satin finish, and it lasts all day. I use a quarter of a pump (at most), dot it onto the skin working in small sections, and then really buff it in using a MAC 170 brush. I also don't use a primer underneath - just my normal skincare topped with a moisturizer. \n\nI usually go for light or medium coverage with more of a glowing finish, but wanted something more long-wearing that would last a full work day and into the evening. This is very pigmented, but I find I can mimic the look of my lighter coverage foundations by using a very small amount and then upping the glow with a cream highlighter. The big difference is the look lasts all day verses disappearing in 4-5 hours.",2
"Apply it like a moisturizer and let it sink in all night long. It is lightweight, creamy, and hydrating on my skin. Key ingredients that assist with healing and soothing are arnica flower, calendula, centella asiatica,",1
A really beautiful blushing highlight. I go very very lite bc a little goes a long way. It is and can be very intense but the product is so silky smooth and blendable that I'm able to achieve an almost natural glow. I'm very happy with my purchase and just ordered alba as well. These are going to last me a very very long time.,4
"Are these shadows pretty? sure. is the price good? yeah. what bothers me is this is the EXACT same palette they released for black Friday last year which I also purchased. I swatched the shades next to each other and they're the same. yes I like this palette since I liked last year's, but I'm disappointed that this isn't new at all. I'd only recommend if you didn't have last year's palette. it's also best to apply with your fingers and has some fallout.",4
"Arlene's Nude is such a beautiful, unique color, but the overwhelming amount of fragrance in this makes it unbearable to wear. Fragrance normally doesn't bother me, but this is so loaded with perfume that it makes food taste flowery when you're wearing it.",0
"arrgh! so mad! I bought this yesterday in store and I opened the box this morning to put on my wrist and nothing came out, I pressed harder and still nothing. this has no product in it!!! Off to the store I go again today to exchange it. I tried a sample of this fragrance a month ago and it has a long staying power on me and I truly love the scent. hopefully the one I replace will have product in it.",2
"As a big fan of a multilayer beauty roitine this is my step 5 in am daily skin routine (duo cleans), toner or mist, essence, Essential Creme Fluid, then AP eye gel, AP moisturizer.... is it pricey, yes, is it worth it, yes. Invest in your skin, you'll be glad you did!!",3
"As a contact lens wearer who loves the look of tightlining but is forever wary of it, I was thrilled to see a product that would take the worry out of the process. Unfortunately, this primerlinerscara does nothing it promises. I curled my lashes, then wiggled this firmly along the baseline before applying as normal. Nothing. I tried a second coat. Still nothing besides taking the curl out of my lashes. It went back to the store the next day.",1
"As a fan of ""Sunday Riley"" I would not purchase this again .... I will stick with brand on other products but as far as a vitamin c serum this just is not the one I would suggest or use again due to many other awesome working ones on the market .",0
"As a flight attendant with mostly dry skin, this has been incredible. I've been using it in the morning and evenings and it has left my skin feeling hydrated and soft. Other moisturizers feel good for the moment and before I'm even done my makeup I can feel my skin feeling thirsty. The gel lotion goes on smoothly and my skin just sucks it up. It feels light weight and absorbs nicely. I've heard of IT Cosmetics before but this was the first time i've tried their products. I would definitely buy this again and I would recommend it. I also love that it travels easily--I've had mishaps with twist on lids opening up or not fully being closed (I have some 4am starts) but this one dispenses easily and I don't have to worry about it exploding in my beg. Get yourself one!",0
"As a foundation this did nothing for me. The shade match was dead on. The ingredients are clean.. Skincare in makeup. It goes on perfectly giving sheer coverage, blurring and evening my complexion. No greasy feeling, didn't feel like I had anything on. Half hour later it's gone. (maybe I need a warmer shade.) It disappears, with and without setting powders and sprays. In a pinch, rushing out the door one day, I couldn't find my concealer so I reached for True Skin Serum Foundation to conceal and highlight. This baby covered my bags, dark under-eye shadow and brightened like a dream! It does the job without it looking like anything but healthy glowy youthful skin. This formula is everything I wanted in a highlighter and concealer... And it's got nourishing ingredients. I received this as a sample to review and I will definitely go swatching for a darker shade as a foundation. But for now I have happily found my holy grail dewy, stay put, non cakey concealer and natural brightener, totally by accident! Will def purchase.",3
"as a gloss it's nice - office appropriate shine and easy to wear. The coffee thing is fine - I didn't find it overwhelming one way or other. Dirty Chai is an excellent neutral shade.\nHowever the packaging sucks. It does not close well and multiple times I jave found this leaking on my desk, and after the first time I think I've been pretty careful. No way would I toss it in a purse. defeats the purpose cause I want to have gloss with me for ongoing applications. Not a repeat buy",3
As a newbie to Drunk Elephant I expected more from this. It dried me out really bad and made my face get patchy I dont know how to explain it. It gave me like a weird texture like dry and scratchy. I also didn’t like the container it came in...I think it could’ve been different but that’s just me. I didn’t break out with it and my skin is pretty sensitive but don’t like that it sucked all the moisture instead of giving me more. I dont know if I would recommend. I guess it depends on the persons skin type and preference. It just didn’t work for me.,2
As a new mom I don’t have much time for myself.  I love this treatment only takes 3 minutes! I haven’t experienced any irritation and I’ve felt a mild tingle but no pain. My skin feels tighter and smoother after use. Although I think it’s too soon to say it’s working miracles I do feel like it’s working. I’m buying more serum to continue using it and can’t wait to see long term results.,1
"As a new mom, I’m looking for anything that will help me look human throughout the day, and this kit did just that! The translucent powder is already inside a little puff which makes for an easy application throughout the day and the eye masks really do help with under circles! My only complaint is the with the color of the lip treatment; while the gloss goes on smooth and feels great, it’s a bit too brown for me. However, that is just my preference.",0
"As a Researcher of 40 years, 20  working,writing,researching skincare/cosmetics, I don't understand the low ratings and comments.  \n.  ""Peach Puff"" is a long lasting formula.  \n.  It does deliver the right amount of product on the ""puff"".  \n.  The formula is light and not heavy like so many products.\n.  It does ""resist"" feathering and bleeding. \n\nMy skin tone is on the lighter side of light-medium.  I purchased BOY BYE and absolutely love it.           \n.  It's a beautiful color",2
"As a serum for hydration it works well, my skin felt smooth. But for spots treatment, which is what it claims to do, didn't work at all. Zero difference and I used 2 bottles every day am and pm with their exfoliating soap from the same line. Big disappointment!",4
"A sephora employee recommended this to me because she saw the redness on my face.  I have sensitive skin that gets dry and seriously this stuff stops the red and keeps my skin hydrated.  Its pricier than other things I've used, but it works and if you have skin redness you might want to give it a shot.",2
As far as eyeshadows go this wasn't bad but I was expecting a different consistency. I guess bouncy could be interpreted a couple of ways but this eyeshadow was downright dry and the application was not as smooth as I was expecting.,0
"Asian skin, 30 , severe atrophic scars in the T area. \nLet's be honest here pitted acne scars are to stay for life even with more invasive treatment   filler/laser. What the product does is to blur its appearance when wearing it, which seems to be working for me. Can't speak of its long term effect at this time but then again there are many variables and no single product can cure it.",0
"A simple soap, no bells and whistles.  I like the mild formula, sometimes it is nice to have a product that does just one thing - clean your skin - and does it well, without trying to throw in extra ingredients that end up irritating.  I like that I can lather this on my face and not worry about my eyes (though, obviously, you'll want to avoid getting it in your eyes, but if you do it won't sting).  If you're looking for a simple soap that cleans well and is not irritating, you won't find anything better!",2
"As much as I wanted to,  I just did not like this at all! I used with primer & without. Tried different brushes & techniques to no avail. The shadows were muddy & didn't blend well into each other. I can't explain but this palette just wasn't workable in any way. Powdery too which isn't that big a deal if they worked properly but they just didn't preform well. Returning as soon as I'm able to get to the store 45 minutes away from me.",3
"As much as I wanted to love this product unfortunately couldn't. It's still a great moisturizer, clean, very beautifully packaged and comes with a magnetic spatula (excellent). However, I wouldn't recommend it for dry skin, I have fairly dry skin and it's just not hydrating enough for me, I'm left with dry patches and tightening. For someone with combination of perhaps oily skin it'll work great.",4
"As noted in a couple other reviews, there is an odd and permeating odor to this product. I used for two weeks and then had to discontinue because I couldn’t tolerate the odor — something in the gel evaporated up in my nose like fumes.",2
"As others have stated the product is tiny, like TINY. I however love the lip balm. It feels great, tastes great, and keeps my lips super soft. I definely plan on purchasing it in full size. If you arent interested in brown/mauve lipstick, then Sex On the Peach isnt for you.",4
"As someone that suffers from sensitivities to practically everything, I can safely say that this cream is my Savior. Not only do I not react to it badly, it's soothing to the skin around my eyes. I've never had a cream that I could put even near my eyes without reacting badly. \n\nAs for the de-puffing agent, it works very well. My eyelids tend to swell on occasion, but they're doing it less frequently after using this cream for over 3 weeks now. I don't have under eye bags, so I can't attest to that. \n\nThe age-defy agent will take much longer to determine the effectiveness, but at least now I HAVE a cream for the skin around my eyes. That alone will help tenfold.",4
"as someone who has combination skin with dry, peeling checks and rosacea, this is a good cleanser. I do like how makeup melts off. however, the cleanser gets stuck when I am washing off sunscreen. The nose area gets ""stuck"", even when I emulsify with water.  on days where I wear sunscreen, a double cleanse with a makeup removal balm or oil will be needed.",3
"As someone who is very pale the foundation range for different undertones was great. I was matched by someone in the store and this shade was a perfect match. Because I'm so pale though, I really had to work to add some color back to my face. Because this foundation is so full coverage I almost looked ghostly because of how pale I am. Overall really nice and definitely wears well. But it does like to separate into water and the product if you let it sit so shake well before use.",0
"As someone with redness/roseaca I wanted to love this product.  It did seem to help with the redness however, I ended up with itchy breakouts where I applied it.  It is probably due to my sensitive skin so be careful if considering this if you are the same.",2
"As someone with very dry cheeks, cystic acne, and an oily t-zone, this product was a true lifesaver. My skin is truly all over the map and this product was able to provide moisture to areas that needed it, was not overly heavy where I am oily, and significantly reduce the amount of breakouts and cystic acne I have. I did need to use a lot of product each morning (about 3-4 pumps) so I went through it quickly and it has a really unappealing smell (kind of like plastic garbage bags). This all said, the product worked miracles on my skin and I can't wait for Sephora to re-stock so I can repurchase.",0
"As soon as I opened this up I knew I was gonna love it. The packaging is simple but very nice, I loved how it’s an ombré gradient - looks great on my nightstand (; the cream itself is very lightweight and weightless. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and didn’t leave it sticky at all. It just feels like my skin took a hydrating sip of water! Didn’t make my sensitive skin break out or anything. I’m seriously considering buying a bigger bottle because I love it so much! \n* I received this product for free for testing purposes.",0
"As soon as I saw this lot I fell in love and needed it, but once I got it I am a little bit underwhelmed.. I am very pale and the lightest shade looks very weird on my skin tone. I can make it work with lip liner and stuff but the lightest shade and the peach shade are just a little bit too light and look like concealer lips.. the darkest shade though I really like and I can mix it with the lightest shade and it is actually really beautiful. The metallic shade I don't think I would ever wear ... Just too 90s frosty.. the gloss is nice I think it would look great as a topper. All in all I say eh I wouldn't buy it again.. just stick to the single lipsticks but it's not horrible. I received this lot complimentary from influensters for reviews",0
"As you can see from the five stars that this item already has, this review doesn't even need to be written. But if you are new to the brand or are looking at this palette, let me say, since I have delved into the world that is Pat McGrath eyeshadow, I can tell you I understand now why it is such a cult favorite for makeup lovers and especially for high-end or luxury makeup lovers. Is the prize extremely high for her items? Yes. Is $125 US dollars too much for eye shadow palettes? I would say yes. at the end of the day we are just talking about eyeshadow. However, now that I have purchased Mothership palettes it will actually save me money because I will no longer buy 3-4 other ""lackluster"" palettes that can be hit or miss. If you're on the fence... JUST TAKE THE PLUNGE AND TRY IT! Her Astral shades are what will pull you in (the FOUR ""special shades"" at the end of her palettes). Layer them on top of another color and it is truly amazing how it will change your eye look COMPLETELY yet BEAUTIFULLY! Beware because you will get so many compliments...mark my words! I have six of her palettes (and I am on pins and needles waiting and anticipating the ""surprise"" US release of the Mothership 7 palette, a palette we didn't even know was coming!) and I would not part with a single one. Mothership 3, Mothership 5, Subversive Metalmorphosis, Blitz Astral Quad Ritualistic Rose, Mini Sublime, Mini Subversive... and hopefully soon to be the owner of Mothership 7, because it's right up my alley! Like I said, if you're on the fence, JUST TRY IT, YOU'LL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! <3",2
"At 26 fine lines are just starting to become an issue, while combination skin and rough patches are an ongoing problem. I'm a huge fan of PTR and this serum is no exception. I usually have a purging period with retinoids but this just seemed to instantly work. My texture noticeably improved after a few uses - I do use a Clarisonic, but this helped with the lines forming around my eyes and temples and definitely smoothed my dry patches. My skin also looks brighter. This will definitely remain in my routine!",3
"At 52 some skincare has that wow effect but sometimes it only happens the first few times I use it. It's the products that continue to give my skin the smooth glowing appearance I'm going for, until the product is gone, that I give 5 stars to. I was going to use this one longer before I reviewed because I have those experiences but I really think this retinol might be a game changer for my skin, that's why I don't want to wait to share the results of the youthful appearance it is revealing. Make sure you start off slow if you try it. Once the first week or two then maybe twice then go from there.",3
"At first glance and try, it feels like any ordinary concealer but, at the end of the day, I did notice my pimple size was smaller and less irritated. It has a creamy consistency and is easily blendable. the only reason why I knocked off one star was because it didn't seem like a full coverage concealer but, it wasn't bad and I would purchase once I run out.",4
At first I loved this primer.  I ordered 2 backups since it had sold out. Keep away from under your eyes or anywhere near.  I started experiencing my mascara flaking off during the day. Really horribly actually. I thought it was the mascaras,3
"At first it didnt work that well, but after I learn little tricks from korean makeup artists this product became a super star. \n1)after skin care and sunscreen let the products absorb for about 5 min before applying makeup\n2)use about 1 drop (essential enough to have a thin layer to cover ur face)layering helps the makeup not cake and build up coverage without looking heavy \n3) be gentle when applying makeup",0
"At first I thought this would be my new favourite mascara, it went on well and my lashes looked full yet natural. At the end of a hot and busy day I noticed it was all smugged and melted and gave me racoon eyes. I was so disappointed, straight to the trash the sample went...",4
"At first, I used an entire tube with just minimal results.  THEN....I figured out you make it the FIRST thing you put on your eye.  I was putting it on last at night, but as soon as I starting putting it on before any of my other eye products....WOW!  I had some decent length before, but could never get my lashes to curl.  I used so, so many eyelash curlers, but as soon as I put any mascara, they would straighten right out again.  :/  So now my lashes are so long they hit the inside of my glasses and they curl!!!  :D  Totally worth every penny!\n\nAlso, my mom used it and she had NO eyelashes, but now she's got beautiful, lashy-lashes, too!  :D",3
"At first I was hesitant to use a foundation that had a natural, radiant finish because I have oily skin and was concerned that I was look like an even oiler mess. Surprisingly I really loved how this foundation looked like when first applied and even working an 8 hour shift everything still looked good! I may become a little oily throughout the day but it looks more like a nice dewy finish rather than completely fall apart oil slick. The foundation is a medium to full coverage and also feels very light weight. As long as you prep your skin right, you don't have to worry about looking cakey. Will for sure make a purchase of this foundation when the bank account lookin right lol",0
"At first, I was so impressed, with how great this looked over a mattifying primer. Peaches and cream, for Summer make up looks. ALAS! THERE ARE CHEMICAL SUNSCREENS!! This breaks my heart, as this looked the prettiest on my face! Why can't E.L. let people add their own sunscreens? More of us could enjoy this beautiful make up, if not made with SPF.",4
At first I was worried that this product would have a lemon scent since i don’t do well with scented products but this is completely scentless so that’s a huge plus for me! My skin is also very sensitive to everything but this product did not break me it. It left my skin soft and dewy!,0
"At first, Rose Blazer 89 is a soft, pretty pink.  However, it changed to bright fuchsia and sometimes red (which I love!) at random in the 3 days I used it. Great feel, softened my lips, but the color change is odd. This shade isn't for me.",4
"A tiny amount is all that is required for your face. Perfect finish, total moisture. If you want light moisture, this is not for you. If your skin needs moisture, just moisture, this is it. Not sticky or greasy. My dry almost 50 yo face loves this.",2
"A truly magical gloss. The formula is not to thick or thin, not sticky at all and last very well. The colour Whitespace is stunning, it had just the right amount of glitter that just transforms your look, I love it with just a liner or over lipstick. Not alot of product however I usually dont go through gloss quickly so that can be over looked. The colour alone is unique in itself not to many shades out there that are similar. Highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a sexy glossy and reflective lip.",0
"A truly pleasant surprise...I have been disappointed with some Tarte palettes over the past year but this one is pretty spot on with pigmentation with the exception of two shades that needed a bit of coaxing with a primer...They blended well and low and behold...NO MUDDY mess! YEA! I like the eyeliner, the mascara and the lip product too...Nice surprise...I took a chance...It paid off...Especially with the 20 percent off sale on sale items!",3
"Attempting a winter away from tanning beds Ive been trying a few self tanners. A sales associate recommended this one to me on my last Sephora trip. The colour was nice and the smell was far less than any Ive ever used - was super impressed. But it faded horribly on me. Super patchy and uneven, and I did all the usual steps to prevent it from happening. Ended up having to scrub by skin nearly raw in order to make it look a little less obvious. Maybe I got a bad batch but I'd splurge on St.Tropez and deal with the smell before ever using this again.",2
"At this point, I'm no stranger to Too Faced palettes and there have been some misses but this is such a hit! I was a bit on the fence because of my fair coloring but the shades are beautiful in person! So many pinks to choose from and the colors are super blendable. I haven't tried the darkest one yet but I can see myself using this every day. I'm so pleased. I took off one star because its supposed to have a scent but mine is barely there. I thought it would be like the Peach palette which was amazing! No worries, though, the quality more than makes up for it.❤",2
"At this price point, I didn't expect the quality that I received. Yes, they are a touch powdery, (so you gotta watch your fall out), but the color payoff is impressive! The colors are fun, are super bright and the pans are huge. You are getting so much for your money, considering the same quality eye shadows are sold for $20 each. \nSuch a great purchase! Also for anyone aging & not loving it, matte colors are our friends...another reason why this palette is fantastic! This would make a great gift for someone new to makeup that wants to play and likes color.",4
"Auntie Laura really looked out for her deeper complexion family. I've been missing out! I absolutely love this powder; its just as great as the lighter translucent one. I used Jackie's tip to apply after primer, and it literally keeps my face oil free throughout the day. No complaints!",0
"Average. the red is pretty in the bottle, and nice on, but has more of an orange tone than i expected. the glitter one is alright too, but nothing super special, and a bit hard to see because the glitter isn't super thick. i wouldn't repurchase this.",0
A very nice step in my routine for added moisture. I wouldn't call this a crucial product to have but I do absolutely love applying it everyday. It helps my skin feel softer and it's such a luxury experience. It lasts a long time and I do think it's worth it. A HG essence for me.,0
"A very rejuvenating mask! The night before I was in a Wedding, I hardly got any sleep. I woke up, used this mask at 6am, and felt radiant and clean throughout the entire day! I just wish the price was a little better for the .5 ounce, but it will give me at least 5 uses. I have very sensitive and oily skin, and I did have a touch of redness on my forehead immediately after, but it went away within an hour.",0
"Avobenzone and most non-physical sunscreens irritate my skin badly and cause my eyes to burn, water, and turn red.  I spend too many hours of my life looking for SPF eye creams/concealers/shadows that might....just might...not have Avobenone, and, believe me, they have been impossible to find before this one. Especially SPF 30! have I have very hooded eyes, so I'm not much of an eye shadow-wearer, but I do like some brightening and neutralization on my lids. Also, I live in a desert, so I need all the SPF I can get, every day.  If this cream eyeshadow did not have SPF (esp. 30!), I wouldn't have tried it, but I was so excited to see SPF 30 and no Avobenzone, I bought it on the spot.  I have a couple of eyeshadows that cost $18 a piece, and they are packaged in a nice tube with a soft applicator. I dislike the jar packaging, and the texture of this eyeshadow is such that it goes on best when I apply with my fingertips. I tried various brushes and sponges, and this kind of ""rolls"" off them, or applies unevenly and gunks up.  Fingertip application melts this onto my lids just the way I want it to look, and it stays put, pretty much without creasing or melting, all day long. I am very glad I purchased this, because it looks great (natural and brightening) and I really appreciate the SPF.",3
avoid this at all costs. it's just a chunky glitter mess. nothing is worth the cost. please don't waste 30 dollars on this. buy her other highlighters if you want a highlighter. this is just 90s glitter.,4
"Awesome product! I usually experience transfer of mascara under my eyes and smudging of eyeliner, as it's generally too oily. Most concealers add to that and I end up with raccoon eyes by the end of the day. Not so with this concealer! It has a nice matte finish, which is perfect for me! Will definitely purchase again!",4
"Awesome product, so soft and the scent is amazing! The size of the lip balm compare to other lip balms in tubes is better! This one has 6.5g, most have from 3g-4.5g for the same price or a little less or a little more. I love the size of the tube cause it's easy to find in my purse compare to Fresh lip treatments/balms... I'm just happy!",2
Awesome stuff. Even though I'm 400 years old and it's the middle of winter in NYC I finish the day with my skin feeling great - smooth and hydrated with all traces of makeup effortlessly gone. Will definitely buy again.,2
Awesome tinted eye cream but needs a better shade range. it goes on smooth and creamy but I'm a light medium skin tone and needed to use the darkest shade available so it didnt look crazy light under my eyes.,1
"Awful! I am a big fan of toners, emulsions, serums, etc. and received a sample packet and was excited to try it. I took my makeup off, washed my face, added a toner and then layered this product on my face. \n\nOHMYGOD it smelled terrible!!! I can't even describe it but the smell alone is a strong reason for not buying it. The REAL issue I have is how bad it STINGS! Within a minute my face started to feel prickly all over. I added my moisturizer and hoped it would go away. 10 minutes later my face still feels prickly and still smells. I had a few other sample os this and I'm tossing the lot. I can't believe the price tag on this item when I came to write this review!",4
"Awful. Settled in each individual pore so that I could see the product. When I layered my foundation on top (using both beauty blenders and, another time, a very high quality foundation brush), my pores looked even worse, like I had millions of pale freckles. Never again.",2
A wonderful you tuber recommended this lip scrubber and I love it. My lips are always dry and chapped and this exfoliating brush takes of the dead stuff and prepares my lips to receive a lip mask at night,2
Based on the online swatches and the photos I was so excited to get these but when I got them in person the colours were nothing like they looked online. I'm fairly light skinned and most of them made me look like I was wearing concealer on my lips. So disappointing.,4
"Basically, it made my dry skin feel even dryer. I was somewhat perplexed to why my skin wasn't doing well when I was using it. And now I am done and switched to a more hydrating product, my skin is suddenly all better. I, personally, didn't get any visible benefit from it. Perhaps someone with combo or oily skin will like it more.",0
"BC has the best brow products. But these one right here is perfect for every different occasion. From glam to natural look. When your on the go each separately, powder and wax-pencil  are perfect. But when you want that bold & defined brow go for the wax-pencil and powder my favorite.",1
"Beautiful an along with the Mascara I have Enjoyed the both of these Beautiful Wear ALL DAY Products!!! They both Really Brought out the Blue within my eyes, and made it So Easy to Wear ALL Day Long without any flaking, or Smearing what-so-ever!!! I first tried out a sample size from in Sephora's Beauty Offers of the Mascara, and Once I tried it I was Ordering a Fullsize within the hour, Along with this Eyeliner!!!!! This has replaced my Tom Ford Eyeliner Pen, (Now dont get me wrong, I still LOVE that lining Pen!) but this is a Great Everyday Use Pen. I wish they would both come in brown though!!! The size makes it Very Easy to hold and actually apply the liner onto the top of my lids, and theres NO SKIPPING of the formula like with other products I have purchased within the past (like the Fenty pen!) This pen has a formula which when applied over a glitter eyeshadow the glitter does Not Bleed through!!! Its been difficult to find a formula which does this!!! I'm So Glad after purchasing so many eyeliners and mascaras I've finially found a Pen that covers Over Glitter Eyeshadows!!! And the matching Mascara is WIN, WIN for me aswell!!! I gave it 5 Stars Also!!!",3
"Beautiful and very sparkly eyeshadow, but it creased and faded on me so quickly!   I even tried to a grippier primer and set my eyes, but the outcome was the same.  It might work or someone with drier kids and more lid space than me.",2
"beautiful colors, but the glitter eyeshadow can get kinda chunky monkey on you. kind of annoying bc it can flake off throughout the day too. still enjoy the product as it makes cut creases super easy when you're on the go.",0
"Beautiful colors in this ""bar"". It was quite pricey so I waited a few months before investing in this highlighter.  Pigment and delicate pressed powder were gorgeous and looked wonderful on my skin. My only issue is the size, it's a tiny little compact with tiny little bars. I pulled one out to see how deep it went and it was barely half an inch. I wish there was more or that it wasn't that expensive. love the product itself just very pricey.",2
Beautiful colors on Rose. Very creamy formula gives lips a moisturized feeling for hours. The liner color on this formula fades quickly. The rose shade not as fast but rose does not last nearly as long as the shade violine does so it lost a star.,3
"Beautiful color story and packaging, this was my first Melt purchase and I am not disappointed. Does take some time to blend and patience but would be expected with the level of pigment. Went on beautifully with some Fix It +",2
"Beautiful color story , the star is for the packaging and mj stamp in pan , I want to love this but omgoodness the fall out is Terrible!!!!!!  talk about ruining my two hours of expensive makeup( I was looking Amazing before applying this mess had Cauldlie underneath too)to wash it all off because of this clumpy powder and glitter chunk party..... so messy my clothes hands and cheeks, nose,  chin, neck , everywhere!!!",2
"Beautiful color story, this inspires me to do a lot of looks. However some of the shades are a little hard to work with. That matte teal shade needs to be built up a lot on the eye to show up, and it’s very easy to blend it away into nothing. It also easily becomes muddy with other shadows mixed with it. I also tried one of the shimmer shades and it ended up being closer to a glitter. I almost wished I would’ve used a glitter glue under it because of how chunky it was and how much fallout I got from it. Overall I created a pretty look but it did take longer than usual to get it the way I want it.",0
"Beautiful colour, luxurious finish and serious staying power! I wore this for an 8hr shift with no need to reapply. Even lasted through a pasta dinner! I did use a liner (Nyx), but didn't fill in my lips with it. Even the glossy finish lasted! When I wore without a liner it had minimal feathering and some fading at about the 7hr mark. The formula is quite unique. It's slightly tacky and makes lips look full and juicy as promised. Even leaves a nice stain!",1
"Beautiful eyeshadows by PMG, I have the bronze seduction palette and this is on pl ar eith her special formula. I love this quad due to the multi dimensional finish and endless possibilities as shadows alone or as toppers. I prefer this over the huda new nude as this formula is superior, buttery, and not stiff. the looks you can create look dimensional and beautiful and the packaging is lux. The gold is basic looking compared to the rest of the shades but it is beautiful and different from other golds. I recommend!",0
"Beautiful! I put Earth on my outer corners and crease, Atik as a transition on the top edge of the crease, Orion patted on the lid and brushed under the outer half as a liner, and Bellatrix as a liner under the inner half and inner points. Everything blended like a dream! I was afraid that it would be too much for my cool-leaning neutral fair skin tone, but it was perfect, and really made my brown eyes pop. Next time, I'll probably use a liquid shimmer on the inner points, but I love the look and I love how the shadows performed.",3
"Beautiful packaging. This pen feels so good in the hand and has the best weight to it.  It's more of a wet/inky formula.  Also it's dual ended. The side with the gold band is stunning, but the other side I didn't care for.  The formula is not waterproof. For this reason, it won't be my go to for daily use, but a gorgeous option for special occasions.",4
"Beautiful palette but limited look possibilities. I love pinks and enjoyed this palette a lot when I got it but with time I realized that the shades in here pull to a very similar pink that all my looks seemed similar. quality is nice but shadows could be more buttery and not as stiff for 65dls. Had to give it away, did not reach for it and I had it for over a year.",0
"beautiful palette, the colors show up well even on a woc. I am very pleased with this powder. the mattes are rich and the shimmer shades are easy to use. I have worn this everyday since I brought it. it can go from day to evening without any issue.",2
"Beautiful pallet in a perfect shade range for my blue/green eyes. The colors are pigmented and have great staying power; I did not use a eyeshadow primer and it lasted all day. I’ve been playing around with different color combos and look forward to using the glittery colors for upcoming holiday parties! If you’re considering buying this, I highly recommend it. Feels like luxury eyeshadow and I prefer it over any of the naked pallets I have!",0
Beautiful red packaging. The brush design makes it perfect for setting my under eye with powder. The only con for me is the synthetic bristles. They are soft however I prefer real hair with my face powders. I expect natural hair with Hakuho-do brushes.,3
"Beautiful shade for my fair skin. I apply it over my moisturizer.  No fading or creasing throughout the day, even in the hot weather. Love the SPF!  I originally  bought this to use during the summer, but now use it daily.  I pair it with Laura Mercier caviar sticks to finish the look. I have switched to  cream eyeshadow, because I was having  allergic reactions to certain powder formulas.  I have never had a problem with this product and it definitely has a brightening effect.",4
"Been using this for 2-3 months and works as described! Makes you skin feel really smooth right after 1st use! Does make your skin slightly brighter, very useful to not look too tired. A nice additional step to your skincare if you want your skin to look a bit more rejuvenated in the morning. Haven't noticed any changes on my pores so no comment on that part.",0
"Been using this for years and am very happy with the moisturizing effect and has a pleasant light scent and is not greasy unless you put on too much (which basically applies to any hand cream). I don't have ultra dry hands and this is what works for me. Don't know how it would work for those with super dry hands, but I like it for my needs.",3
"before I bought I read a lot of reviews saying it was really thick and should be mixed with a face oil so I was a little curious as to what it was actually like. I found out that yes it is a little thick, but if you rub it between your fingers to emulsify it then it absorbs a lot better and spreads beautifully. It is a little heavy for the summer (even for dry skin people like me) so in the summer I switch it to my night cream to still give intense moisture while sleeping.",0
"Being super pale I struggle finding a good bronzer that doesnt make me look like I smeared milk chocolate over my cheeks. \nI use a wide, thick brush and very lightly go over my skin with this bronzer and it does a wonderful job of giving me a sun-kissed look without appearing like Dracula who fell in mud and did a poor job of washing it off. It smells amazing as well, and is buildable to your taste.",1
Being used for a month this phenomenal B oil doing it job fantastic. Yes indeed it's a thick oil. 2drops and 1 drop of argan light oil works fantastically for fall to spring. Summer either omit or 1drop b oil and 1 drop argan light oil works fine with  any water base  moisturizer . Now it gives clearaty brightness and even out skin tone. I simply like,3
"Benefit cosmetics are the holy grail of my brows. I always go to benefit brow bar to get my eyebrow work done, I love benefit cosmetic brow products so I decided why not go for this tweezer? I am so glad I purchased this tweezer, it can cling on to the tiniest of hairs and has never failed me. Great purchase!",0
"best collagen supplement! I have tried several. this one is not chalky or chunky or gross. it dissolves well in water with just the right amount of fizz and it actually tastes good! I hope they make other yummy flavors but this one is good. I love HUM! I didn't want to commit to a 30 day supply through HUM for collagen after bad experiences with large tubs from other places (skinnyfit, vital proteins) so this was a great way to try it first.",1
"Best concealer I've used to date!! I have them  all.. tarte shape tape, ud naked, ud all nighter, TF born this way, sephora brand, ulta brand, you name it.. stumbled upon this one and I wont be using any others except for a cut crease.. this is a game changer. Does not look cakey, blends great, hydrating, ahh need I say more??",1
Best coverage ever. I've tried most foundations out there that claim to be full coverage.  This one is the best. it's better then the double wear in the glass bottle IMO. A little goes a long way with this one so you dont need much. I have discolorations and old acne scars and it covers it all. I set with Laura Mercier translucent powder. I use it with a beauty blender. Love Love Love,3
"Best ever! I used the Gimme Brow for the longest time, until the product size changed to a smaller version. At first, didn't like this packaging because of the extra step in removing the brush, unscrewing the cap. I also didn't care for the larger size for travel purposes. Another reason for loving Gimme Brows. Well, I bought this  two years ago, use it every day and still have half of the gel left, still in pristine condition, other than pulling away from the sides of the container. I absolutely love the brush because you can build the color, and it blends beautifully. I will not use any other eyebrow color because I am so happy with this one. Well worth it!",3
Best eyeliner ever!!! I have tried so many and they all ran at the outer corners of my eyes after a couple hours. I have not had a problem with this eyeliner and there are so many colors to choose from....absolutely love it!!,3
"Best Eye Liner Ever! I Usually Use A Cream Eye Liner Because Of Smooth Application And Bold Color But I Received This Pencil In A Trial Pack And Thought I Would Give It A Go. It Is My New Go To And Will Be Getting It In Other Colors! It Really Does Glide On And Stays Put. I Had Watery Eyes This Morning, Didn't move! I Groom Dogs And Had Some Shakers Today As Well, Covered In Suds And Water, It Still Didn't Move. My Job Is Pretty Hard On Makeup So If It Survives A Day I Am Impressed; This Not Only Survived It Looked As Fresh At The End Of The Day As It Did When I Left.",0
"Best inner lash liner I have honestly ever used. It took a bit of a learning curve (you have to dab it on and let it dry before blinking) but it lasts all day for me. I almost can't go without it on my top inner lash line. Unfortunately, I no longer want to support Kat Von D's product line for non-makeup related reasons, but I absolutely recommend this liner if you are in the market for one.",1
BEST MASK EVER!!! I'm so in love with this clay mask I'll never be without it again! I saw results right after the first time i used this and my skin has just been looking better and better after each use. My pores were barely visible after the second time I used this and i had enlarged pores. Thank you Sand & Sky for this AMAZING product!,4
BEST PALETTE EVER !!!!! I loveeeee this eye palette! The shimmer is ridiculous!!! I get so many compliments every time I wear this!! It stays on ALL DAY and does not irritate my skin!!! The blush is best used as an eyeshadow! :) The package is also super adorable!!  I am stocking up on these so I never run out!!! A+++++++++++,1
"Best part of this sponge is the unique curve around the middle and sharp, tiny pointed tip which is great for under eyes and around nose. Also nice if you wear eyeglasses for applying foundation under them. It did get a miniscule tear shortly after purchase, but nothing to complain about. I feel like the best approach with washing makeup sponges is to have short natural fingernails because I could see long nails, especially artificials, quickly destroying these. It's been about a month since I bought this and it's still relatively clean, though it can take several dabs of beauty blender cleanser and scrubbing to fully rid it of stains. Product pickup is just okay. I've never met a sponge that didn't require going over and over again with foundation, but I'm fairly new to the sponge game. In fact, unlike many other reviews, I've never tried the Beauty Blender sponge (prefer lesser priced options.) I have tried other brands and so far this is my favorite.",1
"best product! I'm totally addicted to the scent but ... wait for it..... A SCENT THAT ACTUALLY LASTS!  Did I mention it does a phenomenal job moisturizing the skin? wow, it's a must have for sure in my opinion!",2
"Best purchase ever. I'm not too good with eye make up and this makes it so easy . The mint shade is to die for . Strangely you can just use this for a complete eye look . If you're travelling , you can add a small matte palette plus this and you're golden . The formula is awesome, its all worth the heft price tag. Even when it fades , it fades to a lovely , sexy ,sophisticated sheen . I think this is the best among the three but if money is no object , I would purchase all three .",2
"Best skin care...bar none.  I have tried everything.  I have mature, sensitive skin and love this polish.  I see some comments about it being too harsh on their skin, but there is a sensitive skin version that is fantastic!  My skin glows!",3
"best tweezer out there but delicate, I would have given this 5 stars for sure If I had written my review just 5 minutes ago...before I fumbled them and they landed right on the tip and bent so bad it wount grip a single hair anymore. I was sitting down so it wasn't even that big of a fall. other than that there is not a single bad thing to say of these tweezers. will I spend the nearly $30 on them again? they are in my cart as I type this...I'll just need to be more careful...but it would be nice if they were made out of something a little more sturdy for the price point that they are.",2
"Best undereye brightening cream since Dior bb eye cream that was discontinued. Oh how I miss that! I was pleasantly surprised with this. The immediate effect is good, but with continued use of is even better. It is also very affordable.",2
"Best vitamin C serum out there!  I've used this on and off for 5 years, but always come back to it! I will layer it with my nightly retinol every other night and it's amazing! safe to dot around the contours of the eye also!!",2
"Beware all the reviews on here bashing this product because it didn't take away their shine. \nREAD THE DESCRIPTION! It does not say that it's a shine stopper or matifyer. It's even called SATIN skin mist. It says it won't add extra shine, which I fine to be accurate.\nThis a luxury skin mist at a luxury price. It's wonderful for setting makeup or refreshing during the day if it's in your price range. If you have oily skin, you'll still need a matifying primer.",2
"Beware, this color is not the same as pictured online. I was hoping it would have the peachy blush color as shown, but it's rather a straight up dim orange/beige. The scent is also VERY strong. I will try it a few more times before I decide if I want to keep it as a bronzer. Another thing, the compact is a LOT smaller than I expected.",3
"Big Night is a little brighter than I was expecting, but it's very pretty. This really does stay on without feeling cakey. I put a little balm over it after a few hours of wear, and it still didn't budge. And it has more depth than typical matte lipsticks. It has zero fragrance and is in a sleek little case. Feels like nothing but looks great!",3
"Biossance Serum smell terrible. Super goop sun screening has silicons as 2nd ingredient, how is it be a clean skincare?Caudalie Vinosource Moisturizing is mot moisturizing at all. Only good is the Prism. Total waste of money",3
bite beauty sent me this after reading my last review on the new formulated lip balm. I was very disappointed that they changed my favourite go to lip balm but was plesently surprised at how much I love this mask. I love wearing it at night time before bed but also I'm the morning before work.,0
"Black Cherry Baby is a beautiful, sheer berry gloss and I love that I can swipe it on from the stick instead of a doe foot applicator.  This shade looks beautiful on my NW10 skintone and because it's sheer, I can wear it with almost any makeup look.  One thing to remember, the stick clicks up but does not go down so only bring up enough to use.",2
"Blazing Sunset is SO pretty, and unique, I love the sultry pink..but I also own Sapphire Pink , Party, and Crystal Caves!! i think the names really drew me in!! But they are beautiful, and I have to get the adhesive!! These are stunning, and you get a good amount. They have a flip cap too. Highly Recommend!! Love the Pink ones!! Stock up for summer.",2
"Bond Girl is my perfect nude!  It's a mid toned rosey berry shade that isn't at all too dark, bright or brown on my very fair, cool toned skin.  I have so many pink/rose/mauve nudes and none of them have the right mix of rose and brown that this does.  The Matte Revolution formula is creamy, goes on without tugging and is pretty long lasting.  I can't recommend this enough!",2
"Both are so tiny and cute, idk if it was worth $14 but they're both very pigmented and smooth. I didn't feel like it was drying or chalky like others, it just felt like a matte lipstick. If it's dry, just put on a little lip balm before applying the lipstick. I really love misfit, it's a muted red which is just my type.",0
"Both of these products are amazing! I have oily skin and I struggle with hormonal acne which I use retinoids to control. Finding quality skin care that plays well with retinoids is really a challenge. Neither product contains any salicylic acid, yet is still appropriate for oily, acne prone-skin. That is a rare gem to find since it seems like EVERY moisturizer for oily skin contains some kind of salicylic or glycolic acid which is a huge NO for skin that's on a retinoid.\n\nI was worried about the Squalene/Tea Tree oil bc personally I find the smell of pure Tea Tree oil really gross. The smell in this is very subtle and disapates very quickly. The texture of the oil is very light and silky thanks to the Squalane. (I was a die-hard Josie Maran Argan Oil fan but I may be a Biossance Squalane convert after this...) \n\nThe Probiotic Gel Moisturizer is very light, yet effective, and I could see it being great for the hot humid summer months where I live. Mixing the Gel and the Oil together is a perfect combo for oily skin during the winter when I am tending to get a little drier, but I don't necessarily need skincare for ""Dry""-type skin. \n\nI really do love the fact that the Gel doesn't have any fragrance either since that can also be super irritating to sensitive skin.  Both of these little beauties I work very well under makeup as well. Oh and A+ to Biossance for being CRUELTY FREE!!! \n\nIf you have oily/combo/sensitive skin give this a try!!",2
"Bought ""Fearless"" which looks like a scary bright raspberry purple in tube but goes on as a beautiful SHEER slightly deeper pink. Think a light version of Clinique's infamous ""Black Honey."" It's just a tiny pop of colour for your lips (& makes your teeth look whiter). It's super moisturising and non sticky-no glitter or shimmer and super sheer making it perfect for all day wear.",3
"bought it after debating for a while.. heard mixed reviews but decided to try it out for myself. it does not work. $15.00 isn't much but it's not worth the money AT ALL. it doesn't do anything. it just glosses your lips and gives it moisture, no ""plump"". \nso disappointing.",0
Bought this as I have been wanting a red glitter gloss since summer. Recieved friday night via mail and took back to store Saturday morning. Cute in theory but it was clumpy and barely any product came out on applicator after swirling around multiple times. When I returned to store the associate had to peel off plastic topper on top just for product to come out.,2
"Bought this as I love ciate products. Recieved friday night via mail and took back to store Saturday morning. Cute in theory but it's too dark, was clumpy and dry and broke my lips out when I tried it on.",2
"bought this at the recommendation of an employee and it's a great suggestion. I already have long curly lashes, so something like this meant for volume is nice. I love how it's not runny or clumpy like previous brands I've used.",4
"Bought this because it sounded pretty useful, however it did nothing and made a crumbly mess in my sink. Its basically just the product rolling off your face. Pores the same, texture the same. Waste of money. Glad I only paid $5 for it.",3
Bought this brush a few months ago from overseas and it's fantastic!  The bristles are soft but firm and smoothly apply foundation.  The rectangular shape helps get into the creases around my nose for precise application.  The name is a little misnomer as it is not the brush that retracts but the protective case around the bristles.  It comes with a cap for easy travel.,3
"bought this for my 26-year-old daughter,  provides great coverage- doesn't cause breakouts to my sensitive acne prone skin, good coverage and buildable and doesn't transfer onto clothing. makes my skin poreless and natural looking - can't tell I'm wearing makeup.",3
"Bought this for my husband in December 2018, he uses it 3 - 4 times a week, and has only had to charge it twice... *mic drop* In all seriousness it offers a gentle exfoliation and facial massage and is cost effective because you don't need to buy replacement parts like brush heads like other tools. So easy to sanitize and keep clean too.",0
"Bought this on a whim and returned the next day. Not worth $20. It's so tacky and dry that you have to drag the applicator across your lips, tugging the whole time. Barley any color and then your lips feel like glue. Gross.",2
"Bought this on a whim before a six week long work trip. It was the only eye palette I brought and I never tired of it (but I'm a neutrals fan). I have taken it on shorter trips and used the pink as blush and the champagne as highlighter. I have ND Gold, TF Sweet Peach, Venus XL II, and a ton of singles and I find myself reaching for this most work mornings. Very tempted to get a back up. I love how the mattes are very buildable as I don't like super pigmented shadows when I am just trying to make a work look at 4am.",1
"Bought this on a whim due to rave reviews - thank you to all who left honest reviews about this palette. I was super hesitant to buy this at first, because I wasn't sure what to do with the light olive green color. I'm really glad I went for it. It's a great palette, perfect for everyday and evening looks. It does take some experience to know how to use each color but it really is a fantastic color combo. ND does it again, another perfect palette with great color pay off and buildable/ blendable shades. I have light to med skin, with yellow undertones and a hooded lid. I'm a natasha fan girl for life",4
"Bought this on a whim when it was half off on sale, with the extra 20% off. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I do! Although it's almost all glitter and sparkle shadows, you can make neutral/work appropriate looks and colorful wild looks.\n\nThe cons are that it's overpriced at full price, there is a lot of fallout on almost all shadows, and you may need another palette if you want good highlights and transition shades. \n\nEven with as much as I like it, I wouldn't spend the full price on this...but if this goes sub $30 again, it's totally worth picking it up. A pleasant surprise!! :)",4
Bought this product as an alternative to an exfoliator face scrub and love it! I have used it all over my face as well as for spot treatments to certain areas. I didn't get any irritation or tingling. Super easy to use and my face is smooth and looks and feels smoother. Will definitely continue to purchase this product!,4
Bought this set so that i could try the premier cru products so touted by this brand.  I didn't like any of them. I was particularly disappointed by the moisturizer--it didn't make my skin feel at all hydrated. Eye cream was just okay--hydrdating but not long lasting. I'll stick with Lancome Absolue--pricier but worth it.,2
"bought this without reading the ingredients list, which I rarely ever do....ended with a product with alcohol as one of the top ingredients....didnt notice this until after I used this and my face felt good for the first 30mins then shriveled up. it made my skin worse than before.",1
"Bought two different colors in this and the Cream Beige was a match.  It is very thin, but it does cover enough. If you are looking for something that looks like you're not wearing makeup, then this is it.  I do not want a ""make-up"" look, being a mature woman, so this works very well for me.",3
"Boy collector is that perfect red for the holidays. The formula isn't drying and gives you lips a hydrated look. Even though it's called demi matte, it's more of a staying power of a matte but is satin. I like the applicator, which is shaped to where you can line your lips with product and then fill it in. Not transferproof!! But touch ups are easy as i found layering isn't much of a problem. Very opaque and i didn't need to use lipliner for this shade.",1
"breakfast club is described as a strawberry red but I would personally describe it as a neon red. it is bright! the formula of these are great, super moisturizing and long lasting for a bullet lipstick. I'm looking forward to trying more shades.",4
"broke as soon as I opened it. I thought maybe it was just a bad one. when back and got a new one, used it one, only did my top lip then broke AGAIN!!! went to another Sephora bough a two more different shade and once again they broke! done trying with this brand. started to use a brush to apply it since, you know I now own three of them. not the best shade at least one me. comes off after drink water or coffee and smudges everywhere. this brand sucks especially for the price. never again",0
"Brush application instead of a sponge really makes the difference here. Just the lightest brush application followed by a finishing powder of choice makes all the difference between 1) longevity of the product throughout the day and 2) longevity of the product overall before needing a refill. The texture is a little balmy/tacky at first, but just blend out and let dry or set with finishing powder. Less is more here.",2
Brush heads have definitely changed since I started using Clarisonic 13 years ago. Deep pore brush is rough.  Radiance brush is flimsy. Would expect better quality and consistency considering how expensive brush and brush heads are...,3
Brush is too big and it picks up way too much product. It is thick and clumps. The mascara tube is designed oddly larger than it needs to be. it doesn't lenghthen as described at all. Everything about this too damn wrong. Going to return this.,3
but all jokes aside speaking about my role title these two pallets are a chocolate girl's dream you can get bold looks and neutral looks depending on what neutral is for you and not have to worry about lasting power and pigmentation the colour story on both pallets are absolute stunners as melt always does with their Innovative palette/ eyeshadow ideas I recommend these 100% love me some Melt,2
"But it works.  I'll admit it took two attempts. The first shade I bought was Vanilla. It was way to light.  I'm fair skinned AND mature skinned.  At 64 years old, I remain addicted to foundation.  And at my age, I'm not looking to hide my lines. My wrinkles are here to stay. However, I don't want to look like dried mud or the Grand Canyon.    But I was intrigued by this foundation...so here goes \nA. It's definitely full-coverage but very liquid and not thick and this is a great thing.\nB. A little goes a long, long way. Application is key with this.  I apply to the top of my hand and mix with a drop of Argan oil. Then I take one of those dense brushes that looks like a tennis raquet and work the foundation in (Jouer sells this brush on their website--I use a cheap one and it works just as well) This is a quick-drying foundation and after drying, I buff with a buff brush.\nC.  Very carefully, I apply powder contour and very lightly then a light touch of blush and I'm good to go.\nThere's a definite learning curve with this and you really have to get the correct shade.  Once you find the correct shade and application down this is great stuff.                         The reason it fell short of five stars for me is due to the fact that it really is a challenge to find the right shade and you need to play around with the application.  Thank you for reading!",3
Buxom has the most beautiful shades and this set is no exception. It goes on smooth and when the light catches it the color is amazing. I'm not a fan of glosses however this brand is the exception to the rule for me.,3
"Bye bye under eye bags and circles! I love that this product comes in a pot and not a tube. I hate wasting product, especially when it can be pricey like IT products can be. I have just started using them recently and I have found them to be totally worth the price. A little of this product goes a long way so it should last a long time. I would definitely recommend this product to others if they are looking for something to brighten under eyes and smooth the area. It is heavier, hydrating cream with a light scent that is not over powering,",2
"By far the best powders ever! I have acne scars, hormonal break outs but Stellar powders do not cling to your dry skin, or make you look cakey, nor does it make your pores look bad and it doesn't crease your facial lines. I've tried the iconic Laura mercira but it doesn't compete with Stellar. These powders give you a glow dewy look so if you want a matt look try their regular powder. You won't be let down.",0
BY FAR THE BEST! The colors are amazing and so easy to blend. This pallet makes contouring so easy. I have tried the A.B.H. contour pallet and many other name brands this is the best. Highly recommend!!!,4
"CAKEY - HARD TO BLEND - SHOWS EVERY CREVICE ... Was excited about this due to all the hype from TATI The Beauty Blogger. After trying I don't believe that this is for mature skin especially. I'm 44 and have minimal signs of aging.. w/ this it makes me look 10 years older & like I have a dehydrated face. Settles in every pore & line possible. Going back to IT! & Pat McGrath. Bummed this didn't work out. I'm sure its amazing on folks that love a super heavy matte finish. It is no question full coverage, the heaviest I've tried yet.",2
cannot live without! I have dark circles under my eyes and while this doesn't eliminate them completely it definitely helps. I notice a difference within 5 mins of applying and now I can't live without it.,4
Can they make contour any easier- blends effortlessly- be sure to lock the cap after each use and you should be fine- not much product but you don't need much either.  a bit on the expensive side- i bought this during the holiday bonus sale and enjoyed it so much i bought a back up before the price went up.,2
can't live without it! I use it multiple times a day and it feels great on my face! first bottle is almost gone so I just ordered a second one. maybe I should try a different flavor like rose? but idk I love the coconut water so much!!!!,1
Can't say enough about this Luminizer Primer.  Gives a nice healthy glow to your skin and makes a great primer.  I have purchased at least 3 times now and don't like to be out of it.  A small amount goes a long way.  It helps especially during winter months to put a small amount of moisturizer on prior to the primer.,3
"CAN'T SAY ENOUGH! Okay one would think that at this point in time that everything that could be made in makeup has been made. However, this product the Hollywood Flawless Filter, truly is a different type of product and is in a class of its own in my opinion. This product, and I'm calling it a product because I can't call it a filter and I can't call it a foundation or highlighter because it really is none of those on its own, but at the same time it's almost a combination of all three of those. This made my skin look so very pretty in my opinion and I'm not a spring chicken anymore by any means! It gives me such a luminous glow without any glitter or shimmer, but at the same time it's not tacky or sticky. It is so innovative. If you're on the fence, JUST GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE PLUNGE AND TRY THIS because it's pretty amazing the way it works. Whether you wear it under foundation or a little bit on top of your foundation or if you just want to put it on when you're not wearing any makeup for that day it can be used as a tinted moisturizer or a very very light coverage foundation. But remember, it is mostly in the same league as a tinted moisturizer when it comes to coverage. Just try it... you're not going to be disappointed! Oh and a little bit goes a LONG way.",2
"Chai has been my go-to-favorite lipstick for a long time and I'm honestly heartbroken they're getting rid of it. It's honestly the perfect lipstick for almost every skin tone. It's beautiful, pigmented and not overly creamy like the new formula is.",0
"changed my skin! I got a sample of this and it made such a huge difference in my skin, discolorations, etc.  I am so bummed it is so expensive because this product is a game changer!  and I have really sensitive skin.",2
"Ch-Ch-Changes is my favorite Marc Jacobs gloss. It's a beautiful russet sort of color with gold and greenish reflects. It's unlike any gloss color I've ever seen. I get constant compliments on it whenever I'm wearing it. If you like unique colors, I say go for it!",2
"Classic.  I like the smaller size, and both shades are seriously universal.  They feel nice applied but are not in themselves moisturizing... if anything my lips feel a bit drier after it wears off, which it does quickly.  But its a nice amount of shine and colour.",2
"Color of both the blush and the highlighter is off for my skin tone. The blush is too purple, and the highlighter is too light for my fair-medium skin. I also don't think they last very long, even with a setting spray.",0
"Colors are very much the same in UD, Bite & Anastasia. Im not a fan of red but Mercier makes great product & this is a good classic color. Not usually a tarte fan tbh but this is a pretty lip balm, it does have a strong mint scent. Personally I dislike scented makeup from this tarte lipbalm to toofaced chocolate line. Just not my thing. Good value. Tge ""sample"" sizes are much more than that, they are very generous bonus sizes - easily last more than a month. I do wish Sephora would make the bags either biodegradable or reusable in some way - this goes for favories, play and all sets really.",3
"Color was okay..I am light beige complexion. The applicator was a mess for me even after several days.. smell was okay. It was sticky.. grateful I have a younger sis I can say the cons..and any pros..and this one went from me to her to her oldest daughter. We all wanted to like it. I do like other Sephora lip products, however this was a fail.",3
"Comfortable and refreshing  mask, no rashes or breakouts. Nothing earth shattering tho. Not much plumping IMHO, but only used it once. For those that say it peels the skin its from the Sodium Phytate, made from rice bran. I use a peel made with it and the peel does tighten the skin but rarely peels my skin and its a self neutralizing mask (no rinsing). I guess if you have sensitive skin, it could happen.",3
"Comfortable, wearable, easy, work appropriate lipstick with pretty decent staying power. This is in my purse right now. Using these requires no thought, little maintenance and I will buy more colors once I get a change to audit which I already have against what is available at sale time.",2
"Coming from someone who has tried nearly every lip moisturizing product on the market, this product is a holy grail!! Totally in love with the smell of the sweet candy mask! This jar is huge & for how little you actually have to apply its worth every penny. Definitely appreciated the silicone applicator included in the packaging too , I wash it after each use to keep my lip product clean & fresh without anything possibly contaminating it.",0
completely a holy grail product for me! just turned 50 and this stuff has helped with saggy jawline etc. it really is the one product I will not got without.  a little goes a long way so the price point is really fantastic.,3
"Completely disappeared after 2 hours.  I tried using 2 different primers, and no primer and it makes no difference.  Color disappears after a couple of hours.  Very disappointing considering the very high price tag.  Not sure if this applies to other shades in the range. \nI only tried Moment-O.   Returned it.",0
"Completely obsessed with these! I've been using them for years after hearing about lead content in most lipsticks.  Super easy to use, amazing formula... matte but more moist than most.  Long wear time and high pigment.  Would love to see a little bluer red than red velvet, but I wear it ever day and have like 6 colors!",0
"Complexion Rescue is my go-to for no-makeup makeup. It's moisturizing, but not greasy and makes my skin look like I've just finished a great sheet mask. It blurs imperfections - pores and blotchiness - but still looks like skin, not heavy foundation. \n\nI'm fair and Birch 1.5 is perfect for me. The shade Opal 1 was light enough to be a highlighter.",1
"Couldn't  resist these new colors when I was abroad this Spring. I bought Dolce Vita, Wicked Ways, Tender Years and Deep Throat. All shades are very sheer, but with just enough color to brighten up my fair skin. I adore Wicked Ways, a truly beautiful shade that I have received compliments on every time I wear it. Just remember it's a balm, not a lipstick!",4
"Creamy, long-lasting, buildable coverage SECRET concealer! Love this guy on my undereye! It helps vanish my dark circles in a very natural way. It does crease quite a bit if you don't go over with a powder on top. You can also use it on other spots on your face- not just your undereye. Also, the colours available seem misleading. I bought the 3.7 since I found it to be more yellow undertone than other shades within the medium tones although it is marketed as with a pink undertone. I'm not sure if I'm the only one who feels this way. Otherwise, I am loving this concealer so far. It's small and travel-friendly. A little goes a long way!",0
"CT lipsticks have a vanilla fragrance and and a wonderful saturated color palette to choose from. Hard to choose which colors to try, I’ve chosen a nice color and a pretty dusty pink. The cases are great to find in a handbag as they’re colorful and shiny! Big help! The lip color is the type you can use sparingly and have almost the same wear time as putting a generous amount on and wearing all day. Almost like a stain, at least on me.",3
"Cute but it's battery operated! Even Clinique has devices in this price range that are rechargeable and come with a charging cable and stand. Despite coming with batteries, it's still going back. It will get too annoying having to buy batteries like it's the 90s.",0
"Dark circles and puffiness are my #1 beauty challenge, and I've tried every imaginable product to address this. Magic Eye Rescue Cream is amazing once I figured out the right amount to use. Too much, and it pilled and smeared my makeup... but just a tiny touch of this cream and my undereye area looks bright, smooth, younger! My skin is dry in the winter, and this formula is perfect for day or night.",2
"Dear DrunkElephant lovers, I apologize in advance - this is not the product I would spend my money on again.\nLet me start off by saying that I have lifelong dark undereye circles, trialed on eye creams since about age 14. Due to glowing reviews and Vitamin C’s superpower as a lightening and elasticity agent, I dutifully purchased this product and used it for about 2 months with… no changes really. I do agree that DE C-Tango did a good job of hydrating the delicate undereye area without burning or irritation. What I was expecting, however, is the drunk-elephant-miracle of skin transformation, and it didn’t happen. My eye circles stayed very much the same, as did very fine lines around the sides of my eyes that started to form as the early 30ies hit. Regretfully, will not repurchase, but still love other products from the brand, such as Protini Polypeptide Cream.",1
"Decent quality for price.  I regretted buying this after I read the reviews, but I am not experiencing the breakage other reviews mentioned.  I also did not raise the product up in the tube so that may be part of the reason.  I watched the product video and the tip about letting the product sit on my skin to warm up is fantastic advice.  Product went on super smooth and blended great.  Cant wait to do a full face with it because I looked crazy without foundation, eyes and blush when I tried this.",3
"Decided to give this a try after using the Bite Beauty lip scrub for a few years. The stick formula intrigued me and the price point is very good.\n\nI can see why many people like this product; it's very gentle and easy to use if you're in a rush. However, I personally prefer my lip scrubs to be a bit more gritty to fully loosen any dead skin on my lips and this is too light for me. I've used this for about three weeks now and if it gets more exfoliating the further you go, it hasn't happened to me yet. I'll be going back to my holy grail lip scrub, the Bite Beauty one, but again, if you're on the go and want to keep an easy-to-use scrub in your purse, this is great product for that. It just doesn't get the full job done for me.",1
Decided to try these after using the Dark Spot Dots and getting good results. The day they arrived I had the beginnings of a zit right under my nose. I put on a dot and left it overnight.and the next morning it hadn't developed and never did. It stayed a bump until it disappeared. Used a dot on another bump and again it was soon gone. also did the job without drying out my skin.,4
"Definitely doesn't leave a ""glow"" like I expected, but the dry oil sinks in fast and leaves me feeling clean and hydrated. Smell lasts forever and I don't feel like I need perfume when wearing this. The brush helps diffuse the sparkles which can come out of the nozzle a little clumpy- I have not had any trouble with the product coming out like some other reviews.",0
Definitely like this eye cream. A little goes A LONG WAY!!! I feel my under eye is more moisturized throughout the day. I've only been using this for 2 days so haven't seen a huge change yet in my lines or puffiness.,1
"Definitely moisturizes and depuffs, but that's about it.  With regular use the last 2 months, I haven't noticed a difference in the few crow's feet I have (32 years old) as this product claims to help with.  It smells good, and feels nice - not super thick, but has good staying power.  It doesn't cause other makeup to ""pill up"" or cause my sensitive eyes to react.  I like that it's a cleaner product, but was hoping it would actually help with the crows feet.  I'll continue using, but look elsewhere once I use it all up.",0
"Definitely more of a satin finish but it feels matte and doesn't leave your skin looking oily even after 12+ hours of wear. I actually think it looks it's best after you've worn it for a few hours. I haven't noticed any oxidation but keep in mind it is a bit hard to colour match based on the online description. I had a sample of 5.5 and my actual colour is 4 neutral. It's claims are true, lightweight and full coverage. I didn't  notice the cooling affect they mention but my face feels so soft and velvety. I used to use Georgio Armani Luminous Silk but imo this is better and $30 cheaper.",2
"Definitely Pros and Cons to this. Pros - Lot of product and a good bang for your buck! The shape of the pencil really helped to get both small hair-like strokes and larger areas. Cons - I don't know if maybe the formula was changed, but this was waxy. Like a candle. It was hard to apply and I was scared of breaking it because I was having to apply so much pressure to get results. Also, I know this is just an eyebrow pencil, but the color range is abysmal.... If you are on a budget and one of the three colors matches you, this might be an okay pencil. But overall I think there are several drug store brands that might be better and have more shade variety.",1
Definitely recommend! This paired with the serum and cream help my skin feel moisturized and minimizes my pores. My skin even has a glow to it. A little bit goes a long way. I got a free sample thanks to Influenster and I'm so glad I did!,4
Definitely the best tinted SPF moisturizer there is. Goes on smoothly and easily and doesn't make your skin oily. \nJosie Maran also has a great one but this one surprised me by being even better (shocking). The texture of this one feels much better and less greasy.\n\nI use a touch of this with 1 pump of drunk elephant Dbronzi. The combination is stunning and it gives the most beautiful glow and natural tan. It's skin care and makeup at the same time so your skin will love you for it.,4
"Definitely waterproof, but doesn't give enough coverage. I used it on my 57 year old hands to try and cover freckles and sunspots, and landed up using 2 coats, but it still didn’t give complete coverage. And my hands aren't that bad. Plus it settled into the fine lines on my hands.",3
"Definitely worth it to get to try all these products; I think the mask that comes with it is actually a pretty decent if not full size! I'm new to Boscia but fell in love with the cleanser included in this kit and figured I'd just get this for the price. The cleanser made my face feel super face clean yet hydrated, and the mask is a fun peel-off that actually peels off well provided that you let it fully dry and apply a thick enough layer.",4
"Despite their claim that this is ""Ideal for normal to dry skin"", I found this cleanser to be incredibly drying. Strangely, the texture of the cleanser itself is really creamy, but when rinsed off my skin feel stripped. Really disappointed by this.",3
"Did a lot of ingredients research and comparison to items I already own and decided to try this Peeling Solution--and now I am addicted. Once a week is just right for my slightly sensitive skin, and in just one month can already see clearer skin, smaller pores, and disappeared fine lines in forehead and around my smile. Recommended to users of all ages, this little bottle, so reasonably priced, allowed me to seriously downsize and get rid of 3 other separate bottles of toners I'd been using daily.",3
"Did anybody else's container come with a seal? I felt uncomfortable using mine because it had no seal or anything. It seemed super congealed, and there wasn't much product. I didn't even use it because it seemed sketchy like it'd been used before or something. I'll stick with Benefit Porefessional from now on. I'd love to hear feedback about the consistency and whether or not anybody else had a seal on their product! Winky Lux is usually awesome.",4
"didn't do much for my makeup application. used it twice, broke me out so bad both times and been using the same products otherwise for over 6 months never had a problem. if you're sensitive to breakouts DO NOT USE THIS. Worst primer I've ever used I'm glad it was a 100 point sample I would have been so angry if I spent money on it. it's going in the trash",1
didnt work for me at all.  on the box it states not to be alarmed as the serum brings dark spots etc to the surface but they slough off.  well I'm half a bottle in.  they came to the surface weeks ago... I now have more dark spots than ever.  but they aren't going away.   definitely not for me.,3
"disappointed,  i have been wanting a full size palette in this brand forever.  i mean its natasha denona so i was expecting something pretty amazing. anyway 25 for such a small palette is a bit steep but i figured yolo and got it anyway.  so i sat down to create my first look and did my normal routine,  set my eye and applied the lilac shade. it was very dark and the blend was awful,  so i added the blue and blended it out to create a nice multicolor fade. it just got severely muddy and was so dark and patchy. i was like wow this is worse than some of my  20$ palettes.  so i wiped it all away .   i tried to use it one other time and the same thing happened,  i have hundreds of Palettes. not even kidding,  hundreds. this one is one of the worst i have ever worked with. maybe i got a bad batch or maybe someone had tampered with it but i basically just wasted the money because it is unworkable without becoming patchy and unflattering.",4
Disappointed!  I like the feel if the foundation and the texture.  About 5 hours of wear I looked like an oily mess.  The crazy thing is I am normal to dry skin. the color was very good.   I will have to return. :(,3
disappointed in this product. I'm happy though that I received a sample cause this product did exactly what I was afraid it would do.... it settled into my dry skin and barely covered my redness. I still want to try the serum version but this is basically a BB cream that goes from Green to beige....,4
Disappointed.  Love small mascaras I can take on the go.  I feel like they stay fresh longer in the mini size.  Was excited at first because it went out very nice.  But after a couple of hours I noticed I had black smudges on my upper lid.  This has continued to happen every time I use it.,2
"Disappointed! My favorite foundation is discontinued so I am in search of another one. I read all the positive reviews for this brand and decided to give it a try.  For some reason this foundation looks very cakey on my skin.  I tried applied it with both a brush and a sponge but it looks awful.  Makes my pores/texture issues extremely more visable. For the hefty price tag I definitely did not expect that.  After trying multiple brands, I found Laura Mercier to be the best overall.",4
Disappointed with how little product you get. This is not a full size product. Color is nice. I agree with other reviews that the product does feel a little dry and pulls on lips as it's being applied.,1
"Disappointing. I usually use UD all nighter, and once I've used this up, I think I will probably go back to it. My face feels greasy at the end of the day, and thr most is so fine, I felw like I have to pump it 20 times to get any product. Smells great, though. Just not powerful enough fo rmy ultra oily complexion.",2
"disappointing results... I heard so much great things about ND and this mini was the perfect way to wet my feet. I was loving the colors. they are moderately pigmented but fade so quick, even with a primer. sad panda for sure...",1
"Disappointing, unfortunately. I always think of Mario products as being shocking miracle workers but this lip balm was just a lip balm, and not that great if one at that. Reminds me of Supergoop's in texture and effect.",0
"Does an ok job at removing some types of make up (powders mostly, not so great with my liquid foundation) but what really ruined it for me was the glitter. I don't want glitter in my brush cleaner that doesn't seem to come off my brushes no matter how much I rinse.",0
"Does not crease! I don't even use concealer but this one really blends well so I keep reaching for it in the morning. lovely texture, beautifully blends and sets really well. I wear my dior cushion foundation on top and nothing bad to say so far. would recommend :)",1
"don't be fooled by the reviews. this eye cream is not worth your money for how much it is. it barely hydrates my undereyes so if you have dry skin, stay away! there is only minimal brightening and have not noticed much depuffing either. I always try to use up products even if I don't like it but I've only used 1/8 of this and I don't want to use it anymore. i bought this a while ago so unfortunately I cannot exchange for a different eye cream. I am so disappointed and unhappy I wasted my money on this...",0
DON'T BUY\nI have wasted my money buying this. The message head's vibrations are so weak that you wont feel it on your face. I had to take it to Sephora store to be tested and at the end they were confused too about this product not working properly.,3
"Don't know what all the good reviews are about, but this is not even good for a spare in case you run out of your favorite. The tip is too fat to do any natural hair look and you have to go over area many times. Got this in a play box and will never purchase it. I'll stick to benefit and Anastasia.",3
"Don't let the small pot deceive you. This blush is incredibly beautiful in color, blendability and has some serious staying power...even through a 12 hour shift at the hospital. I would like to see a few more colors added. A definite repurchase!",4
"don't quite get it but this stuff works. hydrating, soothing and preps skin for what ever products follow. wish it were less expensive but the spray nozzle (which is perfect) gives a very diffuse spray so the bottle lasts a long time.",2
"Don't think I've ever been immediately impressed with a product. The best 7$ I've ever spent. I even purchased the Olehendrickson Brightning Eye Banana Cream 52$ and it hasn't really impressed me. the caffeine definitely reduces the puffiness and makes my eyes feel so wild awake. It mentions on the bottle to use it AM and PM but I have opted to use the Brightning cream for PM. Just a side note, I have natural dark circles and sensitive skin around my eyes, and I work a day job and a night job and this stuff won't disappoint. Actually looking at sampling everything from this brand.",1
"Double Wear Foundation is unmatched, and it's an incredible product. For me, buying a pump is worth it because I love the foundation. I definitely use the pump over and over again with each new bottle. I used to pour my Double Wear onto my Beautyblender, and I know I wasted a lot of it that way. There was no way to control the amount of liquid that came out of the bottle. Now I can pump the foundation right onto the sponge.  If I choose to apply foundation with my fingers, I prefer to pump the liquid onto my fingers than continually touch the top of the bottle.",3
"Dries quickly and becomes a holographic glittery highlight. Only downside was due to lack of sunscreen and since glitter seems to attract the sun, I got a sunburn wearing it out and about during the summer. So fair warning, put sunscreen!",0
"Dry lips, crinkly effect, application is not smooth.  Colour is pretty but will not wear this because it makes my lips wrinkle up.  At this price point I should not have to put a clear gloss over.  The packaging is extravagant, and I think this is what people are paying for.",2
"Dude. This primer is the bump. The smell is soooooo good. It is so moisturizing and hydrating. It is lightweight and smooth. It makes your skin feel good and hydrated. And hey, it even protects your skin from the sun. Perfect time to get it with the summer approaching. I received this product as a complementary from Influenster for my honest review.",4
"Dusk is a perfect mixture of champagne, light pink and a hint of golden warmth. I'm shocked at how much I underestimated this product. I got the shade Dusk, and it really does have the effect of sultry evening light. I tried it on in natural light and it instantly made me think of the sky when its setting on a summer evening. Perfect for fair - light - light medium skin tones as a high lighter and as a blush topper, or simply just used as a luminous soft blush. I think I'll be purchasing Dawn.",1
"easily the worst moisturizer I've ever used. after you put it on it dries down really fast and within 5 mins your face feels super dry and dehydrated, plus it pills on your face and crumbles right off if you touch your face at all or put any makeup on top of it. trust me, do not waste your money on this.",0
"Easy to apply, clumps a little bit ion the second coat but other than that I really like this product. Lengthens lashes\nIt stays put for o we 12 hours .. doesn’t flake or run at all... would definitely recommend and repeat purchase",3
"eh, just OK. I didn't love any of these or hate them. The consistency of all three was a little off. I prefer Laneige for a mask and have a whole collections of balms I like better. For the price I'd go with some Aquaphor instead.",1
Enjoying this product so much. It is affordable for how fancy and luxe it looks/feels. The scent is fantastic and makes you feel like your skin can take on anything. Never tried an essence before but this has made me addicted to this one,0
even tho it says 7 day supply i only use half a vile which ends up being a 14 day supply its best to use half because it doesnt make a product taste chalky or clump up in yogurts. so i would reccomend using half it does have a very strong herbally taste if u use the whole thing up so dont. USE ONLY HALF,1
"Even though It's volumizing, I had to re-curl my lashes. You get a lot of product in the tube though .  I'll keep trying other products before I decide to repurchase or not.  The Benefit tinted primer kept my lashes curled and I just added a layer or two of mascara for the look I wanted.",3
"Everyone raved about this, which is why I tried it, but really, I see no difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. I didn't think it would make them go away, but I thought I would see some difference....none",3
"Every shade is sheer with just a hint of its color, which is exactly what I want in a lipgloss.  I was afraid some of these would end up being opaque and look like I had poorly applied liquid lipstick.  But I can wear every single color without having to constantly check the mirror.  \n\nThey are also all the same formula as the regular gloss bomb, with a very slight variation in scents.  But all smell heavenly!",2
Every single color is amazing! If you’re a lipgloss fan I highly suggest you give this set a shot! The hot chocolate color is my favorite and an absolute win! Fingers crossed It comes full-size eventually.,1
"Everything about this power is great, for the first few hours. Then, it all goes downhill as it oxidizes. I noticed at work that my face started looking orange in the afternoon and I finally figured out it was this powder. Too bad, because it has a beautiful texture and goes on easily without caking up.",2
"Everything about this product is delicious. The texture is dreamy, the scent is delightfully lemony without being overwhelming.... but I don't think it's all that moisturizing. I have to reapply so many times throughout the day. I now find myself rushing through it just to get rid of it. I'm not sure the $18 is worth it.",0
"Everything in the kit is so cute and so perfect for holiday parties. The kaja blush is surprisingly bulky and stores only one shade with a heart shaped sponge. How cute is that. Violet Voss’s I guess liquid eyeshadow? is sooo blindingly beautiful opaque rose gold. It’s way easier to apply than stila’s. Natasha Denona’s glitter is mesmerizing baby pink and blue sparkles. I haven’t tried them all, but I’m excited to try all these new makeup.",1
"everything you need for perfect skin, I've bought all these in full sizes. the cleanser and moisturizer alone are great products for everyday perfect skin but using the exfoliant a few times a week just really makes a difference in how your skin looks. I love these!",2
"Excellent formulation. You pay the big bucks bc of the quality . Skin glows, evens out and plumps. If you are young no need to bother ,but if you are older and can afford it I would recommend it.\n Royal jelly is always known for its skincare and health benefits. However not all royal jelly is equal and you can't just put it in your face and go. All the ingredients that's in the list play well together to form a beautiful and easily absorbed 'watery' oil. \nThis goes great under makeup and pairs with all the moisturizers I have tried( PeterTR, Sunday R, Estee lauder). Use it first after cleansing and give  it 10-30 mins you can see the difference",1
Excellent product especially for the price point. I put this on most nights under my moisturizer and retinol and it seems to keep me hydrated. A good addition to a fall/winter skin hydrating regime. You really can't go wrong at this price point,2
"Excellent Products and Exceptional Value. I currently live in a very cold climate and I have light skin, and sensitive skin, and I'm no ""Spring Chicken,"" and this line of skin care is amazing. I don't review products often, but when I unpacked this, my eyes popped out of my head with the WOW factor because these are generous sizes and excellent products.",2
"Excellent quality, super soft, effective for transitional colors over larger areas.  Comparable in quality to the big names. I use this brush every day,  and through heavy use and cleanings,  it's shape and quality have not diminished.",3
"Expected a lot from this, since it somewhat compared to all nighter but feel short. Disappointed \nI have combination skin, And do all my preparation before, I tried it several different ways but it still didn’t hold my makeup like all nighter Oil control spray",0
"expensive and amazing! I was recommended by Sephora to use this to prevent acne. my skin was so soft after a 20min treatment. when I washed away the peel, my skin felt refreshing! it was brighten right away, and it was so much smoother to apply serum and moisturizer. I believe it is a very concentrated product of glycolic acid then sodium hydroxide. I m guessing that the amount of sodium hydroxide might have assisted the action of glycolic acid, hence making this product more effective than others I have used. \n\nthat said, Sunday Riley sulfur mask is still more effective for acne treatment. this would be more for regular maintenance.",2
"Expensive? Yes! Worth it you ask?\nI absolutely do! I seriously noticed results the very next morning after just one use! Seriously that next morning my face was extremely soft and very plumped feeling, I was in shock! Not only did my skin (face) feel this way throughout the entire day, this actually made all my skincare products go on like a dream! I knew then that this was going to be added to my everday skincare regimen. Your skincare should be an investment. Find what works for you! Beauty should start from the inside-out. Take care of your body, skin and health in general. Live your best life! Your skincare should be a priority at all ages BEFORE just covering your face in makeup.",2
"Extremely finely milled power, a tiny amount is needed to use on your face.  if you use your normal amount of powder, it will look heavy.  Pick up a small amount of powder, work into your powder brush and tap off the excess - then apply. I normally use translucent powder to avoid that heavy look and the same happens if I use too much.  This maybe a small package, but if used correctly it will do it's job and last just as long as the larger powders sold.",3
"extrêmement déçus la palette paraissait magnifique au magasin , rendu chez moi des couleurs matte trop sec et difficile à travailler et des métalliques qui ne ce voit presque pas où qui on de la difficultés a adhéré et a ce travailler",0
Eyeliners simply do not stay on my eyes. Period. They start to disappear or turn into raccoon eyes within minutes after applying. Then I found this one (after a drugstore brand discontinued my previous eyeliner wonder). This Marc Jacobs liner actually stays put and does not irritate. The fine line it makes is great!! I have fallen asleep with it on a few times and it is still there in the morning. i also bought it in gray. Love it!,3
Fabulous Illuminizer Horrible dispenser great product but the pump bottle dispenser too much product and is horrible trying to get the amount needed I have wasted too much of this expensive product already. Change the packaging and I will give a 5 star for the product is Gorgeous the nicest highlight I own and I have tried lots of different brands including Cover FX which is my go to until Jose changes the packaging,3
"Face lift?  Nope just this product!  Recently I have been trying different moisturizers of mine and this is my latest and greatest.  It has a different feel than most I use...a bit sticky when I first put it on but it goes away. The strangest thing has been happening, my closest friends have been accusing me of sneaking off and having a face lift!  This is the only brand new product I am trying and at times wear it alone during the day.  I am annoyed and flattered all at the same time because I have not had any work done.  I am 59 and trust me, can use all the help I can get.  If I do wear a base on top of this it is Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer however, they have said it when the only thing I have had on was this.  Jury is still out on if this is the cause for my ""facelift"" look but for now I think I will try the BB cream from this brand and see what happens. Definitely give it a try, different things work for different people but I do notice a change with Boscia Cactus Water. I received this in a kit where I picked 6 products if I purchased a certain amount from sephora.  Am purchasing it right now, much easier and less expensive than a face lift haha!",4
Fair skin girl who loves these shadows with impact!  It was brought to my attention that a few pinks are pigments.  That is usually a concern for me and staining.  These shades are so impressive!  Excellent quality.  Does not stain my eyes.  Be careful to place the pigment and build up before blending.,4
"Fantastic array of products that I just love! Benefit's eye brow sample is the bomb. I have one from another kit I bought and it's still going strong! Lasts forever! Love the hair sample from Amika because it works great on my curly hair. I picked a bang of a box for only ten bucks. I will use everything in this box. Definitely well worth it! Plus, I reuse all my boxes from Sephora. They make great craft holders and makeup holders too!",3
"fantastic! Been using this since it debuted.  been through 4 jars, no matter the season,  must have for older women like myself.  I take it down to the decolletage and smooth up to and all over the face.",3
"Fantastic for dry skin. Works great for setting undereye, all over face, and as a stand alone face powder for a minimal makeup day. Goes on very light weight. I got it as the birthday gift as was so impressed I got the full size and gave my other setting powder the boot.",4
"Fantastic... for the first time ever, there's NO trace of makeup when I wipe with toner after cleansing. I have to clean my clarisonic head after because it removes EVERYTHING. Smells amazing! I want to wash more so I can smell my face!  Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, my skin is glowing, I am loving this product.",2
"Fantastic palette with a beautiful mix of warm and cool neutral tones.  The palette is encased in a nice plastic shell.  All the shadows are highly pigmented and blend like a dream, but as usual with ND, the mattes are the real standout.",3
"Fantastic product.  It took off waterproof makeup and waterline liner.  Yes, it sure did and no irritation. As others have pointed out,  I could find a Coconut product exactly like this, with a little research,  and pay far less which is what I will do.  Product is great though.  As I said, no irritation,  took off every bit of makeup before 2nd cleansing, smells great but price is just silly for a glorified Coconut product.",4
"Fantastic product! I was very worried about two patches of dry skin on my face that made my makeup flake. Within a week of using this product I saw a significant improvement on the texture of my skin. By week two, I have no more dry skin patches and no more flakiness.",4
"fast absorbing, leaves skin moisturized and smells great too! it's a ""clean"" product, safe for you, safe for coral reefs, waterproof...it's an all-around amazing product. it applies easily - no thick sticky residue. i use it on my daughter. for body it's an easy spray. for face, i usually spray onto my hand first. i don't think i'll ever use another sunscreen again.",2
"Favorite mascara. It works great for my average lashes after I use a curler. It's on the drier side so it holds the curl very well the whole day and lasts all day without flaking. After the whole day of wearing it, it always looks the same way as when I just put it on. I have never had that experience with a mascara. It is on the harder side to remove.",1
"Favorite new setting powder! I usually use Hourglass setting powder, BUT this is my new holy grail! It lasts longer, covers more, sets beautifully, smooths out my fine lines & pores. I have the color Vanilla, I am Light skin tone & it's the perfect color match for me.",1
"Favorite of a trial trio.   I am 50 with great fair to light sensitive skin, but still have skin of 50.  This eye gel works very well for me - all positive skin response, including a dewy finish that does not accentuate laugh lines.  I've used many eye products, this one a favorite.",2
"Feels great.  Lasts a long time - took about 5 months to use up the whole bottle.  During winter, I use this then layer on normal moisturizer on any dry spots.  Over time, my face has become less greasy.",1
"FENTY BEAUTY....all I can say is; beautiful! I love this collection because of the color and the name too. I am a lover of words and when I saw the name Trophy Wife Life Collection, I knew I would love it period. I ordered it and fell in love with the richness of the pigment and the gloss does wonders on it own, however; I mixed with one of my Chanel glosses and now I get stopped and asked often, ""what color are you wearing?"" I love this collection. Keep doing it Fenty Beauty",4
Fenty Beauty knocked the ball out of the  park with their new hydrating formula. I find the formula to be perfect for mature skin and it really works well with their hydrating primer! I am truly impressed with how lightweight it is as well. The color match is exactly the same as their matte foundation which made it so much easier to pick up my correct shade. The team behind the Fenty brand really does an excellent job with getting things right straight out of the gate! The foundation covers in medium and or full coverage depending on your preference. I also picked up their new Kabuki brush for application and couldn't be happier. OHH and the price is right!,3
"Fenty needs to re-visit the formula. it dries up way too fast while sitting on shelf. \nProduct is great if you happen to purchase from a  ""fresh"" batch I.e. product launch \n\nI re-purchased this as I was sure it would be my go-to. Within the first week the product cracked and flew out of the casing when opening. I assumed it was my fault and purchased a replacement only for the exact same thing happen.",1
"FINALLY an eye pencil that creates the perfect line, smudge, classy, wearable, long-lasting eyeline for both every day and occasion looks. I've been using an eyeshadow as a liner for ages because I couldnt find a better eyeliner product but HERE IT IS. I love the color too - I'm used to using black but this dark brown is actually so much better. I like to draw the line on my upper lash and then use a slanted brush to buff it out. Just perfect.",0
Finally an olivette green metallic that's not gold when it goes on! The colors in this are really pretty and have good payoff. They do have a bit of fallout though. Overall I am happy with the pallet. I'm glad I bought it.,3
"Finally, a strong enough acid that brought my skin to the next level!!! My skin is so smooth and glowing. I barely wear makeup any more.\nI never thought I would ever say that. Over the past year and ever since my teens (I'm 26 now), I suffered from cystic acne, tiny bumps, scaring, and discoloring. I began to incorporate acids into my skin routine with good results but it wasn't enough to control my hormones and my overactive oil glands (I found a prescribed oral medication to help with that). I'm so glad I gave this a try. It is a stronger acid than Drunk Elephant's AHA serum which is great for me because it increases my skin's cell turnover fast enough to prevent any substantial blemish from forming. \n\nI use this about every other night and switch it off with my acne treatments. I always layer a moisturizer on top. I never over-exfoliate. Just listen to your skin!",0
"Finally caved and ordered this Dior Highlighter in 03 Golden Glow and I absolutely love it. Doesn't accentuate texture or emphasize pores. Lovely on oily, mature skin without being over the top! Pricey but worth it after buying a few different highlighters and returning them, this is the cream of the crop! LOVE IT!",3
"Finally found a set that makes my skin feel clean, controls my oil and makes my skin feel soft. It does irritate my skin a bit but that may just be me scrubbing too hard. The moisturizer calms my skin down a bit. May not be the best for people with ultra sensitive skin.",1
"Finally found the perfect concealer!  Youtube makeup artist Ali Andreea brought me to this gem.  I have lots of laugh lines and watery dry eyes, my other concealers were unsatisfactory. This formula is light, creamy, smooth, creaseless and does not break down with tears.  Looks fresh and natural all day.  The tube holds a lot of product and will last a very long time.  \nHowever, it would be SO helpful to have some color guidance from Armani or Sephora.  The 3 shade is very light, a guess on my part. A bit darker may have been even better.  I live far away from a full service Sephora so can't see or try on the premium brands.  Please add information to help with color selections.",4
"Finally got my hands on a reusable crystal file. This can be washed and reused, and works better than some of the disposable nail files I've used.\n\nCase seems super cheap, doesn't close well and feels fragile. I'd recommend storing them in a different case or container if you're bringing it with you on the go.\n\nI bought this in Nov. 2019, and I'm not sure if I was sent an older version, because I received a purple one (not the current pink crystal file displayed in the picture). I'm not sure if the color differentiates between the newest design/version, so take this with a grain of salt.",4
Finally I found an eye shadow that actually stays in place with my oily lids and watery eyes. I've tried so many shadows in the past and by lunchtime they were creased and looked horrible. This shadow is better than other more expensive pallets.,2
Finally I found something easy to travel with with colors I love! The finishing powder is great for light radiance and the highlighters are everything. A little powder goes a long way. I'll continue to purchase.,1
Finally! Something that doesn't break me out. I am almost 57 but still deal with acne. So many products I need for aging cause me to break out. This does not and it must makes my skin look better and I actually go without foundation sometimes and for sure put it on lighter. My 17 year old uses it too. I have already ordered more.,4
"Finally the hunt is over!! I'm in love with this foundation, I have oily skin and large pores and been struggling to find a foundation that works for me. I love that this foundation blends right it and looks so natural. It hides my pores and color complexion is perfect match.",1
"Finally.  Truly healthy makeup!\nI research all my ingredients and this formula is not only healthy for your skin, but Spell is the perfect go to color for me.  I get called Casper at times due to being pale but I hate makeup that gives you a tan or is an unnatural color.  If you have cool undertones and your skin looks pink or reddish, you will love this color.\n\nI use it on cheeks, lips, and eyelids for a perfect no makeup look.\n\nTrick for this brand if you have dry skin.  Apply 2-3 drops of your favorite Argan, Jojoba, or Marula Oil 2-3 minutes over moisturizer or spf before applying this brand to prevent any caking or dry spots.  LOVE!!!",3
"First acne treatment that doesn't burn my skin!\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\nYou're going to love it because it is cruelty-free, lightweight, gentle for all skin types, and it's also made with Bamboo Charcoal, 1% Salicylic Acid and a lot of natural good-for-you ingredients so that you can say Goodbye Breakouts and Hello Hydration. I love it as an acne treatment although it is not the best product I've tried for hydration. You can use this product either day or night but I won't recommend using it underneath your makeup because it can make your foundation oxidize and look dewy (if you prefer to look matte).\n\nThe scent is so woody, herbal and fresh, almost like aromatherapy, so it helps me to sleep better too. Oh! and the packaging is made with recycled plastic, paper and cardboard. YAY!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product #complimentary from @Influenster for testing purposes.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#mermaidlife #OriginsTribe #contest #GlowBaby",0
"First I have all shades. All are fully opaque with initial application. All are filled with twinkling glitter. I wear these as liq eyeshadows. They are stunning & stay-on for hours! Idk, if the glitter used is eye safe so I do use them with caution. Had KVD marketed these as liq eye shadows or even a liner. She'd had a out of the ballpark hit.",3
First impression: didnt like it. Blended blotchy. Went back and read the instruction and it said to use tiny amount. Pat first then blend. It worked wonderfully when using it correctly. Brighten up my under eye without drying. It is not full coverage concealer as t is a brightener.  It is kinda hard to get a tiny amount out from the jar but with this jar it will last a long time.,4
"First impression: Oh! My!!  Has eow factor! This is a huge set. Lots of product. Colors for me are perfect. But the clutch, it is so pretty - pictures don't catch how nice it is. I am so thrilled with this purchase. I love Tarte blushes, shadows and powder. Very nicely done by Tarte!",3
"First-I paid full price for this product, that being said, if you don't wear makeup over it, it is a firming cream that works. However, it pills horribly under any type of foundation-so those that said it works great under makeup-I would like to know what makeup they used. I only use enough to cover the lower half of my face where elasticity is failing me lately and that is where my makeup pilled and balled right off my face. I use it on my neck and I always bring my makeup past my neck so I don't look two-toned-it pilled there also. So I will just use it up when not wearing makeup and will not repurchase.",3
"First let me say C-Firma, T L.C. Framboos, T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial and A-Passioni are game changers for me. I don't mind the price point if it's a good product doing what it's suppose to do. Now for the cons. My Refrigerator leaks and freezes the product with slithers of ice sometimes in the bottom. Which I guess is melting when open and causing the little puddles on my dresser. The Marula oil froze and it' now has white chunks attached to the dropper. I could barely squeeze the retinol cream out of tube since it too was frozen. But for all the reviewers who complained about the retinol packaging and it squeezing out all over the place, I found the solution pop it in the fridge (but not this fridge cause it freezes the products). I don't know anything about molecular formulas for skincare products but I sure hope the freezing and thawing of the product is not diminishing the potency of these products. Because again these products don't come cheap.  I did call Sephora I'm patiently waiting for a call back fingers crossed they will do the right thing and replace. For now I removed the products and the fridge is just taking up space. Lastly because I hate being  a negative Nelly, I reiterate that the serums, babyfacial and retinol creams are my favorite. I almost forgot, the sunscreen is good too. I do recommend you give them a try.",2
"First, let me say that I did NOT receive this in exchange for a review, I selected it and paid for it on my own. I am absolutely obsessed with lip products (gloss, balms, masks, stains, powders... anything you can apply to your lips).  I wouldn't say that I'm super picky about the texture of a lip balm or gloss, but I was pleasantly surprised by this... it's almost like a combination of a cream and a lip mask texture wise. It is not sticky and it is not greasy, and it's also not watery and dripping outside the line of your lips. The color was a bit brighter than the ""baby pink"" description, but thankfully it did not turn fuchsia. After it wore off, there was a light stain that remained.  The scent was very nice and the flavor is extremely subtle... wouldn't even advertise it as a flavor, and it dissipates as soon as the balm is applied. It did not have that unpleasant taste/scent of many petroleum based balms and medicated balms. I will definitely purchase this again and would definitely recommend to a friend.",2
"First let me say  the first time I tried this, it broke me out. I finally figured out the second time around that the key was applying moisturizer after this .  I have suffered from cystic acne for a long time, and especially now with hormonal changes. This stuff has changed everything!  I still get a occasional break out BUT they go away much faster and I dont get them nearly as much.  I follow this with Priyana Hylasilk that i get from my med soa and they work extremely well together. I dont get dry or flake , and as I stated before my acne has improved, my skin looks brighter and my pores are much better.",2
"Firstly, this concealer is just wow. It's super blendable and feels light. It looks like skin. I'm in love with it! However, the shade is a bit dark on me. I wish they would have more shades & undertones.\n\nI received this product from Influencer to review for free.",0
"First of all, I did not think I was serum person. It just seems weird to me. \n\nWell MAN I was wrong!!! the CEO has a wonderful texture and smell. It's the perfect morning wake-up for my face! The Luna oil has a nice smell. I use it at night over UFO serum and top off with Herbivore Emerald. I use Good Genes once a week. \n\nMy skin has never felt so soft and smooth! I'm completely obsessed with the line.",1
"first of all... I don't love the Better Than Sex either. so if you adore that, my review may not help you. I'm more of a high impact volume and length girl, not fluttery lashes girl. I had hoped this would be super awesome without crunchy lashes. But, 1) the wand is too big for me and distributes the formula unevenly; I have large oval eyes so I have no idea how people with smaller eyes would use this. \n2)The formula itself is ok. it lengthens well but I did not find it helped hold a curl at all. I also didn't find it any more black than any other mascara, nor did it fill out my lash line like a good volumizing mascara should do I'd you do the wand wiggle.  it didn't flake on me which was nice.  I had a hard time getting this off without the oily eye makeup remover; micellar water proved ineffective.  \n3) I much prefer Kat Von D's Go Big Or Go Home to this. I have to comb my lashes out after the second coat lest they turn spidery, but it really is dark dark black and a high impact for volume and length. \nfor me, this was ok mascara but I'm going to return it.",2
"First of all, if you dislike the smell of rose then you won't like this set. If you love it then this set is AMAZING! I have dry and aging skin. The only product I'm not 100% head over heels for is the moisturizer. It's not bad, just light. The other 3 products knock it out of the park. I just bought an additional set to stock up.",0
first of all I love that this is vegan and cruelty free. really love this brand for that. this mascara made my eyelashes super fluffy and full looking. \nUnfortunately my only complaint is that it's flaky. tried it a few times and throughout the day would notice black flakes on my face. my mom received some as a free sample and she agreed that she had the same problem.,0
"First of all these shade range is awesome and this is the first foundation that matched my fair skin perfectly. Although it is VERY drying on your skin so I wouldn't recommend for dry skin or everyday use if you don't moisturize. I have combo skin so it works awesome on my oily tzone and doesn't slide off like most foundations. I find that if I moisturize really well everywhere else it doesn't dry me out as much. Overall I didn't like it at first but once I adapted my skincare routine, its really starting to become one of my favorites.",4
"First of all, this set is really great value. One full sized pencil is $34 Canadian dollars and 0.086oz. These mini pencils are 0.06oz, which is 69.8% of a full sized pencil. So that makes each mini worth $23.72 CAD and the set of 4 worth $94.88, before considering the built in sharpener and gorgeous packaging. Speaking of packaging, the pictures on Sephora's site doesn't do it justice! The pencils are housed in a super glittery hard case (not cheap cardboard). There's also the sharpener on the side of the case, which I didn't realized based on Sephora's photos. This is a good move since the pencils don't work well with other sharpener and it would be annoying to have to purchase it separately after buying a set. \n\nAs with all Nars lip pencils, these are very matte but not super drying, and the color lasts surprisingly well after drinking coffee and eating. Of course it does fade throughout the day, but I love Nars pencils since they leave a stain rather than fading in patches.\n\nThe color descriptions are accurate and I think they would work well with most skin tones except Dragon Girl, which is a very in-your-face, blue-based red. I personally can't wear it but the set is still worth it to get the other 3.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like, which goes for all mini pencils, is that it's a little more difficult to apply compared to the full sized pencils just because there's less of the tip to work with, so my lips always touch the unsharpened part.",4
"first off, I am not a red lipstick wearer, more so just nude shades but since I received this complimentary from influenster for review purposes, I did try it. And this looked soo flattering on my cool skin tone. it is a cool tone red. and it is very smooth and creamy! it did not bleed outside my lips. it did last a little bit, however after eating I did have to reapply. it felt luxurious on my lips and I am very happy with the result and color. I have been looking at the nude shades in this formula. only bad part about this is the price. 55$ for a lipstick!? you don't  get a ton of product for that much. So unfortunately, the price is steering me away. but if you don't mind spending that much or can afford too, I would.say this is a decent lipstick. very flattering!",1
"First off I bought all except one but only kept Staflyer, Reverb, Wizard and Televator (currently waiting on Thunderstruck and Razzle). The only reason there was any returns was merely a question of color, I have rosacea so the super bright coppery red and orange red of Rocker and Dazzle didn't suit me at all. Despite this, I have to say all perform tremendously well. I had been looking for sparkly and fun colors that didn't dry out my lips and these were amazing and performed outstandingly well. can't wait to try the last few shades!",0
"First off, I didn't really expect anything from this moisturizer besides that I know it will just hydrate my skin. But after days of using it, I notice a subtle difference in my skin it soothe and calm my sensitive skin, I didn't break out which is a huge plus for me! I put it before my makeup and my makeup glides on beautifully! It's the best moisturizer for all skin types!",4
"First off, I'm a big fan of the SDJ line. I've bought plenty of products from them and wanted to share my love of this scent with my family, so Ive bought different kits for every female on my holiday list. While the signature scent is definitely there, these are like deluxe sample sizes for $24....the candle is much tinier than expected (like a votive), as is the lotion. I almost feel embarrassed and like I'll look cheap gifting this.... I was hoping for the price there would be more product. I'll always recommend SDJ products but I'm not wowed by this one.",1
"First off, I received this product from Influenster, complimentary and did not pay for it. That being said, I like the product, but not enough that I would purchase it in the future because do not find that it makes my makeup last any longer. I like everything else about it though! It makes my makeup nice and dewey. The mist is super fine -- so fine that I spray it close to my face so I can ensure it's actually getting on there. I've used it consistently the past month, and it seems like I've barely used any product. It seems that this will last a very long time even though I spray a ton of it on.",0
"First off - thanks for creating a mask that’s not in a tube or a jar. I feel less messy and more hygienic. \n\nThe mask, I was afraid would be too strong of an exfoliant for my skin, but I had no adverse effect. I wouldn’t say this is the best mask, but it is a decent mask and may take the whole container to see the results or know if it actually do anything. But I’m happy that my face didn’t feel like a desert after and that there was a bounce to it. \n\nI received this product free from Influenster to test out.",0
"First off, the bottle is so gorgeous on my vanity! It’s a clear bottle with floating rose petals in it- definitely looks luxurious and super pretty on my counter. However, the rose petals tend to clog the opening which can be annoying. I poked a bigger hole in my bottle and that fixed the problem. \n\nThe toner itself is really hydrating. I apply it to my hands and then pat onto my skin so as not to waste any product. I think I would waste a lot of product if I were to use it on a cotton ball. This really sinks into my skin and provides lasting hydration for me. I apply my moisturizer on top and my skin looks hydrated and supple. \n\nI would recommend this for dry or dehydrated skin. If your skin is oily you probably wouldn’t benefit as much from it. This product was gifted to me by Fresh in exchange for my honest review.",0
First off these all smell soo amazing and on top of that they are like little miracle workers. I work construction so I'm outside alot and my lips get pretty chapped and this is the first product I have bought that I feel like makes a huge difference in a little amount of time. Like one day of religiously applying it and my lips and they pretty much healed up. Highly recommend!,0
"first off, these are so moisturizing and smell so great. the color from the tinted ones last for a surprising length of time if you arent eating. I'm upset it took me so long to try these, but I'm glad I have 6 to play with now!",4
"First off, this palette is TINY, barely larger than length and width of a credit card. I'm glad I got it on sale. Aside from that, wow. The colors are beautiful, very pigmented, easy to blend. I will definitely use this frequently. Normally shadows with any shimmer break out my lids or make me itch. Not these. I look forward to trying more products from this line",3
"First step to a duo cleans. Very soothing, removes eye makeup, even waterproof, with a few drops. I lightly rub oil on skin then add a bit of water - turns creamy - rub a bit more and rinse. Follow with cream cleanser for duo cleanse. Tried a lot of oils, Amorepacific is the best. Love the scent!!",3
"First, the colors are spot on for light skin (about NC-NW 15). It is hard to find a contour color that is right. The concealer is the perfect color and the highlighter is very pretty. I love that they are magnetic and easy to find among all the other products. Unfortunately, these do not work for older skin. They highlighted every dry patch and made my pores look huge. I have really good skin, very small pores and few wrinkles but these did me no favor. I really wanted to like them but they are not for older skin. Rihanna wants to be inclusive and really changed the way cosmetics companies make colors for a range of skin tones. But, being inclusive means that you are appropriate for all ages, too. A lot of times companies only focus on a young market, forgetting that those of us who are older have tremendous buying power.",3
First the color shown in this picture is way darker than what the actual color is.  It's very yellow.  Besides that cakeless it is not aleast for me.  It's thick and it does have good coverage but before I could even set it with powder it was already looking dry and cakey.  I tried this with different powders even used it with out powder was still cakey.  This concealer is a no for me.  I received this item for free from Influenster's for testing.,2
"First, the packaging is nice. I like the fact that this comes with a pump that way the ingredients stay protected. Spf is very important it helps protect your skin from the sun which causes wrinkles. Spf is important especially with people like me who have dark circles. The sun can make dark circles darker. I used this product under makeup and I love it. It instantly brightened my eyes. This product did not make irritate my eyes at all. A little goes a long way, less is more. I applied the smallest amount with my ring finger that way I'm not creating any premature wrinkles around my eyes since the skin around our eyes is thinner than the rest of our face. I also used a beauty blender on another occasion to blend this out and I really like this method as well. This is 100% mineral sunscreen which will block the sun's rays and not absorb them as physical sunscreens do. This is cruelty-free and vegan. This has several moisturizing ingredients. It also has a super tiny amount of caffeine which will help the under-eye area which reduces the appearance of puffiness.\xa0\n\nIt did not disturb or mess up my makeup when worn under makeup. I do not recommend this on top of makeup. Overall I am very impressed with this product you get a lot of product for the price. You don't need to use a lot and this will last a while. This is not sticky and I like that it's not super fragranced. This is an amazing product. I recommend it to everyone.",1
"First the quality of the mattes good. Bad news is I have every matte shade several times over. The lighter gold foil metallic I have in several highlighters & the deeper olive gold foil metallic  is unique. However, I also have it in several earlier released palettes. So all in all the stand out shades for me are all in the top row. The first light blue shade with blue micro glitter is GORGEOUS! The 2nd mauve pink with pink micro glitter; had me at 1st swatch. Followed by the 3rd red raspberry shade again with matching micro glitter. Last in the top row is a deep red raspberry foil metallic. I kept the palette for those 4 shades! I wished the matte blues had been switched out for a light pink foil metallic, micro glitter shade, or even a cool toned matte.",3
"First the wand and applicator are definitely intimidatingly huge. Second the amount of product on the wand is significant and was a learning process for me. I ended up turning the wand end up to only work with the bulbous end and getting significantly better results with this technique. The product is very viscous and clings to your lashes giving the appearance of thickness.\nIt's very weighty and does give definition.\nIf you are looking for a definite I'm wearing mascara look, this is your product without a doubt.",3
"First things first, I don't ever 5 star any item unless it has blown my mind. And this tinted moisturizer outperformed all other foundations I have used both high-end and drugstore. \n\n* I struggle immensely with finding the right color for my skintone. I have tried and purchased many different types and colors. They all left me frustrated and frankly sick to my stomach. So much money wasted never feels good, right?\n\n* I don't care how much the cost is this primer and tinted moisturizer surpassed my expectations and some. The formula was wonderful, it didn't dry out my skin, which is already dry. It was buildable and absorbed well. A little went a long way. It was the perfect color for my skintone. It is precisely what I look for in a product, hydrating and  illuminating. I want my skin to have that healthy glow. And it did! OMG it did!",2
"First this duo is TINY (deluxe same tiny). The colors are a glitter metallic silver & a blacken deep minight blue. They both have a doe foot applicator. For $12.50 a piece. I wished they were a bit bigger. You pay for the name ""Natasha Denona"".",3
"First time trying this brand and so far I love it. Was in need of a night cream and this was recommended by a Sephora associate. I have fairly dry skin and needed something heavier for winter. I’ve tried so many overall- high end and drugstore brand but nothing wowed me. Most recently switched over from Dr Jarts tiger grass cream which I loved for hydration and reducing redness but it was making me break out in little bumps after a short time of use. Been using this one for about a week and I geniunely felt the difference after the first night! My skin texture feels smoother and overall complexion more even. I love the consistency as well. It’s thick but not too heavy/greasy. A little goes a long way so I’m hopeful that it will last a while too! The fragrance does not bother me at all, and I have sensitive skin. If these results are consistent I don’t think I’ll be switching to anything else! Highly highly recommend trying.",0
"First time trying this! My impressions:\n\n1. Lacquer/glaze type feel. It feels nourishing yet adhered to my lips. It doesn't stay sticky. \n2. Color is true. To the Moon is a cool pink with blue glitter and one coat shows it.\n3. It's minty feeling with no flavor.\n4. It has staying power through my morning coffee! \n\nI am so glad I got this on sale. It has impressed me and stands out from other sticky, sheer glosses on the market.",0
"Flesh3 is more a plum than a bronzed rose on my lips. Since these are somewhat sheer they do pick up on your lip color. At first I didn't get the hype, but this is really a super comfortable, beautifully tinted, balmy lip color.",3
"Fluff'n Glam Collection \n""Run the World""\n\nI always saw Velour lashes at Ulta and Sephora and thought they looked really nice, but honestly I didn't though they were worth almost $30 until I tried them out.\n\nThis lashes are not only High End, but they're high quality too, they're super lightweight and easy to use, you can't even feel like you're using something, because they're really comfortable, but OH GOD! You can totally notice a difference. My only complaint is the lashes band... Firstly, because you can't wear the lashes without eyeliner or you'll see it, the style itself is natural, not a lot of drama, but the band won't allow them for ""naked"" and/or no-makeup makeup looks. It's a cotton band that's supposed to make the lash application easier, and I don't know if is the Velour lash glue or the band, to be honest, but no matter how neat you apply them, they always seem to lift from the corners of the eyes. \n\nAnother thing with the eyelashes band, is that even if the glue doesn't seem to stick to the eyes that much, it actually sticks like crazy to the cotton, making them difficult to clean and of course, reuse. I still managed to reuse this lashes four times, but I already cleaned them so good, that I'll keep them resting for a while, since I don't really have the time to do deep cleansing everyday.\n\nAnother thing is that I can actually compare them to my Eyelure lashes in terms of quality, the cruelty-free Mink feels so similar, in touch and cut, also the band, but they do look different, because they're not shiny as the Eyelure ones and the packaging is way better too. The Velour lashes packaging is designed to be reusable and recyclable unlike the affordable brand's.\n\nSo I do recommend them, but there's room for improvement.",0
Fooled by great reviews. I purchased trial size caramel. I have tan olive skin. It was too dark. Nearly orange. What's worse it had an oily sheen. It was very sheer and concealed nothing. Perhaps I could get a more natural shade full size. But I don't like the greasy texture and it really doesn't work,3
for $25 this mask is a steal. you don't need a $50 mask when you can get this one. I had such great results after just one use and after two more I was so excited and happy I picked this up. I have really stubborn black heads and this has finally helped me banish them! I use it 3 times a week and would recommend highly. excellent price and excellent results.,4
"For 30$ I was not expecting such vibrant colors! Fiji is one of the most intense brilliant colors I own PERIOD, and that's saying a lot. Anytime I want to try something fun that POPS I reach for this palette. I don't know why I didnt buy it sooner!",0
"For 60$, you get 4 small items. And don't be surprised how small they are! The water cream jar is a big bigger than the EOS lipbalm. The Dewy Skin Spray is about the size of a travel Hairspray.. etc. I think you get the idea. Lets start with the cleansing oil.. It smells great but it doesn't take off all your makeup, you'll need the rice powder for that, which, you have to dampen and work into a foam. Apply THAT, then work it into the skin to get the rest of the makeup off. Its alot of work. I could have been one and done with my standard facial cleanser. After that, apply the water cream.. yes its nice.. yes it seems to moisturize.  The next day, wash and moisturize, apply makeup and the dewy spray.. but later? my face has this, layer... of stickiness. I did NOT like that.. I never had it before using these products. I'm not one to over use a product. I think for most, I try to be conservative.  15.00 each plus shipping for teeny items is not a deal. Not sure I'm going to buy any of the full size items",3
"For all those claiming this is drying or irritating, really don't know what you're referring to. This is literally the most gentle face wash I have ever used. Does not dry skin and leaves it quite soothed. The reason for four stars is that I find it too gentle that it doesn't cleanse as well, often left with residue.",4
for context: I have combination acne prone skin and am of Asian descent. I received this complimentary to test and review.\n\nfor pros: it is a high quality product and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and nonsticky. it's winter so my skin has been dry but this has helped with the dryness. I've only been using it for two weeks so far though so I don't know for sure if it has any other effect.\n\nfor cons: the packaging is a little weird. it's like a spout that let's a little out at once. I'm just confused why it's like that. I feel like it's harder to get product out/see how much is left. \n\nalso I'm not sure if it was this or the brightening serum because I started using them on the same day but something broke me out the first week. it cleared up though.,0
"For me, the foundation was a medium coverage. I had to use three of four pumps before I gave up on creating more coverage. I am not complaining. If you have skin that has little blemishes, medium coverage works fine. The foundation did look hydrating. It was not matte of course. It was a bit sticky to the touch. I did not set with powder. My skin looked natural and healthy. I did wear it for over 12 hours. It seemed to last that whole time. I am glad it has SPF 15.",1
"For me, this mask feels very luxurious and truly like a spa. It's texture, at first, is like a gel that turns into oil. With all of that rose petal powder and sugar, it's really unique. It gives me a soft exfoliate and nourishes skin with all of those different oils. Skin feels smooth, rejuvenated and revived!",2
"For me, this Microfoliant was a trial for using Dermalogica's Superfoliant (one-size only big bottle=big commitment). I was happy with my rotation of cleansers (Clarins, Tatcha, Philosophy, Banila) but my wandering eyes couldn't help but pick up on this Allure featured product. I use this product as a substitute for my Suisai Beauty Clear Powder (Suisai started my love of Japanese double cleansing), but find it too gentle/sparse for being my sole cleanser. No breakouts or broken skin over this Microfoliant, I use this gentle exfoliator after products that create turnover (retinol). I think I'll try the Superfoliant next.",4
"For me, this set is such a great value that I'm considering buying another. I love the Luna oil, Algenist pressed serum, the Belif sleeping mask, the Murad eye cream. And I've always liked  Fresh products (I've never broken out) and the Lotus night cream doesn't disappoint. I havent tried the rest but for these 5 I think it's worth it.",3
"For me, unfortunately, this just didn't do anything. I didn't feel any difference in firmness or elasticity from using this product. Which is a shame, because by all accounts and ingredients it should be amazing.\nExtra star for the lack of scent, ease of spread and lack of adverse reactions.",1
"formula  has been revised so it no longer smells like hot buttered popcorn! I am loving Coco Cabana more than the original. It's definitely a mist need to reapply every few hours to keep the scent alive, even when applied over CoCo Cabana Cream, lasts longer when used on hair and clothing but doesn't have the staying power of perfume, which is something I actually enjoy for every day use, I like that it fades and I can choose of I want to reapply.",2
"Formula was ok, good coverage and did not need to be set but the stopper would not stay in place from the day I purchased it and it made a mess everytime I tried to use it. I ended up returning because for a $28 concealer, that should not be a issue.",2
"for price and quality you are getting it is beyond worth it. tartlette tease was the reason I ended purchasing all tarts shadows. the formula is creamy and can become flakey in the tin over multiple sure, but the colours are so beautiful and the texture feels so smooth when applying. by the way it smells amazing!! In love with this mini palete, great for everyday and travel.",0
"For reference, I am NC35 in MAC / N40 in CoverFX. Glace is the perfect, PERFECT, mlbb nude. Hallelujah! Finally, after eons of too-white, too-peach, weird salmony pink, greyish, macabre, barely living dead, 'nude' lippies, I have found The One. The wear time is pretty good, about 8 hours as long as I blot off any excess ip balm before applying this lip crayon. It'll last through dinner as well if I apply it straight from the crayon then, using a lip brush, I massage it into my lips in small, circular motions.  It smells yummy (so important for something that sits pretty much right underneath your nose) and tastes a bit sweet. The ingredients list makes me feels OK about the inevitable nomming it off my lips over course of the day.",2
for someone like me who cannot apply eyeshadows properly ever and cannot figure out what brush ia for what for life of me  this one came  as a boon  these are so easy to apply. total mess free and quick  application  and end result looms like it is done by a pro. i quickly bought 4 more shades but i hope to see a blue saaphore an amthyest and emerald color soon along with a black shadow too. if not doubles  i would ask huda  to release matte singles  in more colors plz  \n\noh and everytime  i have worn this shade i get flooded with compliments,1
For taking off makeup this is the bomb....if your a S.G...lipcolor user this takes it right off along with any other stubborn cosmetics...swirl around on face add little bit of water work into emulsion...then rinse...my go to for makeup removal....,3
"For the first time, I like a bronzer. I have tried Nars Diffusing Bronzer and Charlotte Tilbury bronzer only to be disappointed. The nars bronzer has no payoff and the Charlotte Tilbury bronzer is pretty but it takes a lot to build it up. This is so velvety soft and natural looking. It can be applied as a sheer wash of color or built up to be more intense with ease. I was worried that the color they recommended for my skintone (warm dark tan) wouldn't look right, but I took a chance and it is perfect. I suspect I can wear more than one shade as well. Well done!",2
"For the most part I like this pallette but it is far from a favorite of mine and the formula is good but not Anastasia level good. I feel like with how this pallette is advertised as a travel pallette, it is in desperate need of one or two more basics. The transition shades are lacking with riff and stillshot pulling very warm on my pale skin and weekender being too light for a transition. I wish they had included a shade like Anaheim in the Gwen Stefani, a more neutral taupe. While I have enough in my collection to deal with the lack of transitions, I bought this as a travel pallette and its a bit disappointing as this pallette is presented as an everything in one.",0
"For the past 15 years, I have searched high and low for a concealer that doesn't take off my foundation, cake, or dissolve ...and THIS IS IT!!!!! This concealer is so creamy and wet, blends beautifully, and lasts all day. It is buildable and actually conceals!! I have never spent this much money on a concealer before, but I have zero regrets. This formula is out of this world if you have dry-er skin. So moisturizing and perfect color match!",4
"For the past year I've been dealing with patches of dryness and red pimple-like bumps only on my forehead. For months I figured it was acne and treated it as such until I realized it wasn't going away and wasn't like any acne I had experienced (no blackheads/comedones; dryness; sometimes painful; and really red swaths). At first I thought it was eczema and really focused on moisturizing, but nothing would stop the stubborn red pimple-like rash from spreading. Looking at my skin in better lighting, I realized there were many tiny red veins around the irritated areas, and realized I may have rosacea (I've always had a reddish complexion so this should have occurred to me earlier). This product came up in a search of products for rosacea, and it was so inexpensive I immediately bought it. I've used it for a week and for the first time in over a year, I have seen SUCH significant improvement, I am overjoyed!! The red bumps have gone and new ones have not just cropped up in their place! This issue was really bothering me and I was becoming so depressed over nothing working, I am SO SO relieved to have found a product that helped so much!!",1
For the price I expected the cap to stay on this lip color.  Every time I take it out of my makeup bag the cap is off. It is a beautiful color but does not last a long time. I love Tom Ford products but this is not as good as the lipstick.,1
"for the price, it's a great value set to try all of Bite Beauty's key lip care products. however, the lip balm melted in my pocket very quickly, and the lip mask (tube) is extremely thick! I wouldn't really rebuy any of these on their own, except for maybe the lip mask/balm in the pot but wish it came in a glass container so it felt that little bit more luxurious",4
"For the price that it was, it did nothing. Skin has been getting dry from weather but this didnt really give me any extra moisture for my skin. It didnt irritate my skin so thats a plus. It did smell really good.",2
"For the price, this is a pretty disappointing lipstick. The packaging is plastic and the packaging, formula, smell, color, performance, etc. are all identical to one of my Colourpop Lux lipsticks. Considering that lipstick is almost 5x cheaper, I'm not impressed. I'll stick with Colourpop from now on.",1
"For the price, you really can't go wrong. I got this when it was on sale. This is sheer and perfect to give your lips that ""unicorn"" color change finish. I'm Asian, light to med skin with golden undertone and I wear this on bare lips and is really cute any time of day. I was very pleasantly surprised with the accuracy of the description and performance of the actual product. Super pretty!",4
"For years I was looking for a nice gentle cleanser I did tried almost everything, I have mild rosacea on my cheeks and I saw is made with one of the main ingredients SULFUR which is what my doctor prescribed a sulfur topical cream for my face and when i started using it it was amazing, no irritation, no dry skin at all. This is amazing stuff!!!! Been using this for about 2 years now and I will continue use it forever. It definitely helped my face",4
"For YEARS! Just tried the new Boing & hqave used literally every brand. I always go back to this. It WILL NOT crease if you use quality eye cream, touch of primer & blend well. My 50+ yr eyes look way younger / fresher.",3
Found me my new go to blush.  I've been using Tarte and their blushes for years and in my 2nd attempt to Branch out and see what else may be out there and my search is over.  Not a single negative I can think of about this blush it is flawless.,2
Foxy Brown paired up with Birkin Brown matte lippie and Love Trap for Very Victoria lippie. I must say the hype is real regarding the texture and wear time on these liners. So flipping creamy and glides lovely over the lips. Very happy I purchased both of them I look forward to grabbing more shades.,3
"Freaking Love! This is my first foundation palette for my personal collection. Great addition. It's nice to have so many shades in one little palette. Can be used as concealer and contouring as well. I can customize to any shade to match my skin tone no matter what time of the year, love it! It took me forever to finally cave and buy this. I was back and forth, glad I did. I love the compact size of this and the weight of it, it's got substance. A little product goes a long way, gives a nice build able coverage.",2
"Fresh and light citrus vanilla scent, very light weight on skin. I have sensitive skin and this did not sting or tingle, either. After application my face feels soft and supple.  There is firming action, but it is gentle and does not cause tightness.  I also used it on my neck and décolletage.  I would definitely recommend this as a nighttime moisturizer anti aging product.   Because it does have retinol be sure to use sunscreen. I love the push top pump design ( see photo).  Very easy to use and I dont have to dip my finger in the jar!",3
"Fresh is such a great company and they have done it again with this product. I recieved my Kombucha essence complimentary for testing purposes and i wanted to be able to give and honest review of it. When I first started using it I thought it was going to be a little oily for my skin type but it has really helped hydrate and reduce rough patches I have on my face, I have been enjoying the scent it's very light and relaxing.",4
"From MAC Painterly, UD Primer Potion, to Beauty Bakerie Eyes Cream, I've been around the primer block. I just ran out of my Primer Potion and as much as I like it, I'm not a fan of the sponge applicator. I felt like I had to use my finger to apply it with circular motions so it would create its ""barrier"" and set. Honestly I found this so time consuming. My mom swears by Smashbox's primer and I figured I would give it a try.\n\nThe tube is not easy to squeeze, so there's control in how much you use. You don't need to use a huge amount; less than a pea does the trick for me. Also, I like that there is basically no pigment to this. Like the original Primer Potion that goes on basically like a second skin, this one can more be likened to  a translucent white.\n\nThe formula is not greasy, not drying, sets immediately, and the staying power is outstanding. This could even be worn by itself if you felt like it. I can't see not repurchasing this.",1
"From the first time I used this mask I saw glowing results. It's fast and easy too. And I love that it's natural seaweed ingredients as my sensitive skin does not get along with retinol and other chemicals. Love, love love it! I've already recommended this to my mom and my daughter. You will love it too!",3
"From the last year my skin has look more youthful, plumped and my skin care products gets to fully do it's job due to how clean it is. If you ever get to treat yourself get this. Also the back side really plumps your skin.",0
"Full disclaimer:  These types of products are not really my thing.  I find them to be in general very messy and a little cumbersome.  \nWhit that in mind, I like this one because it comes in a shade that is not golden brown, I am very pail and I while I like the effect these have on people's skin, none have every really been in my ""shade"". This guy, is in my shade,  They also have a few other shades which I appreciate very much.  I also enjoyed that it was not straight up glitter, it left a nice shimmer effect that looked good in the light.  I did not notice it transferring on any of my clothing which I also appreciate.  It did take a hot minute to sink in/dry, that was a bit much for me so this is only a product I will use when I am feeling extra.  Oh, the smell.  If you don't like big smells, then don't bother with this, it has that classic Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum smell which I LOVE so I am all happy there.",2
"Full disclosure: I tried this product myself, (20s, super sensitive, dry skin), and it didn't really do anything. I might have even lightly broken out, but I am not sure if it was because of this. However, my mom (also dry skin, but not as sensitive, and concerns more around aging) used the rest of my samples, and even from across the room, I noticed her skin was plumper, bouncier, glowier, and more even. She stopped using after the samples ran out, and her skin was not as good. She's started again, and now we are convinced this is a miracle product. She has tried every highly rated vitamin C serum out there, but nothing compares to this one. If this sounds like you, I'd highly recommend!",0
"Full disclosure, Sephora Skincare Expert here!\nI tried the Collagen Proteins to try to postpone a knee replacement surgery recommended by an Orthopedic Surgeon. Ten days after faithfully taking three scoops each day, my pain was gone. I kept thinking that I was crazy, but it really helped. It has been almost a year and I still have no pain. And...my hair grows incredibly fast and my skin has become more supple. I cannot say enough about how amazing this has been for me. \nMy experience is that it is completely tasteless and textureless in warm to hot beverages or food. Not so much in cold unless being blended. \nI have shared my story with many customers who have thanked me because they also get great results. Do yourself a favor and try this.",3
Full size lippie full size highlight pallet! For $25 can beat this deal. The wuality of the products is amazing especially the lippy & pallet. I'm not a huge fan of the spray because I have oily skin but ill still use it when my fix plus runs out :),0
"Fun color story.  Nice transition matte colors.  Only two dark colors to create depth.  I find myself reaching for my trusty Viseart palettes to add depth so I don't have CANDY EYES.  The shadows blend well, staying power fades by 8 hours",3
"Game changer! All I can say is these lil dots are amazing, they suck out all the gunk and speed healing. I have cystic acne and had a bad cyst this last week and after the first application overnight, my cyst shrunk way down and the redness was way better. By the 3rd night it was pretty much gone! I will always have these on hand for now on.",4
"garbage! when I opened them they were dry, which was fine whatever. But as soon as I opened the tube the lipsticks fell out!! so I had to mash them back into the tube. they may have great pigment but go try literally anything else.",4
Gave this 5 stars even though I never put it on my face. Could tell that the color I ordered (using Sephora's color matching) was way too light. So sad. When I can get somewhere that has actual samples to try I'm going to give this another go.,3
"Generally anything with a universal tint means not for anyone brown. And that rings true. I was more upset that the Sephora employee told me there would be no gray cast. I looked like I’d seen a ghost, or was sick all day. I returned this right away. Anyway tyra banks or darker need it buy. Stick with murads invisiblur. It costs more but it’s worth it",0
"Ginger Binge is great for everyday highlight, and Moscow Mule is wonderful for an extra glittery glow. On me they're both lowkey colors because they blend so well with my skin tone, but they have enough pop to be noticed.I always get compliments when wearing it!",4
"Ginger Essence is probably my favorite perfume of all time! It is the most sensuous scent I've ever worn (as the name suggest :-). It's bright enough for Summer and spicy enough for Winter. The ginger gives me an instant mood boost. It lasts all day without being too overpowering or getting funky by the end of the day. It is one of the only scents that doesn't exacerbate my migraines. I literally have someone ask me what scent I'm wearing every time I wear it!\n\nI purchased a bottle and only a few months later somehow I lost it during a home renovation where I moved everything out of my home. (I'm still hoping to find it somewhere, one day.) I was distraught. I couldn't live without it! I had to immediately buy it again. And I will buy it again and again, if I have to. I love this stuff!",2
"Giorgio Armani Power Fabric Concealer\xa0is great. It covers well with minimal product. It does not take long to dry, so keep it moving during application.  I wore it for about 10 hours and did not see it fading at days end. I would recommend this concealer but it's a bit pricey.  There are other concealers on the market that are comparable without the designer tax. I must confess it'll still be on my list as a splurge. I recieved this product complimentary for my honest opinion.",2
"Given that I never really used an eyelash curler, I really liked using this one. The curler was great and it didn’t pinch or pull my lashes out which is a huge plus and one of the reasons I gave up eyelashes curlers to begin with. It’s a great natural curl to your lashes. While I would have never purchased an eyelash curler before this before, I definitely love this one and plan to get another.\n\nI received this product complimentary for product testing purposes.",0
Gives a lovely glow. Follow the directions properly and it will melt into your skin. It does not go into any lines under my eyes which is always an issue for me with other brands. Love the skincare benefits. Literally lasts for months. I've had mine for about 6 months now using it mostly every day and I've barely made it half way through the jar. Definitely worth the cost.,0
Gives a perfect glow with no streaks. I even spray my hands and arms every so often. It releases a super fine mist and it isn't a dramatic tan so you don't need to worry about exfoliating or being super precise. I breakout easily and it didn't cause any issues. A couple sprays to finish off the bedtime routine and you're good! Only 4 stars because I don't care for the tropical smell...,4
"Gives a soft natural gleam, great colour, good pigmentation. However... I bought Nude Pop specifically because I look terrible with pink and I was quite surprised to see myself in the mirror after 5 hours. It gets redder and redder over time!!! I'm still giving it 4 stars because I love the baked texture and the initial colour.",0
"GIVES ME LOTS OF NATURAL COLOR, WOW! This really got pretty results. I do not need a foundation for color on my formerly very pale skin. Cause and affect.. Clinique really does not list a colorful flush as a benefit. Hmmm..",4
Gives your lashes the most beautiful natural lift! I have straight lashes along with monolids so I have always stuck to my trusty Shiseido curler. The Shiseido gives my lashes a more aggressive lift and curl while this one gives a pretty natural flirty curl.,0
"Give this product a chance. I have bought a lot of different primers in my day. I have a few favorites, this one being among the top. not only can you not beat the price, it works really well. I have learned that the trick to being successful with this one is that it needs to be applied a few minutes before you later on top of it. It needs to set before you do whatever else you are going to do. If you can get that down, I swear you will love it! I can absolutely notice a difference in my skin when I use it. It smoothed my pores out and absorbes oil through the day. It will help my makeup last ALL DAY. I love it. And for the price.....",2
"Glad I tried the mini first. Didn't see any firming effect, but that's probably because I have up on it after the 3rd application because it pills so badly. Under makeup was a disaster. Even all by itself, on a freshly exfoliated face without any serums, it would pill almost as soon as I began working it in (very light massage to cover everything and patting). Can't even salvage the rest of the mini by just spreading it over and then letting it soak in itself - it just sits on top. It is a nice consistency and not super thick, so not sure why it performs so poorly. I have normal skin with some occasional redness, but have never had any notable skin issues.",3
"Glides on smooth, and a little really goes a long way. This tube will probably last me a year! Medium coverage so I need to dab on pressed powder to cover dark spots. I would've given it 5 stars but the shade is a tad dark for my skin (I'm Asian and the beauty consultant recommended the tan shade). Kept my face dewy and moisturized all day.",3
Goes on smoothly with the perfect amount of coverage (they have stated medium coverage) which I like. You only need 1 -1.5 pumps of product for your entire face. I applied it with my Artis mini palm brush and achieved a flawless look! Love!,3
Good color and consistency. I had been hesitant to try a contour stick as I didn't want to look like a child got hold of make up. It was quick and easy to us and blended in nicely. Clinique is a brand I have respected for a number of years so it make sense that they would create a good product.,4
"good color! the formula is nice, but it isn't all that long lasting. I'd imagine it looks best on paler skin but it showed up fine on my medium skin. tbh there are better blushes on the market!! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0
"Good foundation, it doesnt feel heavy, good coverage. Like the texture. And doesnt have any bad smell, like other foundation i have tried. Recommended. I have mature skin and doesnt mark my line expressions. Definetly will buy it. Influenster send me some sample. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",3
"Good lipgloss, love how it gets rid of all the lines in my lips. Not sticky at all but the packaging isn't the best, as it's very runny and the squeeze tube isn't very user-friendly. Doesn't stay glossy very long though and not a lot of product for the price.",0
"Good moisturizer. I bought it because it's hard to find an oil free moisturizer that doesn't contain dimethicone, which my skin doesn't like. I have sensitive skin, prone to breaking out (have been on accutane). Texture is very silky and keeps my skin fairly moisturized, even as winter weather has begun. Only 4 stars because I think the foaming texture that the cream gets is just a gimmick and totally unnecessary, and I highly doubt it adds oxygen to your skin.",0
"Good product, but not impressed. I was a little disappointed. The morning my makeup was looking really great, but at noon, my concealer was already creasing even though I had a good primer and finishing powder on. So I would not recommand this product for an All day wear.",0
Good product for price. Glides on nicely and suggest to either give it a fresh sharpen or a quick heat. Stays on all day and doesnt smudge. Someone mentioned an issue with not finding a sharpener that fits... Avon has a duo sharpener and I stocked up a few years ago (for lip liners and for eyes) and they work for this liner. I think Avon stills sells it!,1
"good product, I can see small improvements to my skin after over 2mo of use. fine lines are still there but there's an overall radiance.  originally started using it to whiten the dark spots but it doesn't look like it's done anything on that front. I got this as a sample and not sure if I'd go and buy my own bottle when I run out.",3
"Good product, if you dont listen to the instructions. It goes on really nice. It's hard to miss a spot. Its alittle tacky, but that doesnt matter because your going to wash off. But I am pretty fair. I leave it on for 20 minutes. And its takes about three times of use to start seeing something. I just wish the bottle was bigger.",3
"Good product, very hydrating, has a nice scent. The only thing I don't like is that it feels just like lotion cream and that can be a bit tricky for my skin cause it can break me out. The last time I used it I got two small pimples. It might work on somebody else's skin but for me it's a pass unfortunately.",0
"Good quality pump that keeps my Sheer Glow foundation mess-free and easy to dispense. Docking a star because it has to be bought separately. Sheer Glow is expensive and for the price, it really should come with the foundation. Come on, Nars!",0
"Gorgeous! beautiful colors in this palette with a combo of matte neutrals to shimmers and even further, to sparkles. there are so many different looks you can create with this palette, from natural everyday looks to evening to all out GLAM! I will get so much use out of this, I am so excited.  the formual is great, very easy to blend. the staying power if good too, especially with an eye shadow primer.  i have gotten so many compliments when i wear any of these shadows.  Plus the mauve and gold tones would compliment any color. the ONLY thing i hate is the fact that its not a natural makeup/company. otherwise , im a fan. i recieved this palette for free, from influenster, for my honest review.",2
"Gorgeous color and even better applicator. this slightly metallic royal blue/violet lip color is a show stopper. it is beautiful  vibrant, and attention grabbing. if it had one downfall, it's the fact that it comes off quite easily, when it comes off it fades into a sheer blueish purple (almost making you look dead lol) so bring it with you make sure you can reapply often.",2
"gorgeous highlighter! It leaves the most gorgeous pink shift on your face! if your a pink lover this is definitely for you. It is glittery but not so much as the diamond bomb. this is more for going out, concerts or festivals not really for a work day. it applies nicely with a brush or finger (better with finger imo) the only think I dont like is how it looks dirty after you start using it regardless if you have a certain brush just for that highlighter or your hands are clean, same thing with the diamond bomb. The packaging is also very beautiful and high end, even though if you dropped it it might crack like I did the highlighter came away unscathed thankfully but irregardless Its still one of my favorites.",2
"Gorgeous- \nabsolutely beautiful shades.\n\n4 stars only due to the color selection- I imagine using just a partial selection, though they are all beautiful.\n\nI haven't had any fallout issues, one any of the other issues described by others. Will update if necessary-",2
"Gorgeous serum that I have very high hopes for! That being said, I've only tried this a few times and anything that has to do with antiaging definitely takes more than just a ""few times"" of usage to see results. First impressions are it absorbs well into the skin, no tackiness, has a slight perfume fragrance, but nothing strong or lingering! Fingers crossed this makes a difference in the small fine lines I have under my eyes!",0
"Got a deluxe size with points and thought I would give it a shot and am glad I did not spend any money on it. It did nothing. I use all kinds of acids and retinols and also Retin-A. This doesn't come close to Luna or Retin A,  or Kate Somerville's Derma Quench liquid lift with retinol. Over priced because of its brand name IMHO.",3
"Got a free sample with purchase, first let me say the bottle is smaller than my pinkie finger. Secondly it is way too thick to even bother putting on my face as I know it will clog my pores. So I put it on my neck and chest as and I suspected it did not absorb, just left my neck and chest shiny. Besides the outrageous price tag, it does nothing. I prefer the FAB sativa-oatmeal oil to calm my skin after acid peels and derma-rolling.",3
"Got a sample with order of this foundation, I used the 5, which wasn't really a great match but it was okay just to try out the product. This goes on very watery, easily blended out. Extremely light coverage, however it dries down and when it does, dries out my skin causing every pore and crease to look worse.  Used with a primer, don't rub it in as it will pill with primer/moisturizer. Made my undereye look dry. I even topped it with a moisturizing setting spray which helped for about 10 minutes. I like a dewy finish and this isn't it. Too much work for a foundation. Will not purchase full size.",3
"got it as a sample from my last order. That thing is goooooood, I put it first and let it soak and then put The ordinary rose hip seed oil and go to sleep. My skin look awesome, my fine lines are almost gone surprisingly and anything that irritates my skin literally goes away. I used a mask on my face that made it inflamed and as soon as this oil touched my face, it was all gone. Insane. Oh btw you can buy this product in a bundle with another for 80$ which mean you get a second full product for literally 2$ !",1
"Go to daily moisturizer over and over again! I have oily, acne prone skin and this moisturizer is a dream. I've been using it for over 2 years because it sinks right into your skin and has the perfect blend of coverage, hydration, and SPF!",0
"Got the 7 day sample offer and started using immediately. Results are immediate as to softening facial creases (smile lines) and elevens. Sinks right in, no annoying scent, not greasy. I like that it can be used AM",3
"got this as a 100 point sample, but now i want the full size. Layered this as my final step at night. It does feel slightly heavy going on, but not thick and greasy,  and the feeling wears away quickly, as the cream is quickly absorbed. Skin looks so plump and bright and balanced in the morning! I've been getting fine lines at sides of my nose, but they are gone.  The best part, is that it doesn't cause any breakouts on my easily acne prone skin. I've used continuously for about 2 weeks. I wish the full size also came in a tube though, rather than a tub.",2
"got this as a trial size, and it was a really nice serum quality wise....buuuutttt.... it smells exactly like bacon flavored dog treats, it's a rough smell to rub all over your face honestly, I don't know that I would ever buy the full size just based on that smell, when there are so many nice smelling vitamin c products on the market, if you can handle the smell it's probably a great product though",1
"got this because they said they changed the scent. still smells like popcorn to me, just not as strong as the original one. glad I only got a mini. Will not repurchase. Bum Bum moisturizes more to me and Acai is my favorite.",3
"Got this for my husband for a stocking stuffer. He has asked me to order more, lol. chose this over the Jack black bar, since it appeared to be geared more for the body. He  uses it for face and body , which is nice bc it frees up shelf room in the shower for more of my stuff.",2
Got this in a package with Extra Lip Tint and Illuminating Moisture Balm. It was a bargain.\nAs others state it has a thick consistency and best to warm it a bit on your fingers before applying. It is very hydrating and will last a long time even with twice a day application.,3
"got this in light, medium, and tan. coverage changes dramatically between the shades, and the shades were just flipping awful.  I'm a neutral light-medium, but I couldn't even combine these to make my shade cos the light looks like a ghost, the medium had a pink undertone, while the tan had a strong yellow undertone and was definitely tanned.  i would not recommend these unless you know your shade in perricone",4
"Got this in the 500 point kit. I always go for stuff meant for sensitive skin but this is the first one I've had 0 reaction to (no burning, itching, tightness). Keeps my skin moisturized in the winter! I haven't used this long term but so far so good.",0
Got this in the mail yesterday and couldn't wait to use it today. I've only used the top row but so far it's looking like it could be one of my all-time favorite palettes. These are such pretty and natural-looking colors. Great for every day. I'm so glad I got this when it was on sale AND an extra 20% off sale items.,2
"Got this randomly during my last sephora visit. Purchased it solely cause it was a mini and said sweatproof  and I hate smudging, my lashes look super long and full. Gives me a more messy natural look. But dont be fooled when I say natural it still does a great job at lengthening and keeping a curl. Worth a buy does what it claims. I'm definitely going to purchase the full size.\n\nWouldn't say it's the best mascara but I've tried alot of mascaras and I  would add it to my top 10.",0
"Great brow pencil! I've gone through multiples of these and will keep purchasing them! Easy to use, lots of control, and very affordable. ABH used to be a staple of mine but ever since trying this pencil, I have not gone back! Although, I'm not a huge fan of the brush as I prefer spoolies :)",4
great bundle with nice travel size highlighter and primer. only concern being the color of the lip gloss it was very light and pale and sheer when applied. the full size cream makes up for that though.,4
"Great but has some smudging after a few hours. This may only happen to me because I have naturally oily eyelids, but after a few hours of wearing this it smudges under my eyes without me having touched my eyes at all. The mascara itself makes my lashes look awesome tho! Full and long and very dark black. I've been able to avoid the smudging by setting under my eye with powder, but I honestly dont like how that looks on me. So I'll be switching to a different mascara.",1
"Great color and moisture.  Goes on light, but changes to a stronger, baby pink after a few minutes.  I just apply to the center of my lips for the 'popsicle ' stain look.  fInstantly makes my lips feel comfortable.",4
"Great color. I read where people were saying this was darker than pictured. I agree, but not terribly so. It is a perfect color for me. I have blond hair and blue eyes and I am fair skin. The only negative I would say is that it is drying to your lips. Not unlike all of the long lasting matte lipsticks are.",3
"great color, not orange. no smell. goes on evenly if you exfoliate and moisturize according to the directions. and use a mitt! if you have to have your hands in water for hours at a time, prepare yourself for the inverse farmer's tan.",2
"Great color story, colors are true in this picture.  I do use colors in my other viseart palettes to add more depth in some of my eye looks.  This smaller palette does not lack in quality.  The colors are all the same quality you've come to expect from Viseart. I have always used an eye primer and I can tell you after 14 hours there is no fading, creasing or smudging.  \nEnjoy!",3
Great coverage and perfect color match but if you have oily skin it's probably not the one for you. I have combo skin and by the end of a 6 hours day my face was super oily. I want to try with a mattifying primer though.,1
"Great deal on a superior tool. I have a lot of unwanted peach fuzz and stray dark hairs, too. I have bought cheaper tools, used regular razors (not recommended!) and had monthly appointments with an aesthetician for dermaplaning. This is significantly a better  than anything I have tried, except having a pro do it. However, I pay my aesthetician almost twice what this costs for each visit. So, this is the best option I've found. The HA serum included is basically an upgraded sample size. I estimate I'll get about 5 uses out of it. It isn't my favorite right away, and I wouldn't buy it at this time. I will buy replacement blades for the dermaplaning tool. thought. It did very good work.",1
"Great everyday, all-day foundation.  Covers most imperfections as a light to medium coverage.  I typically will rotate between this and MUF, but for me, Fenty wins out most days. Stays natural looking and fresh all-day with no touching up.",4
"Great Eyebrow gel. I used pencils for years until I gave this a try as my eyebrows thinning with age. So easy to use and no crunchy glue feeling. The color looked a little light upon application, but dried perfectly. It makes all the hairs seems thicker. I would recommend for sure!",2
"Great for a Young Teen. I bought 1 on sale for $15 ($18 with additional Rouge 20 % off)  to check out for an easy holiday gift for teenage girls.  The set is a good deal at the sale price of $18  but not the original price of $29.\n\nThe set is perfect for a teenager wanting to try out beauty items for the first time.  This set is super cute.  I love the penguin box and my teen tester approved.  This set is not for the sophisticated beauty mavens, but it is great set for young teens.  \n\nAfter reviewing the initial purchase, I bought another 8 for holiday gifts for the teens on my gift  list.",4
great formula but I found colors to be more orangey than I prefer or would have gotten 5 stars. when I am tan it looks ok but when I am more light it looks orange. but the formula is smooth and blendable,2
Great for thickening and giving your brows a face lift. can look shiny I'd you apply too much. but I thought it's a nice touch to your makeup. and light enough to wear everyday. I would recommend more colors.,2
Great ingredients. Not a great concealer. This did not sink into my skin as good as I wanted to and settled into every line under my eyes within minutes. Also blended very patchy with or without primers..Not dry skin approved... Not worth the price. I'll stick to my Jouer concealer.,0
Great light but buildable to medium-light coverage. (If you have flaws to cover this isn't right for you.) Provides just the right of moisture and the scent is lovely! Four stars because of the price and limited shade selection (somewhere between 010 and 020 would be perfect for me as a year round product.),3
"Great lip balm! I find the smell to be subtly sweet & not at all offensive. I reject that it tastes bad. I find that there is no taste at all. It's very comfortable on the lips, not heavy or waxy. I'll definitely buy it again.",3
"Great little set! My first time trying Peter Roth products. The Cloud Cream may be my favorite moisturizer ever. It has the most interesting lightweight texture that feels like a cool drink of water for my extremely dehydrated skin. The two masks are quite nice too, and reasonable sizes just to try them out. While I'm usually really skeptical of any peel that balls up, the FirmX gel peel leaves my skin so soft. I really have no complaints!",1
"Great, long lasting product. It has a desirable matte finish and it does not dry out your lips. The colors are fun and versatile, a definite recommend for anybody looking to have fun with their lip looks.",4
"Great mascara. Gives very fluttery false lash effect with several layers. I used to use YSL shocking, but when they changed to the shock it just dried up and was so goopy after a month you can't apply it. Even if I use a little of that, I use this or Guerlain on top.  No smearing.",2
"Great moisture, great color, great price.  Much more flattering  than the light pink lippy balms out there. Works for younger and older (like me).  As a comparison, this is more sheer with one swipe than the famous black honey. Quick swipe and good to go to brace the winter.  More colors please!",3
Great ND palette! This palette is great and on par with the ND formula. You can create a variety of looks with this palette or use it to supplement your ND gold palette. I love this and it is easy to use and travel with!,0
"great pallet. I first purchased the medium for my sister, fell in love and picked up the light for myself. I use it almost everyday. live the colors! they are a bit pink tho, so I can see why some ppl dont like that. I have cool toned skin and pinks go very well with me. I loved it so much that I picked up the medium.",4
"Great performance and weight.  Builds coverage and buffs to a flawless finish almost as smoothly as a Beauty Blender.  I love this with the stretchy texture of Pat's foundation, but I also love it with Fenty, which I normally find more difficult to blend.",4
"Great pigmentation, goes on smooth and has a very cool feeling when applied. Stays wet for quite some time and allows you to work with it without drying down immediately and leaving you stuck with something you didnt want. Can also be blended out to a shimmer as well or used as an eyeliner.",1
"Great primer with a smooth texture. It has a nice matte finish and holds up well over the course of the day. I like that it isn't too heavy or thick.\n\nI received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review, but all opinions are my own.",0
"great primer, works very well and application is nice and smooth. The only drawback with this is that if your skin is the slightest bit dry, it will give you patches of dry skin after a few hours...  gave it to my sister who has oily skin",1
Great product. A tiny bit goes an extremely long way. Saw a big difference in my oily dehydrated skin in two days. Skin was plum and smooth. makeup looked better and wore well right after my first use.,4
"Great product for sensitive skin.  The toner is very light and smells wonderful- If you like chamomile!  I noticed a significant difference in my skin, although I was cleaning my skin, it was not getting rid of all the impurities until I implemented this toner. I use in the morning and at night.",1
Great product for the price. Really cleans and love that it  has the added glycolic acid. The pump really works great and is smooth when trying to get the product out using wet hands. Stings a little when first starting to use it but I assume that means it's doing it's job.,1
"Great product! Highlights beautifully and keeps shadow in place. Plus I saw 50 cent shopping at Sephora while I was buying this primer, which I would pay $24 for alone. So ya it was well worth the price.",0
"Great product however not sure I would buy again, as I would like something more full coverage and felt like this was a bit sheer. So it depends on the look you are going for. I also found that during hotter weather temperatures this product wasn't as effective.",4
"Great product,  I felt it works great.  Great price and I used nearly the entire bottle and though I'm not a huge fan of toners, this may be something I'll consider buying.  \n\nI received this from influenster for reviewing purposes..",2
"great product.  I get thicker longer lashes, and no clumping or flaking.  this product washes off with water.  I dont like scrubbing my delicate eye area, and like a mascara that is easy to remove.  I have used this product for years.  I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one.",2
"Great product!  I like the color and the consistency, and I keep one of these in my bag for work, one in my purse when on the go, and one at home.  It  makes my lips feel hydrated without being sticky, and the color is perfect for everyday.",3
"Great product. It blends well and I don't think it creases much or makes my fine lines more pronounced. It does a decent job covering up my dark under eye circles. I think it could have a little better coverage but my undereye circles are quite pronounced and for $4, it does a great job and I've bought the product multiple times.",2
"Great product!\nI don’t know if it supposed to be very foamy my wash  dispenses as some bubbles and liquid wash.  I actually prefer this so I can control the lather.\nThe wash its’ self is perfect for my type of confused skin, dry sometimes, red, irritated you name it I have it- oily at times occasional breakouts etc.\nIt doesn’t strip my moisture level and it cleans beautifully.\nThe scent is the signature Belif with tea tree added. However the tee trea is not overpowering.\nI don’t have acne so I cannot address that issue but this a great deep cleanser that does not have harsh chemicals and gets the job done without overdrying your skin.  \nIt actually has helped keep my skin more balanced- moisture level consistent, not dry.",3
"Great quality set! The bristles are soft and don't fall out after washing.  The pouch keeps them protected and is great for travel.  The powder brush size is nice and big.  Love the small smudge brush, already in my everyday makeup kit, along with the dual ended eyebrow spoolie/wing liner brush. The crease blending brush has a perfectly pointed tip to get precise.  Priced to sell. Took advantage of the holiday promo and saved an additional 20%!  Early present to myself.",2
"Great serums I here. Perfect travel sizes. I'm giving it a low rating because I was most looking forward to trying the Bum Bum cream, but the container WOULD NOT OPEN. I tried. My husband tried. So annoying.",1
great set you definitely get your moneys worth the deep hydration alone which is a full size cost about 45 and the toner is 25 so that right there plus the other items its a definitely recommend and must have and i absolutely love my set and all the items will last me a long time especially the deep hydration moisturizer,2
Great shades and very comfortable to wear. The gloss is also a nice addition. These wore well for hours and did not dry out my lips. There was a tiny bit of colour transfer on a coffee cup but I'd prefer that to having my lips turn into dust with a liquid product.,3
"Great value for 5 quality eye brushes   brush bag! TIP: Yes the angled brush may come super stiff out of the box, you just have to bend it back and forth a bit to break up the stiffness. You'll use every individual brush in this set! Might even buy multiple sets for my freelance kit",0
"great value, I bought this during the holiday event with 20% off, the amount of product you get in the retinol and proteini is worth it alone, even without the discount.  those two products alone are worth the$ the cleansing balm works well,  however I find it doesn't just rinse off easily, I had to use a face cloth to wipe it away. the other products are nice also.",4
"Great Value! I have wanted to try out more of the rose products as i LOVE fresh's rose mask. so far the cream is awesome, and i am very excited to try the toner which i am sure is just as lovely. my only complaint is that I wish it was the full rose set... no soya face wash... instead a larger rose mask would be nice!! overall i would highly recommended (even if just for the cream) makes a lovely gift too",1
"Great, well planned palette for the price.  Good quality pigments.  The whiter highlight color is actually more lavender (shimmer) and is lovely.  Do note, the colors on the right side of the store image are much brighter than in person (due to the photography lighting).  I'm buying another as a gift!",2
Had 2 of these. I have very oily eyelids. Old formula was good. Still had a little creasing after 12 hours sometimes not. I work long hours and sometimes go out at night and need my makeup to last. New formula is watery and creased quicker. Only reason why I bought a 2nd cuz sephora was out of literally ever other primer except this and I live 2 hours away. I have to touch up the creases a few times but wish I didnt need to because that means constantly checking to see if my eyelids look bad. I have trouble blending eyeshadow with this primer often. I need to put down a nude base shadow before blending in darker colors or else it gets patchy and won't blend unless I wipe it off and restart -_-,0
Had a facial once in August and had this done. I was obsessed with how my skin felt and looked afterward. I bought this hoping it would give me similar results and it surpassed my expectations. Easy to use and my skin feels so good. It has a really nice weight - heavy and not cheap plastic feeling. Love it.,1
"Had I read the description, I would have bought these a long time ago. Just incase you haven't read it.. these have a diamond dust coated grip. I have had all the big names over the years, several Anastasia's, Tweezermans of all sizes, Sephora brand, Drugstore Revlon and various other ones from stores and online and they have all dulled out, lost their grip etc. Having tried so many.. these Benefit tweezers are just the best tweezers on the market, in my opinion. The diamond dust coating on these is the major selling point, you never have to worry about them losing grip or have to send them in like Tweezermans to be sharpened. They coat drill bits, other hardware and nail tools with the very same diamond dust for a reason. Oh and the brush is really great for people with unruly brows.. It works well for using bar soap and brow wax to lay down the hairs that stick up and all crazy.",1
"Half these reviews are people who didn't use this correctly! If you look under ""how to use"" on the product page, you'll see this product requires that you dont use a primer (but DO moisturize), and then set it with a setting powder. After following these steps, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION. I have dry skin, and I had no problem with it accentuating my dry or problems spots. It is very full coverage, and I didn't need to do multiple layers like I normally would with other full coverage foundations. I love the natural finish of this, especially paired with my Laura Mercier glow setting powder, I felt like my skin looked like it fell from the heavens! Try a sample, or trust you'll love it and buy it, if you like the qualities (full coverage and natural finish), then you'll love this!",4
"Hands down, my favorite eyebrow pencil! Yes, there are really good dupes out there, such as the Maybelline, however, this product is not patchy and when combined with their 24 Hour Brow Set, it will last all night and day!",2
"Hands down my favorite eyeliner of all time! It dries down matte and will stay on all day no matter what- I'm a nursing student and can attest to this!!\nI have had the hardest time finding eyeliners that don't smudge or come off during the day, this one will last me my stage, work and then going out at night. Best eyeliner ever!!\n100% recommend!",4
Hands down my FAVORITE lippies. The shade options are perfection. And they're so long lasting! I can use the same color everyday and it still lasts for months! I own about 20 different shades! The applicator makes it so easy to line and fill my lips. The formula is so creamy and easy to work with and blend. Just be careful not to go over it once its dry. And be sure not to put your lips together like you do when you apply traditional lipstick.,2
"Hands down my favourite mask. I think I'm on my third or forth bottle now. \n\nThis is part of my at-home facial I perform biweekly. I steam my face first (usually with a camomile loose leaf tea infusion to add a little extra extra), use this mask for 10 mins and follow up with FAB vitamin c jelly mask. My skin feels and looks so renewed after each treatment.\n\nTwice a week, I'll use this as a spot treatment, focus on my nose. I just started this a few months ago - I'm noticed that my pores have cleared up a lot since introducing this step.",1
"Hands down one of my favorite moisturizers! I love the gel-like formula! It hydrates so well, but does not leave you feeling oily or sticky. And it absorbs super fast! It works well for those of us who live in hotter climates with high humidity!! A must have!",2
"Hate it. goes on super clumpy, and it's very messy.  when you go to comb out the clumps it comes off in one stroke. after combing out the clumps, you have to reapply as all of the mascara has come off. I'm glad I got this for free and didn't waste any money.",1
Have been using the Glow Booster for about a week now. Cannot give it enough rating stars!! Makes my skin glow and look youthful. I love everything from the Dior skincare line but this stuff is truly amazing! I will never go without it.,3
Have been using this duo for a bit over a week and a half and love them both! my skin feels great and hydrated which is what I was hoping for going into colder weather. I will definietly be looking to repurchase this duo.,4
"Have been using this for around 2-3 months. I have deep brown skin with darker hyperpigmentation and it has cleared up beautifully. I still have some light marks that are still on my face, but I haven't had skin this clear since I was a kid. I think I still have half a bottle left and I use this 3-4 times a week.",0
"Have loved Clarins and used the products off and on for many years, They've always been excellent, so I'm surprised how awful this facial sunscreen is.  Greasy with a strong odor that irritates my eyes.  I plan to return this with a complaint and hoping I can exchange it for another brand.",3
"Have purchased this mascara regularly for the past several years - they've changed the packaging and the brush since the last time I bought it. The brush is no longer the tiny brush I loved, but something slightly smaller than a standard mascara brush. Doesn't do much to grab my short lashes anymore, and takes a bit more effort to work the clumps out. Perhaps the formula has changed as well? I've noticed a bit more smudging under my eyes, and that was never the case with Defincils previously. Looks like I'm back on the search for another holy grail mascara.",0
"have this in sea goddess and hibiscus. it's pretty matte. loreal discontinued my signature color sea fleur, I know, cheap stuff but loved that color so I'm always on the hunt for something similar but the sea goddess was too purple if applied too heavy. if applied lightly I do like it but still on the hunt.",3
Have tried this palette out a few times and am always pleasantly surprised out how lovely the shades look on me. will like to play with this palette more often. Fits in with my more daring days as well as everyday looks that won't be boring. Very happy with this one.,4
"Have used this product for years, there isn’t a product on the market that comes even close to Turnaround.  I love this product, it makes my skin glow, I receive compliments almost daily on how beautiful my skin looks.  Turnaround has been my mainstay, I strayed but realized my skin looked dull, it only took a few days for me to see a difference again.",3
"Having played with this product for a few days now, I have mixed feelings. \nPros: The color (Torrid) on my light olive skin looks fresh and natural. It doesn't sit on top of the skin but sinks in, leaving a soft finish. On my combination skin, it lasts all day. \nCons: The learning curve is steep. It takes a fair amount of practice to apply it and build it effectively without veering into clown territory. The liquid is runny, and it's hard to dispense just a tiny amount. I pump a drop onto my left hand and use a brush to apply -- then I have to wash the product off my hand; so this is messier than typical blushes. The packaging isn't travel friendly. \nOverall, I'm not sure the benefits override the inconvenience and extra effort. My Kevin Aucoin peach cream blush creates nearly the same effect and is super easy to use. I can see why some love Nars Liquid Blush, but I probably won't repurchase it.",3
"Having very oily, acne prone, textured skin, this foundation is perfect for me. It's matte and full coverage while being completely comfortable. I'm on my first bottle and already bought two backups. Highly recommend!",2
"Heard all the hype, read all the reviews, threw my money at it. The instant i put it on i hated it. The coverage is waaaay more than medium, its hard to blend, super cakey for how oddly thin it was, pilled and did weird textural thing after a few hours, and the SCENT just never dissapated. Even though I hated it, i tried it a few more times over the course of 6-7 months. Once when my skin wasnt overly dry, again with just minimal skin prep, when i had no breakouts, and then with ultra moisturization. Spoiler, it was still the worst thing I have ever used. Just use an oil free SPF under your foundation (that has no spf) and you wont have any of those weird pilling, flaking issues.",0
"Here is yet another innovative product from Volition! Seriously, how!?! I spend my entire life in front of one screen or another and no matter how good my skincare routine is I'm still doing damage! This is my new favorite companion! Super easy to use throughout the day for maximum effectiveness. I never feel like this is too oily for my skin and I honestly didnt know how much I needed something till I tried this mist. Simply put, I can't live without it! I'm trying to keep this skin glowy and young FOREVER and the Screen Time Hydrating Mist is here to do just that! Here's to endless hours scrolling on IG and never having weird lines because of it!",1
"Hey everyone! So I haven't written a review on anything since approximately 2011 so this is a big deal. If you at all suffer from redness, especially Rosacea skin, or even just sensitive, reactive skin I highly recommend giving this a try! I developed Rosacea on my nose that has been VERY persistent for almost a year now (over here looking like Rudolph) and this cream has almost completely cured it. CURED. I'm in shock because I've only been using it for a week. It doesn't irritate my skin, it doesn't leave any weird residue, is very calming, feels silky on application, and also smells nice and neutral. The consistency is kind of thick, but not in a greasy or gross way, and it absorbs quickly and I've been using it twice daily. It did everything it said it would and I haven't been this impressed with a product in ages. My skin type is pretty dry and sensitive for reference, like I can't just throw anything on there and see how it goes, so the fact that I've seen such a POSITIVE change with this product is pretty astounding. So in conclusion, if any of this sounds at all like you then get this cream in your life immediately.",1
"Hi! These brushes r so good, as they made me to write a review for the first time in my life.This is a great set for eyes. These brushes work so well that I'm thinking of buying another set. They r great for any eye look. They actually made my eye makeup so fast and easy. I strongly recommend.",2
"Holo at Me is beautifully glittery, like all Fenty body glitter products. The pink shade is lovely! Sadly it is definitely not in the same class as the first diamond bomb; that stuff feels like silk and applies like fairy godmother magic. I was hoping for a pink version, but maybe the color just changes the formula too much. Still worth buying, imo.",2
"Holy Grail!!! I really really thought I had found my forever foundation in another brand (starts with an L)   ;)  At first the consistency threw me off as it is really thin. I thought there was no way it could cover up my skin issues. I was wrong.\n\nFirst, I have horribly oily skin. Constant touch ups all day. With this foundation NO! I have large pores around my nose and with a touch of primer and this foundation they are hardly noticable. I also have rosacea so I do color correct with UD green corrector before applying  (btw amazing to hide redness). I have acne along my jaw line and it completely covers it combined with the UD green concealer. \n\nI guess no one has to believe me but I am amazed. It has very buildable coverage which I love. Totally natural looking not cakey. \n\nThe pic I have attached to this review does not have a filter... this is just another stupid day at work.",4
"holy grail moisturizer! it goes on smooth and absorbs well especially if you pat it in. calmed the bumps I had on my forehead and in combination with the blueberry bounce cleanser, and using the avocado and watermelon sleep masks every other night, I've avoided my normal hormonal break out entirely.\nI have very ""picky"" skin. everything breaks me out or makes me oily. this did neither and it's been almost a week. I have seen a calming effect and it leaves you with a nice bouncy glow after. \nmy only complaint is packaging. it either needs a spoon or just...some other kind of dispense method to get all of it. I also feel like I have to use a lot compared to other moisturizers.",1
Holygrail product so far. Lifelong sunless tanning user. I first use an exfoliating cloth w Charcoal Soap & Amorepacific Treatment Enzyme Peel Powder leaving it on 5-10 minutes in shower. For face mix w Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer & for Body mix tan drops w Yu•Be Moisterizing Body Lotion. This will last as forever on me as long as I reapply every 5 days w as needed touchups like shaving.,2
"Holy grail ! So many foundation mostly can't match my skin tone. Always get 2 shades to mix that including highly claim Mac. Clinique even out foundation with 50 shades useless, even all my friends says that to. Went to the store to colour match 255 matches fantastic. M with warm yellow tone surprise and hesitate to use . Surprise it works fantastic. That's my colour. Wow..... fenty good Job . I'm mac NC 37( which is alittle pale on my skin). Nothing matches in mac either. Cover up with light bronzer",3
Holy heck! This Lip Oil is amazing. Influenster sent me this product free to review. I was a bit skeptical because most lip oils are a super slippery mess of oil. This Lip Oil is thick & lush. It doesn't slip & slide all over the place. It feels nourishing & not greasy. It absorbs so wonderfully into the lips & leaves them feeling super soft.,1
"Holy moley! I've always thought that anyone who claimed a product took ""10 years off!"" was just feeding you a line. However.....about 7 days after starting this eye cream I was spouting just that! I'm not exaggerating and I have no vested interest in this cream or its company. After the first day or two my heavy undereye bags and dark circles were gone! After another 7 days I woke up that morning to a face I literally hadn't seen in 10+ years!!! Even my husband noticed (and I'd be surprised if he would notice if I'd grown a second head) and said: ""Wow! Your new cream did that?!?!"" I was beside myself. The best part-- and I still can't believe I'm saying this, but-- even my hooded eyes were gone!!! I was hooked! And I began trying to figure out how to pay for this amazing cream for the rest of my life.\nSo here comes the bad news..... \nAfter walking on clouds for a few days I started noticing extremely dry spots around my eyes. After a few more days it turned into an entire ring of red, dry skin around my eyes-- exactly where I was using my R.N.A eye cream. I looked horrible. At best it looked like I'd been burned by a pair of binoculars. So, sadly, I stopped using the R.N.A. eye cream in favor of a more moisturizing eye cream. After about 10 days, the dry skin dissipated. But my bags, dark circles, and hooded eyes all returned. :/\nSo now I'm thinking about possibly alternating the two for, hopefully, the perfect eye cream routine. I'll update when/if I get new results. \nI'd recommend this product but advise a sample first-- and to keep plenty of moisturizing cream on hand (just in case)!",3
"Honestly, I added this just to get free shipping, haha.  I figured at the very least, my 3 year old would love it.  We both used it for Halloween and I was really surprised! I applied mine to my cheekbones and my daughter got cheekbones and hair.  It was easy to apply with minimal mess (totally expected way worse with loose glitter) and lasted all night!  My daughter literally  tried to rub it off at one point and barely moved it, hahaha.  Removed very easily with a makeup wipe and most of the glitter in her hair brushed right out.  The pots looked a little small at first, but I coated us like a deranged unicorn and we barely used any out of the pot, so it will last forever.  The adhesive alone is worth the price and good quality.   \n\nTotally surprised with this little add on!",4
"honestly I bought these with my daughter in mind\n shes about 12 years old. anyways, they are very cute for children but for 37 original price, compared to the 18.50 I spent today on them. it's still fairly pricey for what's given. they are good for kids. that's it. the gold one is pretty cute but, that's it.",0
honestly i dont get the hype.. i have been looking around for a good eye cream so i thought i would try this highly rated one.. wow. really nothing special!! i hate when creams cause milia especially around my eyes... i started using it as a lip balm. waste of money. would not recommend!,1
"Honestly, if you're looking for an all in one product, this ones great. It feels very moisturizing and velvety on the skin and makeup sits really well on top. It makes my skin feel hydrated throughout the day and I feel a little less oily than usual. The high price tag makes me want to like it less, but I can't argue with the results. If you like to invest in your skin, this product feels worth it. I was given this product by Influenster to test out and share my honest opinion.",0
"Honestly, if you're looking into buying eyelash glue, pick this one up! Your fake lashes aren't going anywhere.  With this glue, I can confidently go to the gym for a sweat sesh after work and know my lashes won't pop off. \n\nThe trick to the longevity of this glue is allowing it enough time to get tacky...like 3 to 5 minutes while you finish the rest of your makeup or work on getting both of your winged liner to match. :-)\n\nI do prefer the black glue as it helps hide the lash band of lashes like Ardell or Kiss. If it doesn't matter to you, the clear version works just as well.",4
"Honestly I haven't used the products yet, but I have used Phoenix before (full size) and I was considering purchasing it, so this whole box was the great option for me to have try other oils and have my beloved Phoenix again. I am about the purchase my second box because sample sizes are quite generous for oils, considering you need couple of drops, and with the second box, I can have good amount of each product to last for months and if not, these could be nice gift for friends. In summary, if you haven't tried HERBIVORE products, this is a very good option for you to try most of their well known oils and serums OR if you like the products and would like to have them again, I'd definitely purchase two boxes since there will be enough products for each of them just over $100. I am adding a picture near a lipstick so you can see the size of the bottles.",2
"Honestly, I'm disappointed. Don't get me wrong - the quality of these eyeshadows is amazing, however, I do not like the colour story. They all end up looking the same on my lids. It especially hurts when you consider the price of $86.\n\nColours on their own are great, very pretty. Makes for a great taupey/bronze Smokey eyes. I consider only 2 out of 6 to be special. \n\nIf you do not have taupey eyeshadows, I would say you will like this palette. It would make for a good every day palette. Since, I already have similar colours, I regret not returning it.\n\nI also have Bronze Ambition and I like that one more. Platinum Bronze simply doesn't hit the spot.\n\nTook two stars of for colour story and price. I would put 3.5 stars if I could.",4
"Honestly, I'm SO THANKFUL to have found this product. I struggle to keep my sensitive and rosacea-prone skin even, hydrated, calm, and clear. I especially struggle with moisture and calmness because I use Differin and occasional BHA (Paula's Choice) to keep inflammation and acne at bay, which can leave my skin dry and a bit irritated. This serum INSTANTLY hydrated and calmed my skin. It just felt...comfortable, and looked even and balanced. Highly recommend if you have sensitive and dry skin!!",0
"Honestly, I was so excited to try this, because I love Better Than Sex, and thought more drama, more volume, this is gonna be awesome!  I was wrong.  it is not.  It makes lashes clumpy, and the brush is difficult to use.  It's large size is cumbersome and the bristles collect way too much product. Even after removing excess, it's kind of a nightmare.  If you are very very careful, very very light-handed, and take your time you can get a good look, but who wants to spend 3 hours putting on mascara?  It's not worth it, just buy Better Than Sex.",0
"honestly love this. i bought a lighter one i should have gone with the medium tan but it still worked. i would put it on when im putting on makeup. if i wore it for a couple days straight i would notice a difference under my eyes that my dark circles were looking better, lines were less. it looked great and worked great. it last a longgggg time. a little goes a long way. dont smudge it on, you want to pat it on.",4
"Honestly not impressed with this product at all. Strawberries are my favorite fruit, so I was super excited to try this. One whiff of this, and I couldn’t put my finger on what the scent was. It definitely didn’t smell great. I figure it has more of a scent of cucumber, which is my absolute least favorite scent. On top of that I would have not paid the $38 retail price, especially since it doesn’t seem like the cleanser really does anything for my skin.  I received this product free for testing purposes.",0
"Honestly, not my favorite. All the colors are very pale, which makes me look ghostly. The formula is dry as well, which is not specific to these mattes. I had hope for the lip gloss but the glitter in the formula made it slightly gritty. Overall, would not purchase.",1
"Honestly, what is this? I use eye cream to deeply moisturize my eye area, I don't even know what this product was doing. I finished the whole tube hoping to see some cumulative positive change-- but it was disappointing form beginning to end. I would have been better off putting baby lotion on my eye area. There was no 'dewy' effect and in fact, my eye area may be worse off now because I don't feel like it was appropriately moisturized for the two months that I used the product. I use another Dennis Gross product, a serum, that works wonderfully-- which makes the poor performance of this eye cream all the more surprising. I would have returned the empty tube if it wasn't a completely tacky thing to do. Do not buy this item.",0
"Honestly y’all, I didn’t like this at all. Which is extremely disappointing because I absolutely LOVE the Bum Bum Cream. At first the Samba Foot Fetish Cream smells good but if you use more than 1/2 a pea size it smells rancid. I have extremely dry feet right now (mainly because I didn’t have the money for pedicures due to being on maternity leave) and this system doesn’t even crack the surface. The board barely works before or after you wash it. I’ve been using this product a couple times a week without any results for roughly 3 weeks now. I’m so upset!",0
"Horrible!  I don't usually buy products made in China but I was intrigued by the jelly texture.  Boy, was that a mistake!  I didnt have an issue with the mist but I did have an issue with the dispenser...it clogged and it pretty much made the product unusable.  I'm going to stick with my UD All nighter .",2
Horrible...the liner came out and I found it on the floor... that shows me just how much was in the container which is hardly anything for $24 then it’s hard to put on when I try to sample it went on fine I get my pencil and it’s hard hard to put on Indian waxy I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody in the reason why gave it one star is because the color is universal I don’t recommend however I do see that it has great reviews but for me not so good I will never buy,3
"How does this eye cream get so many good reviews. I got this because this contains retinol. but, when I receive the item, on the whole package it doesn't say it has vitamin A in it at all. it just says it has vitamin C and E. And!  I have never used an eye cream so drying! it doesn't have any hydration effect at all. it feels like putting wax on my undereye area. Because it's so drying it made my eyes red and get many fine lines. Reconsider this if you trust this brand like I did. you'd think a bunch of dermalogists\n can make things better than this.",1
"Huda apparently changed her formula but I can't say it's all good changes. She now is also apparently making product in China in which sourcing and production is incredibly cheap, so I don't understand why her prices are so high. This palette has a beautiful color story, and some swatch nicely. I decided not to keep it, however, as it's not worth the price in my opinion. I'm disappointed with the direction in which Huda is going.",0
"Huda's brand does a great job with these more unique formulas. Nebula is such a beautiful glitter that honestly feels like a normal eyeshadow. A little bit of glitter glue and she sticks like an absolute dream, and is way less gritty and texturized looking on my eyelids. I would like to point out that yes, some of the shades aren't as pigmented, because they are toppers, (""two sheer, multi-reflective shadows""). I think we live in an age where if things don't swatch well and if they aren't blow-your-socks-off pigmented, they're considered bad products. Not every product is meant to be used the exact same way.  The color scheme in this palette is beautiful, and I get compliments every single time I use it.",0
"Huge favorite of mine. I use it daily in the shower after I was my face. It makes my skin soft and smooth, as well as receptive to other products in my skin care routine. Worth the price - it lasts for months.",4
huge!!! fits anything. i had two disney x colorpop collection set boxes that i have had setting out for months and i did not expect they would find a home but the bottom drawers are larger than they look.,0
"Hum Nutrition really works. I use several of their formulas daily including Gut Health,  Skinny Bird and the daily vitamin with iron. I saw this set and had to try it, it is difficult to find gummy vitamins that are vegan. these taste great and are convenient. Too soon to tell if they are working but if they perform like other HUM vitamins I will be very happy.",3
"Hydrating and radiant, lets a nice shine remain. There is no glitter, I dont know what some reviewers are talking about. I got this in an Ipsy glam bag and will buy the full size.  I checked the full size ones at Sephora and there is no glitter at all.",1
Hydrating and smells wonderful but did break me out. I love that it has Vit C in it but did develop mild surface level breakouts from it. Wouldn't detour me from using it but also isn't a selling point for me. I received this product complimentary for testing.,4
"hydrating duo I use prescription retin A ,  I constantly need hydration I mix the cream and serum together with it and apply at night. I wake up and still have soft supple skin.  I use to use lala reto cream from drunk elephant, but that is not hydrating enough for me. this is a great set and i am very happy with my purchase. who ever is in need of hydration you will love it.",1
"HYDRATING - GRIPPING-PRIMER! I haven't been a fan of Becca products in the past, I've tried there foundations, primers, powders, but this is awesome! First it smells AMAZING. its sweet but subtle. The  mist of fine and it gets kinds tacky afterwards. it's a great base of you have dry skin or need extra hydration. definitely grips foundation and it adds dew and glow FOR SURE! I look forward to this!! I think about the smell in my head even throughout the day lol. must try. (for reference, my other fave primer is Smashbox Primerizer. [Becca is def more glowy])",4
Hydrating night cream with the faintest rose fragrance. My skin has looked brighter and more luminous each morning that I have used this cream. I look forward to using it regularly in my night time skin care routine. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I would definitely purchase this product.,1
I absolutely adore all Caudalie products but this one made me break ou so badly! I don't know what ingredient my skin reacted to but I don't recommend this product if you have a skin with tendency to acne... even tho it is supposed to help with that..,0
"I absolutely ADORED this product this first time I used it! It provided the moisture my extremely dry skin needed without feeling sticky or slimy after application. My only concern is that when they changed the packaging a while back, they seemed to have added fragrance to is which I think was incredibly unnecessary (hence 4 instead of 5 stars), but it still felt good on my skin so I continued using it. The only way I'll stop using this product is if I find one just like it that works just as good without the added fragrance. It was perfect without it.",4
"I absolutely adore this eye gel liner! The only slight problem I am having is that it is not thin enough to give me cat eyes - you know, the little lines to accent the outside of your eyelid. It has a built-in sharpener but still the end is too thick. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong.",2
"I absolutely adore this lip tint. It's smooth, doesn't have a pungent smell, the color builds beautifully, and applies very well. It protects the lips well but doesn't have very strong staying power. This isn't a problem since that's not the point of the product. Color true to picture. Will definitely buy more! Highly recommend.",4
"I absolutely adore this mist! It is cooking to my sensitive skin and very refreshing. I also love the bottle design. My only complaint is that it can sometimes make your makeup act wonky, and that's only if you apply a heavy amount of the mist. I did receive this product for free.",0
"I absolutely adore this palette! These are pigments, so the color payoff is intense! Keep that in mind, as a little on the brush goes a long way. I love how multi-purpose the palette is, too...you can use it as eyeshadow, highlighter, blush, eyeliner, etc. The palette is the perfect size to just toss in your makeup bag or purse, and it’s heavy and feels luxurious. The shimmers are great because you can use them as is for a light shimmer topper, or if you spray with a setting spray, it intensifies and is so stunning. The mattes blend out really well with a good blending brush. I just love it! Norvina and ABH nailed it again! Even though I received this for free, these thoughts and opinions are mine! My integrity isn’t for sale :) I highly recommend this palette!",0
"I absolutely hated it!  I am full time student and my money is very important to me. I live in NYC and the air here has made my skin very dry.  This was suggested to me from a worker because of the pollution in the air.  After using it for a week, 2 times a day my skin still didn’t feel mositerized.  I took it back and was told Sephora changed the return rules.  That products can’t look too used. So I couldn’t get my money back or an exchange.  I am a Rouge member, so it’s obvious I spend a lot of money at Sephora.  I have never been so dissappointed.  The price is very high for only 1 ounce of product so of course it will looked used after a week’s worth of use.  Main point,  it doesn’t moisturize. Another worker suggested I use the companies pricey serum with it.  Got a sample and that didn’t make any difference either.  I just want my money back",3
"I absolutely live this mini gloss set. Colors are a light hue. So no overbearing colors. Not super sticky, and last a long time. Its been a while since I had a glossy gloss so it's a change for me. It helps that they are small, very easy to carry anywhere even your pants pocket. Smells good too. I would definitely buy it again.",1
"I absolutely love Cold Plasma Plus ...I used the original one with great results but they have improved the scent. It never really bothered me that much but did have that fishy smell. I use this after Deep Crease Serum, then Growth Factor Firming",4
"I absolutely loved this formula! It is wonderfully pigmented, it has a beautiful finish, and it stays all day! I love how it doesn't dry or crack your lips. It has the moisturizing consistency of a balm and its flattering on any skin tone!",4
"I absolutely loved this tonner when I first bought it. I recently repurchased it and as I was switching out my old bottle for the new one I noticed that the list of ingredients has easily doubled. It feels similar, but if you're looking for clean products, I would keep looking. The print is small, but the bottom section of writing is the ingredients on both bottles.",1
I absolutely love how easy it is to use this product. I have already placed my second order. To maintain a touch of color year around all you have to do is add a couple of drops to your lotion. How is is that?,2
I absolutely love it. its a bit pricey but I've had great results. I'm not a fan of the packaging but that is fairly standard for Pat McGrath(other than the mothership palettes with have the luxury look and feel to match the price point). I purchased the 3 piece set and it has become my go to.,4
"I absolutely love, love, love this eyeliner. The ultra thin brush applicator makes it effortless for a subtle inner corner highlight, or layer it for a bolder look. It's also gorgeous as a liner with a matte shadow to add something extra. Once it set, it stayed put all day. Pyro is fairy dust sparkle perfection. I'm getting at least two more colors!",4
"I absolutely love MJ eyeshadows, but haven't tried the items in this set.  I LOVE all three!  The mascara made my short, thin lashes look thick, black and long with minimal effort.  The eyeliner was effortless to glide on and it stayed very well throughout the day into the evening.  The lip gloss was amazing!  It applied buttery smooth and not tacky or sticky like most glosses.  It glides on and has excellent staying power.  I plan on buying a few more for Christmas gifts!",2
"I absolutely love the caramel version of Fresh's Hydrating Lip Balm so I tried the Lemon hoping that would be a nice addition for spring/summer. One word: ick! the scent is chemical than it is natural citrus. From what I could tell, the formula seems to be the same but the scent is disgusting.",1
I absolutely love the colors on this color palate! These are perfect fall colors too and they're light but still a pigmented color but easy to build if you're looking for something more dramatic. It's also just sheer enough to give you subtle color as well. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1
"I absolutely love the colour, it's highly complimentary. However, I have issues applying a clean line - maybe I just need the practice? But it transfers so much and it bleeds onto the skin below my lips. I tried setting it but no luck. Maybe I need to look more into it.",4
"I absolutely LOVE the Grandiose Extreme Wide-Angle Fan Effect Mascara!! It is, hands down, the best mascara I’ve ever used!!!  I was in a hurry and accidentally purchased this newer Grandiose Extreme Wide Angle Extreme Volume Mascara. When I applied it, I knew something was waaaaay off!!!  The product itself was very thick and caused my lashes to clump together horribly!! I’ve used better drug store mascaras!!  Will be returned no this for the original version ASAP!!!!",3
"I absolutely love the results of this product! THE ONLY DRAWBACK....You MUST CONTINUE to take them or your hair will return to its former state. That's the ONLY thing with these types of products. It can be very costly for some. I experienced fuller hair, it's thinned a bit with age but it's not bad. I definitely had better hair when I used my first bottle. I will continue to use them as they are great, but as I said, don't stop using them as you will get fallout. Hope this helps! Peace Out! I WISH they'd make a formula that you could take just for say 6 months and then go in to a ""maintenance"" regime. That hasn't been developed yet!! Get on this Moon Juice!!✌",3
"I absolutely love these brushes! I was able to snag these bad boys before they had sold out and I'm in love with them! No complaint whatsoever. I kid you not, I prefer these brushes over my Morphe brushes. You won't regret it!",4
"I absolutely love these highlighters.  I already owned moonstone and prismatic amethyst, and got the mini macaron collection for the holidays which included the amethyst, vanilla quartz, rose quartz and opal.  Love em all but rose quartz really stands out for me—such a flattering rosy shade that is not too pink.  All are lovely though.  I am thinking opal will be great with a bronzer for the summer.  The only shade I’ve tried that I did not like was, oddly, champagne pop.  It looked like I’d rubbed gold eye shadow on my face.  I’m sure it’s great for others though.  These do break easily since they have such a fine, soft texture, so be careful.  If you drop them they are done for.",2
I absolutely love the way it feels and makes my skin look... but literally after the days over I have a pimple coming out. I don't have acne and I break out once a year. I read the other reviews and I'm not the only one. I guess it's just one of those things that we aren't compatible. It's only for a while. haha.,0
"I absolutely love this blush. I bought the mini as blush isn't something I wear every single day. I'm so happy I tried this. I find the finish to be natural, not dry-matte but not really glowy, I love it because it doesnt show off texture but doesnt make you look dry.",3
"I absolutely love this blush! I recieved it as a free sample, and originally I was worried that this color was going to be too dark on my skintone. But it's really sheer and beautiful! Excited to try the coral one as well.",3
"I absolutely love this brow gel, I've tried other gels before birth clear and coloured but I've never found anything that can beat this quality and price. It's one if the cheaper clear brow gels out there and it definitely dies the job at holding all the brow hairs in place and lasting throughout the day.",0
"I absolutely LOVE this collection of awesome colors.  I have to tone them down a little due to my age (52 years old) and my profession (RN), but they are easy to work with, large amount so more bang for my buck and the included instructions are EXTREMELY helpful...even to the more ""seasoned make-up Peeps"" like myself-lol! If you like sparkles without clumps, this is your kind of shadow set. And the colors work well with my brown eyes-brings out the hazel in them! Highly recommend for everyone-young or older. You will not be disappointed!",3
"I absolutely love this concealer. Normally, I am underwhelmed by concealers, but this one wowed me. I use it under my eyes and on my nose. A very small amount goes a long way, just let it warm to your skin first and you will see. This is not a concealer you are going to liberally apply under your eyes like normal. Just a pin head or so size amount will warm and cover under each eye nicely. This product lasts much longer on my nose (where most concealers seperate), especially when followed with a waterproof powder. I highly recommend this product.",1
"I absolutely love this cream! The scent is a little medicinal, but not too offputting. The ceramides help to repair damaged skin, so it's a must for me! It hydrates without being too heavy on the skin!",2
I ABSOLUTELY  love this eyeliner. I got this in the sample size because I wanted to make sure it wasnt going to bleed in my eyeshadow like my favorite NYX eyeliner was sadly. and I got 4 different liquid eyeliners including this one and this one won out.  But I can honestly say my wings have been sharper than every and better shaped with this product. will definitely be buying the full size next pay period.,1
"I absolutely love this formula! I've had this lipstick on for 7 hours now, I had lunch, drank coffee, ate snacks, and I still don't even need a second coat or touch up! Amazing pigment, it's so lightweight and non-drying for a matte lipstick. The color is also perfect for the fall! Zero complaints. I love this product!",0
"I absolutely love this foundation. I have the other Double Wear liquid as well, but it tends to be too heavy and cakey for my preference, and I don't need heavy coverage. This stuff is perfect, and has the same perfect color match for me as the original.  it goes on light and silky, and it doesn't feel heavy at all. I think the finish is more natural that strictly matte, though.",2
"I absolutely love this. I'm not sure it blurs all my lines, but it leaves a beautiful glow. I used it once, and now I can't stop  using it. I love the packaging, which was never a factor for me, but I take this everywhere. Its like taking a filter around with me.",4
"I absolutely love this! It helps to gently exfoliate and I get softer and softer skin each day. I've noticed a softening in some of the pigmentation so I feel like that might get lighter with longer use. I also could use this seamlessly under makeup! I absolutely love everything about this product. Please note I received this product for review, but my review is completely honest.",1
I absolutely love this.It pretty much gives you very light coverage. It is very easy to blend and feels like you are wearing nothing on your face. I also like the ingredients on this because it will protect me from the sun effectively. I highly recommend this.,0
"I absolutely love this lipstick!!! The red is a gorgeous warm red, my “prescribed” red is supposed to be cool toned (this is not) and I absolutely love it. Bright and festive, perfect for when you want a bold and stunning red lip. The wear was pretty good, the formula is not the most hydrating, but it doesn’t really affect how much I love this color. I would buy for Christmas/Holidays or for Valentines! Beautiful.",1
"I absolutely love this mascara, I have barely there eyelashes both on top and bottom, it made them look like I had false eyelashes on. In addition, this mascara stays in place, it didn't dry out, flake, or cake up.  I have the travel-size version that I used my rewards points on, I will be buying larger one when this one runs out.\n\nI do recommend this product!",3
I absolutely love this pallet. Natasha Denona pallets in general are worth the splurge. The pigmentation of the shadows is incredible and they are also very buttery. They blend like a dream on the eye. This pallet has been a go to for the last few months for me. Definitely recommend!,1
"I absolutely love this pallet. Out of all the eyeshadow palettes I own this is one of my favorites. ALL the colors go on with ease and are beautiful. Honestly I got it because of the case, but glad I did for the colors.Ciate London has never let me down.",3
"I absolutely love this powder. I tend to wear a more natural sheer foundation and enjoy a more radiant dewy look. I am personally not a fan of setting powders and found that this blur powder works wonderful with taking the tackiness away from my foundation but still keeping the radiance. Definitely my favorite ""setting powder"".",0
"I absolutely love this product. I have been using it once or twice a week for two months, and it makes my skin soft and radiant after! I noticed a reduction in my pores as well, as I have bigger pores on my nose and cheeks. Already purchased another bottle!",4
"I absolutely love this product... it smells wonderful and the texture is perfect to scrub away the rough patches. Just a hint: get their coconut bath soak and fill up the tub. Then get in the tub and use this scrub... the results  not only are skin softening, but the smell combination is magical.",3
I absolutely love this serum! My skin is literally reset over night. It has light texture and absorbs quickly and leaves skin hydrated and wake up so plump and fresh in the morning. Also love the ingredients and absolute joy to use it and not to mention package is stunning!!,2
"I absolutely love this set! I have a pretty oily t-zone and dry cheeks, this has been the solution to both those problems. The sizes are huge. Love the box and carrier it came in. Can't recommend it enough.",4
I absolutely love this stuff and use it morning and night as the first step of my skincare routine. My work pals have even called out how glowing my skin looks. I tried the Caudalie Premier Cru Serum which wasn’t 1/10 as good to my skin as the Vine [Activ].,2
"I absolutely love Volition products! This one has an innovative technology I hadn't thought of! we protect our skin against the sun's rays but not the daily blue light we are constantly exposed to. I am definitely seeing a smoothing, hydrating change in my skin after just one week. It appears more glowy and brighter as well. I will definitely continue to use and I'm sure it will become another one of my favorite Volition products! Something I didn't know I needed, but so glad I have!",1
"I accidentally bought the light/medium in the summer when I actually wanted the darker one but I'm surprised that I liked this one so much! I have medium olive toned skin and 4-6 drops definitely have a nice, subtle glow. It's more expensive than Isle of Paradise but I feel like I like it better.",2
"I actually got this pallet from boxycharm, but I'm really not a fan. I couldn't imagine getting this full priced. It's not worth the price! The colors are beautiful, but you have to really dig in to the pan to get any color. I had to use my finger to really pack the powder on, because the color looked so faded. Pigment is bogus. Wouldn't recommend buying.",0
"I actually had all of these neon obsessions palettes but only kept the green one because I think the shades are stunning. But they are flaky and a bit messy. They are also not very pigmented. I don't know why this is considered a neon palette considering there are only 3 ish neon shades. The only purpose where I feel people will get a good amount of use out of these babies is if they use them as topper shades, but you may have minor glitter fallout.",0
"I actually hated this! There was not one redeeming quality in this product. First off, the product has those mini beads/capsules in it that need to be broken open. This is virtually impossible around the eye area without pulling/tugging quite hard (which we all know is a big no no). Second, this is not moisturizing at all. The gel/water serum is so light its like you applied water under your eyes and dries to nothing. Worst of all this completely ruined my makeup. It caused my concealer to ball up and flake off when blending it out. AVOID!",1
I actually have combo skin but this winter is hitting my skin harder than ever drying out even my most oily places. I have dry spots that continue to crack and bleed and nothing really seemed to be working until I got this. my face immediately looks and feels better. no more cracking! I think I'll try their repair salve next.,1
"I actually liked the way this felt on my skin, but thought I had bought a bottle that had gone bad or something, until I saw the rest of the comments about the smell. Smells similar to when oil goes rancid.",1
"I actually loved all the colors. The formula is great and hydrating. They are slim and fit perfectly in small bags, taking up little space compared to a lot of other lip products. I definitely recommend these.",4
"I actually love this product ... but who came up with the bottle?  How frustrating it is to get anything out!! The product is thick and perfect for leveling pores, but you have to work to get any out.  I took the spout out and just used a cutip. When I couldn't get anymore out that way, I actually cut the bottle open and was able to get at least two weeks of product transferred to another container. This is too much work and money to recommend. I wish it were different.",2
"I actually paid for this primer, I use their luminous silk foundation also. It feels nice on the skin, not too thick or oily, it is kind of moisturizing, did not leave a shiny finish either. Not silicone feeling like their original primer was. One star off for the amount you get for the price. Don't know if I will repurchase.",3
"I actually purchased this set directly from Farmacy before I saw it was being sold here. I love their products, especially honeymoon glow and green clean. This set is a great price for the honeymoon glow alone. The cleanser is also nice, but I haven't tried the oil yet. I would recommend purchasing through Sephora for customer care/ease of delivery.",3
I actually really enjoy this foundation. I have normal to dry skin and I find this foundation hydrating and long-lasting. Typically a foundation is either hydrating but doesn't last long or matte and long-lasting. This foundation has a nice satin natural finish. and Fenty shade selection is perfection. I'm able to find a shade that matches me perfectly. Overall I was very impressed with this foundation and I definitely recommend.,1
I actually really liked this cream. After a week or so of using it I noticed the skin under my eyes seemed more bouncy and less tired. I will definitely buy again in the future. I received this item as a complimentary sample.,1
"I actually think this set is a pretty good value, I don't get the complaints! I've been wanting to try out the caviar sticks for a while, but was hesitant to commit to the full size...this set is perfect, you get two flattering shades and a little goes a long way, so I'm sure they'll last a while. They're pretty, easily blendable, and you can do an eye look in basically 30 seconds. They're very similar to the Bobbi Brown eyeshadow sticks, although I think I prefer the BB ones - they're a bit more pigmented and last longer.  I'm still keeping them though! :)",1
"I actually use this for my setting powder and I love it. I didn't realize it was meant for foundation until reading the reviews, but now am excited to try that we well! I've owned mine now for probably over a year and has held up great!",2
"I admittedly am a big skeptic towards anything being the cure all. I've had weak, fragile nails most of life. Like, breaks at the idea of doing dishes, bends all the way down the middle of the nail bed, rips off when I pick something up nails. I've been using this product for 2 weeks now, as a standalone product. 2 coats every every 2 days. My nails haven't broken since the 3rd day. As I am typing this, I can't bend my nails, they won't give easily to my fingers pressure. they are whiter, stronger, and GROWING. I am so excited to finally have nails extend past my fingertips. I highly recommend giving this product a try, it is worth every penny I spent.",1
I adore every color in this set. They arent super pigmented which I actually prefer but they are pigmented enough to where you can notice the color on your lips. The gloss is buttery smooth when you put it on and it smells amazing. The only reason I took off 1 star is because once the gloss has been on for a bit of time you can feel the glitter on your lips and it starts to feel scratchy like my lips are dry. If they finely milled the glitter a bit more I think it would resolve that minor issue. It's not a deal breaker for me though since that is just a minor annoyance. I really hope she makes these full sized!,1
I adore Gimme Brow and have like the Goof Proof and Precisely My Brow when I've used them in the past. I figured this was a great deal to receive all three! Only the pencils were completely dried out. The precisely was unusable and I had to rub the Good Proof a bunch to get to somewhat usable product. Overall not super impressed with this set unfortunately.,1
"I adore MJ lip glosses... this is the perfect chocolate nude for dark and deep women of color. Also if you love pigment but not dry crusty lips from liquid lips, this this perfect. Purchased the last one in my store. Hopefully they will get more soon!!",4
"I adore the layout and colours of this palette and the smell is delicious! Iowever, whenever I try using it I find I get little breakouts on my browbone and outer edges of my eyelids. I imagine the fragrance is to blame but my other Too Faced palettes (peach matte and regular peach) have never given me a reaction. I've tried using it several spaced out times, and the bumps always happen. It's a beautiful and well thought out palette with lots of pigment, it just doesn't get along with me.",1
I ADORE this foundation. I am using the shade 130 and it is a really good match for my skin tone. As a fair skinned lady I appreciate that the shades offered are not too orange or yellow. The foundations also blends out really nice and meshes with my skin. Coverage is medium and the finish is dewy to satin and looks great after a day at work still.,1
"I adore this kit. The smell of watermelons in the m moisturizer and night mask is superb. The mask is gentle but I notice a definite glow after using it. The moisturizer is non-greasy, makes my skin feel hydrated, and a little bit goes a long way. The blueberry cleanser doesn't have a strong of a smell as the mask and moisturizer but is very gentle on my skin while making my skin feel refreshed and clean without being dry.",4
"I adore this mascara because it is amazing! Not only is it waterproof but once dry, it is 'oil proof' as well which prwvents 'racoon eyes' if you had them then you know what I mean. It is longwearing and volumizes your lashes can build  up to 'taranrula eyes'.  Scentless and amazing!",2
I adore this. The claims were fairly lofty but it lives up to the hype. I have used this before my moisturizer morning and night for 2 weeks. I noticed a firming of the skin and a smoothing over time and the plumping happens right away. I can feel it warming on my face but it doesn't burn or sting even with my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way and it pairs wonderfully with both my other Perricone products as well as other brands. Totally worth trying.,2
"I adore this. The effect is spectacularly opposite to dark circles. had I known about this decades ago, I would have avoided an endless dance of beige fair to yellow concealers all together. All that ended right here.",4
I agree with all the contact wearers. it somehow creates a film on my lenses. I thought it was maybe because my contacts were old. then maybe because I was tired or because I was at the beach. nope. when I didnt wear this my eyes were fine. also it smells. like not just out of the tube but I can smell it all day. it smells like... I dont know. neosporin or band aids or hospitals. I'm glad I got it as a free promo. I definitely wouldnt spend money on this. it doesnt flake like BTS but I'll stick with that. I have long eyelashes naturally. i get them tinted and usually just have to curl them but sometimes i wear mascara when i want a bolder look. it wont be this one though. the smell is intolerable and the benefit doesnt outweigh the negative parts.,4
"I agree with the other reviews that this new formula is terrible. As a long time user of the old formula, this is really disappointing. Not only does it make my face look dry, but I also blindly ordered my old shade ""natural"", and it is completely different. The old natural is 2W3 and the new natural is 2W1, and is more of an orangey tone than the old version as you can see in the pics. It looks like LM no longer makes a 2W3 :(",0
I agree with the reviewer who said she uses this as a day cream. I have very dry sensitive skin and this product does help heal up the flakiness. I've used it night and day. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it's not especially effective as an overnight mask. I'd need something more effective for that purpose.,3
"I almost didn’t buy this, because I didn’t know exactly how big it was. I like to know measurements if I’m buying something like this online. Glad I bought it anyway!! It’s pretty spacious, and it’s a durable container! Looks nice. Worth the money!!",0
"I almost didn't want to get this due to the price and size. I tried it and at first was a bit disappointed because it felt like it brought out my bumps. But the next morning OH MY. My skin looked amazing and totally hydrated. I will say I have it 4 stars because my jar wasn't full which is sad given the cost. Even with a thin layer 1 ounce for this price, yikes.",2
I already had the board meeting lipstick in my cart but then this set came out and I had to have it. the lip liner is super creamy and glides on easily. The shade of lip liner is darker than the lipstick and is so flattering. the formula of the actual lipstick is super comfortable. feels kind of plushy and never dry. I had it on for hours and kept forgetting I had lipstick on.,1
"I already have and love the truth serum, and ordered this just for fun. Because honestly, how could I not?? The 0.5oz truth serum on its own is $22, but this set (which includes 0.5oz truth serum) is $15 AND I get a travel size of the oil control toner! This stuff is honestly the best, my skin looks so radiant and supple.",4
"I already have Diamond Bomb so I wasn't considering purchasing this at all. BUT I walked into a Sephora and there it was in all its glory. I swiped it with my finger...same amazing almost gel like structure that won't shatter into a million bits in your purse. Okay, I thought...this is good.Then I swiped it on my arm...looked at the employee hovering at the entrance table...looked back at my arm...gasped...looked at the employee again and yelled, ""oh my god! This is freaking amazing"" Yes people. RiRi has knocked it out of the park with this one. Get your hands on it while you can. It is simply stunning. I mean I am almost ashamed of how much makeup I own but this has freaking blown my mind. I even looked at it when I woke up this morning and sighed. Its that pretty people. Get this. And a heartfelt thank you to Rihanna for going there and pushing the envelope on makeup. I really feel like you have changed this industry. Finally! A true visionary.",3
"I always keep these around, I don't use them to remove makeup, I use them on some morning to remove any night creams or serums I had applied. I also don't use wipes on my eyes at all. So for my purposes, these are refreshing and handy to have around. Have bought several times. I don't care if they are a little smaller TBH.",3
"I always purchase a mini if I can, to test the product first before paying full price. Lights, Camera, Lashes is an amazing product. I have been in mascara purgatory for awhile, tried several brands, nothing gave me the WOW factor until this mini showed up. Easy to apply, no clumping, easy to remove and I definitely get WOW lashes after several coats. Very happy with this purchase and I will gladly buy a full size, once the mini is finished.  Dries out a bit after full day wear but no flaking or racoon eyes.",3
"I am 19 years old and I suffer from severe cystic acne. I have combo/oily skin. I have literally tried EVERYTHING when it comes to acne treatments including salicylic acid filled treatments, benzoyl peroxide, Differin gel, clindacinamide, AHAs, BHA toners and other retinols. I have even purchased the Drunk Elephant A-passioni retinol due to it's 1.0% concentrate of retinol. As that retinol worked, it left my skin feeling dry and my skin would constantly peel like a snake. So, of course, when I saw this product targeted at 1.0%, I thought my skin would freak out again. But, no! This product had a small purge period for my skin, but after two weeks.. my skin is the clearest it has ever been! My cystic acne bumps are very minimal and I am just left with hyperpigmentation. This retinol is a slow release, so I have NO REACTION OR IRRITATION whatsoever. This product is a holy grail for me and I'm so excited I have found something that really works for my skin! (especially at this price!!!) Even though this product is targeted towards anti-aging, definitely give it a try for acneic skin! This will work wonders for you!",0
"I am 39 y/o with dry skin, lots of acne, and texture issues. I wore a decent layer of this primer once on Christmas day (which was two days ago) with my IT Celebration powder (not currently available at Sephora) over and my Vanicream Lite moisturizer under. I let each layer dry at least 10 minutes. The primer seemed to make my makeup go on more evenly, but didn't hide all of my flaws; it just smoothed them out a tad. My makeup did start to break down around the same amount of time it would have without the primer. However, it didn't completely break down 8 hours later like it would have had I not been wearing the primer. Two days later, I have no new breakouts, either, which I would have had I worn the foundation alone. Especially since I ate little but carbs and sugar the past couple of days. So...there it is. I will probably keep using it and try it with another foundation, because I like that it is ok with my dry skin and doesn't cause acne.",1
"I am 41 and I have very dry skin. Most powders make my under eye area look crepe and extremely dry looking/feeling. I heard the hype about this powder and was on the hunt for a good one. Boy am I glad I went for this one! The first day I used it I was amazed at how nice my entire face looked and felt. I am always getting compliments on my makeup and complexion now, too. It's definitely sitting on the top of my vanity along with my other Holy grails.",4
"I am 53 years old with some fine lines, texture,  and dark spots.  I received this product in a VoxBox from Influenster free, for testing purposes.  This does live up to its claims in many ways.   \n\nWhat I really like about this product is that it really does reduce the appearance of crepey skin, which wasn't really made as a direct claim, but it was the first thing I noticed.  It does claim to help with ""firming"", though, and I agree that it does.  I used it at night as the directions indicated,  but also tried it during the day to see how it performed that way, also.  I find most moisturizers do not work well under makeup for me,  as they tend to exacerbate texture as the day goes on.  This product didn't do that, and my makeup still looked great 8 hours on, so I feel like it can be used in the daytime, though it doesn't contain a sunscreen. \n\nAs for the brightening effect,  I am not immediately seeing this, but it might take longer to see these results, as the vitamin C has an opportunity to penetrate the epidermal layers and work it's magic.  I will post an update on this.  I regularly exfoliate,  so my complexion is pretty bright to begin with.\n\nThe packaging,  though convenient,  concerns me because of potential product waste.  Although I don't need more than a pea sized amount of product for my entire face and neck, the pump design may prevent the last vestiges of product from being dispensed.  Time will tell. \n\nOverall,  this is one of the best products I have tried for my aging skin.  The improvement in texture, moisturizing, and smoothing of crepey skin is definitely noticeable from the first use. The brightening effect needs more time to be seen.  I'm going to be purchasing this, and based on this product,  I'm interested in trying other products from this line.",3
"I am 55 with combo skin (normal to oily) and started a little late in life with a good skin care routine. I should've started a long time ago! However, I've only been using this product for about a month and I can already tell a difference in my skin tone or texture. It's a great product for a great price. I will repurchase this product.",3
"I am a big fan of serums and love to try new products in the market. I received this complimentary from Influenster. I used it after toning and moisturizer as a base for makeup. Loved the scent and the overall texture it gave my skin. Although I would admit that it looked heavy sometimes. I am not sure if it was the combination of my moisturizer or toner. Not sure if if I am going to buy this again, but definitely emptying the bottle out!",1
"I am a blush girl, I was so excited to get my first Charlotte Tilbury product and of course I had to pick the blush. I love the color I love the formula it's amazing. However, after the second time I used it the clasp on the plastic compact broke and now it will not close all the way. especially for the luxury price tag. I don't know if I would buy it from her line again honestly",2
"I am a brunette and have been hunting for brow products for years. Now this product if used properly is the answer. You dip the tiny brush into the gel, then tap into the cover so that you won’t have too much. Start at the middle or end of the brow and work toward the front to get the most balanced look. This takes a little practice, but it can give your face balance.",3
"I am absolutely in love with this moisturizer! It's so hard for me to find any that work well with my oily, aging, acne-prone skin, as well as my huge pores. But this feels absolutely amazing, not sticky or greasy, sinks right into a beautiful satin finish and leaves my skin feeling smooth and plush. it works amazingly well under both makeup and sunscreen. And of course, the price point is unbeatable! I will definitely continue purchasing!",2
"I am a die hard ""better than sex"" mascara user so when I received this mascara in my influenster voxbox, I wasn't sure. I decided to use it on a night out I knew I would sweat and laugh. My lashes looked to good it was unbelievable. they were lifted and full and It wasn't itchy, I laughed so hard tears were in my eyes and my mascara was completely un bothered. I think i may have been converted. I will definitely purchase after the complimentary one is done.",2
I am a fan of ABH and I'm happy with this bronzer. I have an olive complexion and get pretty tan in the summer! This is very pigmented and gives a natural bronze goddess glow but a little goes a long way - definitely buildable should you want to deepen the tone. I have used this a lot in the summer ( there is a bit of a red undertone so it looks very sun kissed) but I'm not sure that I will be using this as much in the winter months.,4
"I am a huge fan of Algenist products. I recently added this along with their firming serum and retinol to my routine. I am not sure which product is working best for me, but I give this and the firming serum (come on Sephora! Start selling it online!) a great deal of credit. I take good care of my 55 year old skin, but was somewhat late to the party in doing so, so there is some damage, but I can definitely see an improvement in fine lines AND wrinkles since I started using these. It is pricey, but far from the most expensive, plus when I consider all the different products I have used in the past, narrowing it down to a few Algenist products will probably be more cost effective in the end. I definitely recommend this product as well as the others I have mentioned.",4
"I am a huge fan of Bite lipsticks in all forms for both the formula which is satiny smooth even in the matte formulations - but also because hands-down there's no brand with more shades that are that magic word, 'wearable'.\n\nChai and Rhubarb are my two staples all year, and I love the incongruously-named Licorice when I want a bit more drama.\n\nWith this set, I've got 4 new shades in rotation:\nGood Jujube (pink nude) \nRuby BonBon (rosy pink)\nCocoa Bite (warm nude)\nCherry Truffle (spiced red)\n\nI am ethnically Welsh-Irish-German - fair-skinned - and have rosacea. It can be challenging to find shades that look flattering without foundation. While I'm technically a neutral to yellow undertone, many nude shades simply disappear on my lips, and leave me looking sickly. It's so frustrating!\n\nNot so with Good Jujube and Cocoa Bite - both manage to warm up my face and give me a healthy natural look. I'm guessing that on darker skintones, these two shades would show more of their pink tones - they definitely are neutral, but they're well-pigmented and not sheer at all.\n\nThe Ruby BonBon is one of the most flattering dusty pink's I've tried in years - it's almost a dup for an old favorite, Maybelline Dusky Mauve - but better staying power.\n\nFinally, Cherry Truffle looks darker in photos online than i find it to be in person. I thought it was going to be a deep dramatic red - but surprise! It's a muted red that is actually super flattering on my skin, and would easily work for daytime/the office as well as nighttime/weekends. Usually reds end up looking either goth or oxidizing towards a purple hue on my lips, but not this one. Despite the name hinting at winter, this red works all year.\n\nAll in all, just a great find and four new colors that will be joining my regulars and the price is very fair for true miniatures that are perfect for even your smallest clutch.",2
I am allergic to many sheet masks made in Korea but this one is definitely safe. I dont understand why the ratings are so low but in my opinion this mask is very hydrating and the serum stays on the mask. It doesnt leak on your face to make a mess. I took one star off because of the price but for sensitive skins we dont have many options anyways.,1
"I am always hesitant to try anything with crazy claims because I never see the results everyone else does, but this time was definitely different! I decided to try this after I fell in love with the Algenist collagen hand cream and let me just say I'm so happy I did!!! From the moment I put it on my skin felt instantly smoother which didn't go away even after I washed my face. I am 39 and looking for anything to give me smooth soft supple skin again, which this definitely did!! I had some lingering redness from a breakout and some exfoliating and this product eliminated that almost instantly!! wow cannot reccomend it enough! try it you won't be sorry!!",2
"I am always in the market for a great exfoliator that isn't harsh on my skin, and this product is absolutely amazing. I used last night on my skin and this morning I woke up with the softest skin. My pores appeared smaller, and my makeup went on better! The smell isn't overwhelming as ACV can be, I actually loved the smell. This product is a total winner in my book!",1
"I am always leery of creme formulas for eyes as they tend to get gloppy on me and eyeshadow primer usually doesn't stay on.  However, after reading rave reviews, I gave this a try and I am so glad I did!  While it is indeed an opaque cream formula, it goes on very smoothly almost like a gel.  I was also worried that it may have too much pigment in it because I am very hard to match for concealer.  No, this goes on very sheer and should be good for any skin tone.  Absorbs quickly.  Finally, I was worried it might be irritating; I have had to toss other high-rated products because they made my eyes burn.  Not this one!  Expensive but a little bit goes a very long way.  I also like that it's good for the whole eye area, not just under the eyes.  Plays well with eyeshadow primers and liners.  My new go-to.",2
"I am always on the hunt for the perfect lip balm so when I saw this, I knew I had to pick it up. I really enjoy how moisturized my lips feel after 1 use. The packaging is too adorable to pass up!!! please make available in store.",1
"I am always on the look out for the best chapstick for each season when the weather changes (I live in MI). This is the best chapstick year round. It's not too heavy but not too light either. It moisturizes like a dream. The scent isn't too in your face, it's just a nice light minty scent. It has a little bit of a cooling effect. I also love the packaging. I work with animals and am on my feet all day and it is great to throw in your pocket and go and is not bulky at all! A must try.",0
"I am a mascara junkie. I've tried most of the top brands Sephora carries. I like mascara to keep my lashes curled, make them thicker and longer, but not to the point where it looks like a fake lash. This mascara did all this. The non bulky brush makes it easy to apply without ruining the liner on your lashline. And it lasts all day without flaking or leaving a ring on my upper eyelids. It literally looks like I just put it on in the morning when I take it off at night.  Great buy!",3
I am a momma and I needed something quick to look decent. It wore very nice but the end of the day i wash my face i had 5 major zits no my chin. Its hard to find a tinted moisturizer that doesn't break me out. Its something in their spf. if i use a sunscreen like la roche posay or elta md then a foundation. I have no breakouts. I was trying to save me time. Tati  YouTube sensation mention the same thing with her skin. Im not alone. As soon as these makeup industries use better spf I cannot buy another tinted moisturizer. Same with bb and cc creams. I gave it 2 stars because it wore nicely.,2
"I am a natural blond and finding a good color for my brows can be difficult...my brows are really blond and hard to see plus a bit on the sparse side.  I don't like a drawn-on brow but this fairly decent.  The color is nice (#3),\nMy cons:  \nit gets flaky when I brush it out \nRubs off easily\nGoes too fast...doesn't last\nPricey",3
"I am a skeptic when it comes to stuff like this. But I have got to tell you, I love this product I have been using this since August, faithfully. I even put it on under my lower lashes. I use mine twice a day. I can see the difference for sure. I love it. The length of my lashes compared to when I used lattise much longer. The price you can't beat it.",4
"I am a Tatcha lover and this is a disappointment. I do love the formula and the fine mist, BUT it constantly gets clogged and sprays sideways. I also think there should be more product for the price. I went through it quicker than any other setting spray. Tatcha, you can do better.",0
"I am blessed with great, non-picky skin. Well, apparently until I tried this line. :((( After 2 day use my forehead broke out in small bumpy rash. It’s been over a week now and the home remedies are not helping, so I am now spending hundreds of dollars on a cosmetologist to clear it up.",3
"I am by no means a pro at makeup and somehow the formula on these eyeshadows make the application so effortless. This is the first palette that has 100% wearable tones for my skin too!  I love the big mirror on this, makes life way easier while travelling.",2
I am currently undergoing retinol treatment so SPF is mandatory for my skin (NC 45 for reference).  I've tried a few brands even the ones from the esthetician but all have left me looking like a zinc cast greaseball but NO LONGER!  I actually look forward to applying this over my moisturizer as opposed to it being a chore and it is now part of my daily routine.   At first I was skeptical bit even my dermatologist gives it her seal of approval and said my skin is improving without the dreaded sun damage.,4
"I am disappointed again. This eyeliner just won't stay put on my eyelids. It both transfers and disappears. To be fair, I am hard on eyeliner so I've only found a few brands that last. This is not one of them. While it lasts, I do love the color - a slightly warm gray with NO silver.",4
"I am doing the happy dance! I have tried at least 6 foundations this past year trying to get both a match and the coverage I like for my large pore, combo skin. At last I have found the perfect one! This foundation is beautiful. It is light coverage but it does cover my redness and gives a gorgeous glow. It also feels so lightweight on too and not dry or powdery. This one is a definite keeper!",3
"I am fairly new to makeup. I really wanted to love these because of the color scheme. I love red and oranges. I bought the ruby and coral palettes when they were on sale. I own some other palettes by Urban Decay and Tarte. I was very pleased at first because of how nicely they blended and how beautiful the colors applied on the eyes. unfortunately I have decided to return them. Reason number 1 being that the shelf life is only 12 months and I already have 3 bigger eyeshadow pallets by UD and tarte, and I hate to be wasteful. And 2 being these shadows seem to irritate my eyes. I wore the ruby palette 3 times and the coral palette 3 times and every time my eyes felt so sore and watery after just an hour or 2. I'll be going back to my Tarte palettes.",1
I am familiar with Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare and was interested in trying a resurfacing peel to relieve myself of the dead skin on my face. I have really oily skin so I figured this would help. At first I did notice some peeling but then my face became super drying. After reading the ingredients I noticed that alcohol denat was at the top of the list. This is very bad for my skin so I stopped using it.,1
"I am forever on the lookout for a good moisturizer.This cream is to me of a more light consistency once it's actually out of the jar and rubbed on the face. Comes in a glass jar, (better than plastic) has no greasy feel, no perfumed smell, just really fresh and natural, it gives that perfect dewy face vibe. I really like to use this cream as a base or carrier to add a serum or other stuff to because of the emulsification factor. The only draw back for me was that I didn't feel that it was super creamy or moisturizing so I ended up having to use more of it, thus the product didn't last me as long as I hoped it would. But overall I would give this cream a good rating because of how natural and multi-useful it was.",2
"I am glad that ""No Makeup"" finally has a color match for my lips: Red.  This looks like my lips with some shine.  It's exactly ""no makeup"", because it looks like clear lip gloss, but it does look pretty natural. It adds moisture, and much-needed sunscreen. I wear it when I know I'm going to be exposed to the sun, but it's not interesting enough to be an every day color for me.  It is SO difficult to find  lip products with Titanium Dioxide sunscreen that I am willing to pay the ridiculously inflated cost for this lipstick.  It is not particularly long-lasting, but it is moisturizing. It does not melt onto my face (like the Fresh SPF lipcolors do on me.)  If this did not have SPF I would not bother using it, because there are other red lip colors I prefer. I usually pay $14 for my favorite red lip gloss, and $18 for my favorite red lipstick, so you can see how important it is to me to keep lip SPF on hand.",3
I am happy to say that this actually works. I use it in the morning and at night (as instructed) and I can already see a noticeable difference in the dark circles and the bags under my eyes. A little bit goes a long way so don't let the size and the price detour you. This is well worth it!,1
I am honestly really cheap which is why I only bought the small pot but this mask is so great I'm willing to buy the bigger container. this mask is fairly lightweight and easy to use. a little goes a long way.\nI've tried a similar product that works really well but feels rough on the hands in application (which concerns me for my face) but this mask applies so nicely that I'm not worried. I do feel my face has brightened up nicely and feels clean and refreshing after rinse.,0
"I am huge matte lip color wears and I wear multiple brands from Victoria secret to NARS but this brand was new for me. I was returning an orange coil color. I tried on multiple different lip colors none of them seem to due. Everything was beginning to look so repetitive until I tried on this shade. As odd as it seems this shade looks more of purplish pink on my lips.  It's the perfect color for my brown tan olive skin tone. I do feel the menthol plumping effect which is very new. It has a comfort shine that is so different. I can wear this color with any occasion and setting (work, dinner, hanging out, typical day, birthday or whatever). I really in truly recommend everyone to at least try on ANY SHADE from any brand before purchasing it. Just because it appears pink on the youtuber or model on the photo doesn't mean it will look pink on the customer.",4
"I am impressed by this serum/primer. It soaks right into the skin and instantly makes my face feel more hydrated and glowy. I like that you can also use it as a primer! One thing that I'm not a fan of is the smell, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. Overall, I really enjoy this serum.",0
"I am impressed with these little dots! I have a spot on my forehead that I have had laser treatments on twice but still remained. I saw an actual difference from using these. So, although the spot is still there it is lighter. I can only imagine what it can do to a spot that isn’t as stubborn. I found them super easy to use and I didn’t have any problems with them sticking. I applied at night and it was still securely on my face in the morning.",3
"I am impressed with this product. I have mature, oily, and hyperpigmentation skin issues. After using this product I have seen a difference. My skin is becoming brighter and my pores are not so prominent. I was concerned that this would be too harsh for my face but it was not. It is on the pricer side but worth it. This is part of my skin care routine now.",2
I am in complete love with this set!  Each color is so beautiful as both a highlighting powder for face or body and an eyeshadow.  Just using different brushes takes them from barely-there glowy highlights to a full coverage eyeshadow.  Super happy with this purchase!,3
"I am in love!! Girls Trip is the perfect nude lip for my skin tone. just enough colour, goes on creamy and smooth. It last through coffee, a bagel and even a morning cigarette (don't judge me)\nit even looks nice under the flourescent lighting which is quite a feat. highly recommend!",1
I am in love!!!! It’s a full coverage foundation without the heaviness feeling of it....it sets to a satiny finish and you literally look airbrushed. It is amazing!!!!! It didn’t break me out or give me any reaction. I am recommending it to everyone who loves full coverage. I did have to blot after some hours but that’s normal with any foundation for me. It’s still lasted at least 12 hours with minimal touchup or blotting. I am MAC NC 20 and this matched perfect.  I love it!!,2
"I am in love with this brow pencil! Definitely my new Go-To. I have very sparce brows, due to a childhood accident, they do not grow right. I have to draw them, which took a long time to learn. I have tried almost everything. An influencer I follow uses this so I decided to try it. It goes on easy and stays on ALL day!",4
I am in love with this lip balm. it does not dry out quickly like other brands I have tried. it also has no overpowering taste or smell. the applicator is also adorable. This will be a permanent go to for me.,4
"I am in love with this palette. It has a lot of fun colors but the best part about it is how little you have to use. I didn't realize this when I first wore it and ended up with a giant mess all over my face. I figured out that less is more. I literally tap my brush into it once and that typically gets me what I need. If not,  I'll follow up with another tap to build it up. It's insane how little it takes.  I'm assuming all of the other Anastasia palettes are the same way,  so any of them would be an excellent investment.",2
"I am in my 30s, do not have sensitive skin, and have mostly normal and sometimes combination skin. I received a mini size as a bday Sephora gift. I layered the moisturizer over a retinol serum and the result was super moisturized, hydrated, bouncy skin. The next morning I would wake up to very smooth, more even toned, soft skin. That only last for about the 3 days. Afterwards I noticed tiny bumps on my forehead and cheeks. I checked out the ingredients and noticed exfoliating acids in the moisturizer which I think became too much being that I use a retinol every night. That is my guess anyway...unfortunately I will not purchase the full size as retinol is a staple product in my regimen that I don't see myself not using anytime soon. I believe in the product description, somewhere it should be mentioned that there are exfoliating acids in it. But overall, I believe this moisturizer is a good one, you just have to be careful as to what other products you are using with it at the moment.",2
"I am in my early 30s and have light neutral dry combo skin. I was recommended this foundation by an employee. I had seen lots of reviews of how much people loved it. I had such high hopes for this foundation... Well this sinks into fine lines and wrinkles you wouldn't even think you had, especially the smile lines. Yuck. It was not AT ALL long wearing (seriously only looks good for the first 2 hours MAX).Super yellow toned and transfers no matter how you set it. More Matte than you expect and doesn't look like skin or natural at all! Textured regardless of moisturizing and priming first. Also gave me white bumps after. Blah so disappointed because I really wanted to love this. Waste of money. I have applied with every technique but I just don't like this foundation and would NEVER recommend this!",4
"I am in my mid 40's and have tried and bought many high end primers. I expect alot from them and takes alot to keep me happy. Most hydrating primers that are ""glowy"" have broke me out and so I just kept buying Smashbox, which has done more to fill and smooth than others. This stuff shocked me, and I dont get wowed anymore that often. I love the longevity it gives me and allows my foundation to appear freshly applied all day. It actually makes my Doublewear more skin like on days I need more coverage. It doesn't cake or crease, it's really lovely. I have dry skin and live in cold climate in winter temps dip below zero..still looked great!! Have yet to try summer heat. It really improved look of the few lines I have started to get. I am very diligent with my skincare so prep is everything b4 foundation.  But gorgeous product. Love everything about it. I tried it with some of my points so check if they have a sealed sample. The sample size gave me 3 weeks of product. Oh..U don't need more than pea sized amount for yr face.",4
"I am in my mid 40's and have used many brushes in my lifetime.  I have had several Sephora brushes for a few years, and this is one of my favorites, much better than the high-end brushes I've owned.  This brush is large and soft.  I use it to apply powder, which it does lightly so as to perfectly set my foundation. I cannot tell you how perfect I find this brush.",3
"I am in my mid twenties and my skin's texture is an ongoing issue. I have sensitive combination skin with a lot of rough patches, so I have to exfoliate quite a bit to get that ""radiant"" look. I'm just starting out with direct acids and was really excited to try this. I used it after cleansing with my Clarisonic and didn't feel any stinging or burning, even on my sensitive skin. The smell is a bit medicinal, but that's to be expected. I rinsed after three minutes and could already tell an improvement, and when I moisturized it gliding on and soaked in much faster than it usually does. The large pores on my nose and cheeks are noticeably smaller and the rough texture is dwindling! Love this stuff and it definitely has a place in my skincare routine from now on.",3
I am in the process of trying to find the best anti-aging night cream and so far I really like the way this product feels on my skin.  The pump feature is pretty unique; it is less likely to use more product than necessary.  The next morning my skin does not feel greasy and I feel like I look more refreshed.  The product seems to absorb better than some of the other products I have used.,0
"I am kind of on the fence with this foundation.  I have medium skin tone with neutral undertones, with normal/combination skin type and rosacea. I have both the 260N and 360N shades.  One is too light, the other a little too dark, so I mix both of them.  I apply this with my sponge and I can build up coverage to cover my redness.  However, no matter how I prime or set, my face gets shiny in just 3-4 hours.  I do like that it is long wearing but I do not like that it does not work well to control my oiliness.  Also, I can ""feel"" like I am wearing it.  I will continue using it more when the weather is cooler and see if it will work better for me then.  For the warmer weather, I use my Chanel ULTRA LE TEINT \nUltrawear All-Day Comfort Flawless Finish Foundation (shade BR42).  The shade is perfect and I love how it feels like I am wearing nothing!",2
"I am light skinned with neutral undertones, over 55, and this bronzer and highlight is just beautiful on my skin. It starts off being light, but I just go over it once more and it turns out beautiful and just the right amount on. It is not that shimmery and diffentialy not orange at all.\nYou could go light or keep reapplying for more, it looks good either way. The highlight just looks natural on and I really like how natural it looks on the skin.\nI have tried many I mean many drug store and high end, but I really like Charlotte Tilbury's the best. \nI really didn't want to pay the price but I went ahead and I am so so glad I did. I have a feeling this is going to last me for a long time.",3
"I am loving EVERYTHING in this bundle.  The deal is amazing,  you save more than you pay.  My FD avarice thing is the highlighters,  they are creamy,  pigmented,  but sadly not very long wearing. Theist it great for refreshing your face, it's hydrating, but doesn't really work as setting spray in my opinion. The lip rescue really doesn't give much color,  but it is very shiny. And it only stays on for about 20 minutes tops,  but I am still very satisfied.",2
"I am loving this skin caring, matte foundation! It applies evenly and smoothly and the rosehip feels so good and smells so nice...and the coverage is perfect for my discoloration- somehow it mattifies my oily T zone, yet still gives a healthy slight glow overall, though this is definitely a matte formula and not the glowy. It doesn't settle into my fine lines or pores, and works great on its own and with my primer (s) - I've tried it with several. I don't notice it darkening or changing throughout my long day, although my setting powder may help as well. I will definitely be purchasing this again!! A little goes a long way so it's worth the money to me. This product was received complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and in exchange of my honest review. So happy I got to try this great product.!",2
I am new to toners but this works. it helps with oil and shine and I have noticed my blackheads are slowly disappearing. I also use the day cream and it works nice together. 1 star off for the smell. the whole line smells like toilet bowl cleaner to me. I don't know if this will keep me from repurchasing though.,2
"I am not a fan of liquid lipsticks, they are always drying. This is not drying, and it lasted thru my teeth cleaning. Dental hygienist asked for the brand name so she could buy. I definitely will be buying more colors.",2
"I am not a lip gloss fan, however I kept seeing it reviewed on YouTube so I decided to try it. Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb in Fu$$y is awesome. It's not sticky or gloppy. Just the right amount of shimmer and color. Moisturizing on the lips.",3
"I am not good with eyeliner pencils, so I wanted to try this eyeliner.  Good news is that it stays on a long time; bad news is that once it is on, you cannot smudge it or move it at all.  Once it is on, you cannot remove it until you remove your makeup.",3
I am not normally one to write reviews.  I am 50  and have some dark spots on my face.  I received a sample of this with a order a while ago.  I spot treated one of the dark spots using a very small amount on a q-tip and within 2 days the spot has lightened so much.  I am a believer and will take the leap to purchase the full size.,3
"I am not one to write reviews often but this is one product that I want to tell the world about! it was seriously a game changer for me and will ALWAYS be part of my make up routine! #holygrail\nI have very oily eye lids and I love trying different eye shadow looks and sometimes those looks take time, so you can imagine my frustration when I'd put in all that work, then by the time I get to work or wherever I'm going, I already had a crease...even with the best and most expensive types of eye shadow. I tried using concealer - hated it! I also tried other types of eye lid primer such a urban decay or too faced (and I am a too faced girl for pretty much all of my other make up) but nothing compared to this. I can work a 12 hour shift and still have perfect eye shadow when I get home. It is amazing!!! I originally got this as a sample in one of my monthly subscription boxes/bags...I think it was Sephora Play...but either way, I've not been without it since! If you have any issues with your eyeshadow creasing or oily eyelids...BUY IT NOW!!! I promise you won't regret it!!!",1
"I am not the type to be consistent in my skin care product use, but I think this product will change that. I've gone a few days WITHOUT using it and my skin feels kind of rough and patchy. On the days that I used the Lancer Soothe and Hydrate Serum my skin felt very smooth and soft. The feel of the serum is moist yet not greasy and it spreads on easily. The push pen applicator gives you just the amount you need.",2
"I am obsessed with benefits brow and lash products, and use them exclusively, do I decided to give this product a try. Since this is purely liquid, a little goes a long way and it is incredibly pigmented. I have really fair skin so I use one or two drops on my cheeks and rub it in slightly with my fingers. The result is a much more natural dewy looking pink tint than with a pressed powder or cream/stick blush.\nI also use this on my lips and one light swipe is enough to instantly stain the lips. However this product makes lips extremely red and leaves them very dry. I recommend using a balm on your lips under this before applying.",1
"I am obsessed with Sephora's commitment to clean beauty, and this product does not disappoint. I waited two weeks to review, and I can say I have noticed a difference, both in line reduction and brightening. I have sensitive skin and this was not at all irritating. And the price point in great!",3
"I am obsessed with these for a quick fix. they definitely do as claim, remove oil without taking off makeup and keeps you looking matte. the problem I'm having is it's very short lived. with these papers vs others I have tried..I seem to only be oil free/matte for like an hour MAX :/",2
"I am OBSESSED with these tanning drops.  I've never really consistently used self tanner for several reasons (I felt orange and unnatural, it was messy, my hands stained, it was a hassle to let it dry, it got on my sheets and clothes, etc.).  These are so low maintenance, subtle, and natural-looking that they allow me to keep up a self tanning routine on a regular basis.  I love that I can just put a few drops into my normal moisturizer, blend it in my hands, and get a subtle glow.  These tanning drops have never stained my hands or made me blotchy like other self tanners have.  They also have never rubbed off on my clothes or sheets.  The light shade gives you the perfect natural glow.  Love them and highly recommend if you're looking for a natural-looking, subtle self tanner that doesn't look fake.",0
"I am obsessed with this foundation! My fave I've tried recently, and will definitely be my go-to unless they stop making it or carrying it at sephora. I like a medium buildable coverage that's not too matte, and this is exactly that. It blends very nicely into your skin if you use just a little, but can be layered to cover blemishes too. I set it with powder and it lasts a long time. You may have to add more powder if you're oily. It didn't make me break out or anything. The only thing is, I'm not sure how long one tube will last - I've had mine a month and wear it every day and still have some left though. I tried the Milk blur foundation and really hated it as it creased and seemed to come off very fast for me, so I tried this one and it's awesome. I have tan/asian skin which honestly is more of a yellow undertone, but most foundations are too yellow, so Almond was the perfect shade for me.",0
I am obsessed with this product! first time trying ysl skincare and I'm hooked. my skin looked better after just a few days of use. I love the packaging too super sleek and chic. will definitely repurchase,1
"I am obsessed with what this mask does for my skin. Not only does it shrink pores around nose and blackheads on my nose, but it has reduced the size/lifespan of pimples I get. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't make my skin feel tight or red/inflamed. I use this at night twice a week before I shower, and the next morning my skin looks amazing. Plus it is cheaper, more effective and less offensive smelling than GlamGlow Super Mud. Just buy this already, your skin will thank you.",0
"I am on day 2 of night and day use. I didn't expect to see a difference so soon. I have dry skin, which contributes to fine lines and wrinkles. Under eye skin has improvement in firmness, and skin absorbs the moisture so well. It feels and looks great. Excited to see what the next month brings!",3
I am only giving this serum 3 stars. I received a sample of this from Influenster to try out for testing purposes. The sample only lasted me a few days so I cannot say if I saw any results from using it. It didn’t have a nice smell and it was nice and smooth on my face. I didn’t break out from using it. I would have to test it for a longer time period before giving a better review.,2
"I am on week 2 and I see significant growth of my brows and lashes already!My boyfriend even commented and assumed I was wearing false lashes, and I wasn't! only thing I don't like, I have accidentally gotten it in my eyes, it burns very bad. other than that it is an amazing product",0
"I am pale pale pale. Quite a few foundations don't make shades pale enough for me. That being said, it was nice to have a shade that will work for me even in winter. If you are looking for a full coverage foundation, this isn't it. It is buildable but really only to medium coverage. The foundation can be slippery if you don't prep right. I use a primer, apply foundation (use a brush for medium coverage and a beauty blender for sheer) and then a setting spray. Set with powder and spray again.  If I prime and set right, it lasts me all day. If I don't, it slips off my t zone by lunch. The finish is soft and luminous without being shiny. She's a beautiful foundation if you work with her. For reference, I have true combo skin - oily across my nose and chin, dry on my forehead, normal on my cheeks.",4
"I am pleased with the results of this product.  My daughter has oily skin and really bad breakouts. She used the product once a week in the beginning and now twice a week. It has cleared up her face tremendously. The only drawback we have seen is it is drying, but the amazing results with the absence of breakouts outweigh that issue. I would give it 5 stars if not for the dryness that it causes and the high price.",3
"I am really enjoying this palette. Mattes are smooth and blend out easily. The shimmers are very pretty and work well with each other and with the mattes. Wear time was good and I didn't experience a ton of fall out when applying. Lots of unique combinations are possible. My only gripe is I wish there was a dark matte blue in place of one of the oranges, and a lighter matte shade as well. It's not a standalone palette for me despite the many shades, but I still love it. I discovered by accident that the pans are easily removable and popped into a lighter/thinner magnetized palette. So for those who were hesitating because of the bulky packaging and the shades sitting on top of each other when the palette is closed, here is a great solution to make this more portable and easy to use. I used an Inglot magnet to take them out and it couldn't have been easier.",3
I am really enjoying this smoothing cream.  I love that it's not heavy. Its easy to apply and makes my skin feel hydrated and much smoother. I smell a light floral scent which I really like.  I think of my face as a canvas and feel you must start with the correct products before you start applying makeup.  Shiseido continues to bring me the products I need to get the results I am after.  I highly recommend this product.,3
"I am really enjoying wearing these PAT MCGRATH LABS\nLUST: Lip Glosses. They are comfortable to wear (not sticky), and look quite beautiful on. \nI love her shimmer and glitter glosses, but I also very much like some of her less shimmery ones such as Prima Donna, and Divine Rose. I went back and forth about getting Prima Donna during the Rouge sale event, but I'm glad I did! Such a fun pop of pink without being too bubblegum-y.\nEarth Angel, Bronze Divinity and Love Potion are also recent additions to my Lust Gloss collection. I have been enjoying wearing Bronze Divinity so much more than I'd even thought I would. Such a unique shade, and it looks terrific even with my very fair skin.\nAll of these can stand on their own, but they layer beautifully as well (why wear just one, when you can mix and match? LOL).",0
"I am really impressed with is foundation.  I love the natural finish it gives my skin. It also looks so natural on my skin. It has enough coverage to cover my small defects but still makes my skin look like skin. I never have any issues with this breaking apart, it looks beautiful all day. I tend to have that issue with a lot of foundations make me picky with what I like. This is great for running out the door because it is so easy to blend into the skin. It has SPF so I can skip a skin care step if I am running late. I find this never settles in my fine lines. My favorite way to use this foundation is to spread it lightly with my finger on my skin and then press it in with a sponge. I have used it with just a brush and just a sponge they both give a beautiful finish. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful everyday / every occasion foundation. I received this product free for my review.",2
I am really loving these pads. I use them once a week. You feel a slight tingle so you know it's doing something but it doesn't burn.I also love that its quick! I recieved this compliments of influencer for testing and review purposes.,1
I am really loving this sampler. I purchased a second set and I am seriously considering buying another one or two. It's a great deal for a wide variety of masks. I also like to throw a mask or two into the little gift baskets I make for my friends.,4
"I am really not a fan of this moisturizer. It feels thick and heavy which I don't mind for at night, but my skin is a lot more dry than it is with my Drunk Elephant or Tarte moisturizer, both of which are lighter and do a much better job, day and night. I used this stuff for a week and a half and my skin is now flaking like crazy. The ingredients are decent but the outcome for me is not.",0
"I am really picky about my skincare and I’ve used Amore Pacific products before and been disappointed. I got this as a sample and I was blown away! Within two weeks, my skin was more even and my other products seemed to work better. I really didn’t want to spend the money for the full sized product; but I could tell the difference when my sample was gone, so I splurged. I know you are to use a cotton pad to apply it, but it really lasts longer if you put a couple drops on your palm and press it into your skin. I’ve had my bottle for several months and have only used about a third!",2
"I am sad this doesn't work for me. The product itself has great ingredients and is soothing on the skin. There is a slight smell but nothing overpowering. The issue I have ran into is that it is very oily on my (normal/combo t-zone) face. It will eventually soak in but takes a while so I am unable to use it in the morning. It makes my foundation slide right off if used within two hours of applying the serum. Using it at night, I have noticed my skin feels soft and plump. This would probably work great on really dry skin or with your winter regimen. The oilyness plus the price point will have me sticking with Kate Somerville Biomimicking serum.",2
"I am seriously in love with this set. It has its own pouch, the bowl is made out of silicone (which at first I was like why? But it actually makes sense and works great.) I'm a huge mask fan, I love sheet masks, clay masks, fruit masks, DIY masks, and this set is great for it all! \n\nPROTIP: This set is small enough to travel with! With everything in the set plenty of room in the pouch still and it is all small! WIN WIN!",3
"I am shocked about how much this did not work for my dry skin! After reading reviews, I was really excited to try this product and once I put it on my face, I instantly wanted to take it off. The smell was a breaker for me. I usually don't mind fragrance and would never return a product for that reason until I smelled the cotton-candy cough syrup smell of this product. It also did not blend into my skin which was equally surprising and disappointing.",3
"I am shocked by the positive reviews. This is by far the worst foundation I've ever used in my life. It makes every wrinkle, pore, and flake of dry skin magnified. It even coated each individual little peach fuzz hair on my face. I looked in my visor mirror with the sun shining in on me and I saw Grizzly Adams staring back. I'm aware the vast majority of you will have to Google Grizzly Adams.",2
"I am shocked. SHOCKED. At how well these blotting papers work. Recently my skin has been extra oily during the day at work and I decided to invest in blotting papers rather than trying to mess with my skincare/makeup routine (I have sensitive skin and a delicate routine). After reading some reviews I settled on these, and let me tell you, what a MIRACLE PRODUCT. I used one paper for my whole face and every bit of oil was taken away. And the even better part was that my makeup was untouched and looked great after. I am so thrilled and I think these are my new staple item.",0
I am so glad I finally found something to clear my chest and back. This stuff works and a little goes a long way.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and not over dried or stripped. I just wish it wasnt so expensive. I'm using it in prep for my wedding and may not repurchase after get through the wedding day.,1
"I am so glad this palette went on sale as I could not justify the full price.\nIt is bigger than her mini palettes which is great. The formula is great in both the metallics and matte shades. The metallics stand out though as they are gorgeous. \nI think this palette will be perfect for the coming holiday season, its super pigmented and the colors are perfect.",2
"I am so glad to have purchased this 9 Ways to Shine Face Wardrobe by Tarte. I love that it is packaged into stacks rather than in a palette. Each stack / component is a different color so you can easily identify what is inside without having to open them. \n\nThis set is not universally flattering. Some shades are too dark for very fair skin, and others are too light for deep skin tones. I will get good use out of most shades as I am quite fair in winter months but more tan in the summer. \n\nThe only dud in the bunch is the Peppermint Mocha bronzer. It is very pigmented but it does not blend at all. No matter how much you blend, it looks blotchy and uneven. All other shades perform beautifully.",4
"I am so happy to have found this eye cream. I've got a drawer full of ones that have done nothing for me.  While I'm not getting the results that many of you have with bright eyes in the am, I am seeing a huge improvement in my milia under my eyes. I had actually given up that any product would help and was planning an Appt at the dermatologist.  Nope. Don't need to now, they are barely visible after using for a couple of weeks.  Hopefully they will be gone completely after more time using this.  Great packaging too and the kid in me just loves using the little spoon!",3
"I am so impressed with this palette, every shade in the palette is super vibrant when apply, easy to blend and layer on top each other. What you see in the pan will be the same when applied to the lid, except one shade A1 it is the only dud for me, it is a nice color but it is a dulI satin, I wish it is creamier in terms of texture, and shiner/add more micro glitters in it, then this palette will be A+++ in my books. \nA1 is still usable can be use as a purply highlighter for fair to light skin tone, but may not be usable for mid to deeper skin tone I think it might look ashy. After giving the the shade multiple try, I suggest applying it to a sticky base with fingers to get the most punch out of it.",0
"I am so impressed with this product. My regular skincare routine didn't include SPF, which I felt guilty about, but most of the SPF products I'd tried were greasy or heavy and I didn't want that on my face. These drops are a GREAT addition. I use them after my moisturizer, before foundation. It absorbs quickly and leave my face smooth and ready for makeup! I do wish it were reef-safe/didn't have avobenzone in it, but since I don't live near a reef, it works for me. (I received a free product from the company to try, but I honestly really love this!)",1
"I am so in love with this beautiful palette! Every color is gorgeous and blends beautifully. I was hunting for a warm palette that I could use for every occasion, with blend ability and without talc. This is my holy grail eyeshadow palette!!!",1
"i am so in love with this oil, i have really dry skin and rosacea and this has truly been a miracle product for me. my skin has never looked better, i put this on after washing my face at night before using my moisturizer and eye cream and also in the morning before i put on my make up and it has made a HUGE difference for me. The price is perfect for the amount of oil you're getting since a little goes quite a way",0
I am so in love with this palette. I think it fits perfectly in every season. i think because of the icy tones in it makes it a great winter palette. i experienced very little fall out and only with some of the shimmer shades. It wasn't bad though. The mattes blended beautifully and i didn't experience any muddiness. i have her new nudes palette as well and i don't think theres any duplicates in them. I feel like this is a stand out palette in my sea of palettes that I own. i have alot. That nebula shade is absolutely stunning popped in the middle over another eyeshadow. Beautiful pigmentation too. I can't get over how pretty this palette is and the performance is just as great!,1
"I am SO in love with this product!! I selected the Deep 59 thinking I could use it as contour and when I tried it out it was too light to be a contour. So, I used it as foundation and I was shocked at how nice and smoothly it blended with my skin without it being too dark. A little went a long way, it's super lightweight so you can't really feel it on your face at all. It's the type of product you'd have to go inside the store to test out and get your perfect color. But overall 10/10 and I definitely recommend it!",4
"I am so obsessed with this mist, I find myself spraying it on numerous times daily because it just feels so nice and hydrating without getting sticky or built up.  I will never go without this product ever again. This is by far the beat product I have ever tried from Dr. Jart and would give this 100 stars if I could.  I highly recommend this product and especially in conjunction with the tiger grass gel cream.  I did receive this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.",1
I am sorry that  the perfectly flawless was discontinued but I find this almost the exact same and I do like it and the coverage I get.  I read the other reviews that others find it flakes and is dry but for me I have no issues with it and I am 55yrs with very minimal wrinkles and creases.,3
"I am still working through all the colors but here are my first impressions: this is a versatile palette that works wonderfully for the fall/winter months. I found all the colors to be very blendable, and you get a sense of the different textures in the pan as you dip your brush into the mattes, satins, and glitters (they feel almost gel-like). I was surprised that each color registers differently on the eyes. You really have to play with the shadows to get a sense of the true color. A color like Destino, for example, is actually much brighter and illuminating on than in the pan. The glitter shades are really transformative - they can take any of the other shadows and create a new color, with the exception of Reina which lets the base color push through. It is a ""super"" glitter for sure! Really packs a punch, you barely need any at all! Also, the packaging is just gorgeous in this palette! Overall, I'm loving this new KVD palette!",0
"I am surprised at how much I love this palette. I usually wear very natural neutral makeup, so this was me outside safe box. I have to say, I'm amazed at how good this looks on brown Indian skin. I have used it on my eyes, as a highlighter, on my lips, basically everywhere. I always worried that a dark blue would make my eyes look hooded and dark, but it absolutely does not! the colours are so beautifully pigmented and rich. I would highly recommend trying this one out. I'm adding a picture of it on my eyes and cheekbones. no mascara, no other products, just this palette.",4
"I am surprised I like this palette as much as I do. The reasons: reviews I read/saw said to get the Malika palette as there is no colour payoff with this one. Wrong. NOT a Kardashian fan and underwhelmed by the makeup products put out by this family (among other reasons) and for that reason alone I wanted to skip it. I had a Sephora SA use both palettes on me and the Malika was too orange and generally too obvious on my skin (I wear Hourglass Vanish Stick in Shell, MAC NC-25 for reference). What i really liked about this palette was that it does give a great glow that can (if you like) be built up. It made me look like I'd just come back from an island vacation in the best possible way. I think if you are fair to even medium skin, you should consider this.",3
"I am usually a little nervous when trying a sample of a beauty product because they usually don’t work or live up to the name. This was not the case. I noticed a difference after the first use. Smooth, smaller pores and my skin felt great. I would buy if the price wasn’t so expensive.",0
"I am usually not one to write a review, but this product deserves one. I often wake up with dark puffy eyes in the morning, despite using a variety of different eye creams which have costed me waaay too much. Although this one is pricey, it is WORTH IT. My eyes are significantly less puffy and less dry after only ONE night. I got this in a gift set and will certainly be buying it once I've run out. I can't wait to see the long term effects on my eye area!",4
"I am very fair and don't like a lot of highlighters that are too shiny, glittery, or dark. This palette is perfection. I use every pan and it's never too much, just glowy and perfect.  Even the bronzer is the perfect tone, and I've only ever found one other bronzer that I liked.",4
I am very happy with this mask so far! The retinol in it has not dried out my skin or caused any irritation at all. the ingredients are great and very nourishing for your skin so I'm not surprised. Retinol is the only thing proven to reverse damage (wrinkles) once it has been made but it does require some patience. Bug so far I have been loving it and I wake up with smooth and plump skin the next morning so I'm excited to see how good my skin looks in a few months!,4
I am very picky about the products I use and they have to actually significantly do what they claim to do.  This is truly the first product that I have seen visible results in.  My dark circles still show some darkness but it is drastically less.  I could probably just use a light concealer to cover the lighter dark circles now.  I will definitely repurchase!,2
"I am very pleasantly surprised by this setting powder! It really does prolong the wear of my foundation and doesn't make my already day skin feel like a desert. I don't feel like it emphasizes my fine lines any more than other powders. I am a ultra fair and the vanilla shade is actually great for my skin tone and doesn't turn my foundation orange/yellow like some powders. The only issue I have is it can remove a little coverage from my foundation, but that is a problem I have with most powders.",1
I am very pleased with this palette. I think the bronzer is gorgeous. I didn't care for tickle but other than that I really liked it. Hoola might be my new favorite product for my nose contour. It blends out beautifully. I think it's worth the price.,2
"I am wanting to see a difference in some texture that has recently appeared under my eyes. I do not recommend doing this but I exfoliated first before washing it off, let my face dry, then put this on. it stung as bad as rf treatments (without numbing cream) an it is not worth it for my forehead wrinkles anyway. But, I will say after 5-7 treatments, I have great skin except where I just need fillers under my eyes.",2
"I am writing about only this one color, which failed me.I have bought many other U.D. waterproof liner pencils, that had shimmer. Those had worked great! This year, I decided to buy a matte, deep brown. Bad results, I have to go over my line 3X, for it to show up. My biggest problem, is the inner eye, with it. Smashboxe's 24 hr. waterproof gel pencil  liner is more opaque, goes on faster. I line once!! Rimmel's Scandal Eyes pencil liner is better! Do not buy the Demolition color. Where is the pigment? I do like U.D. matte blacks. It must be just this one color, that is off.",4
"I applied this before bed and when my husband came in the room he immediately asked “what’s that smell?”  After a few hours the normal self tanner smell was pretty strong. The next morning and a shower later, you can still smell it.  It was super sticky and I felt weird going to bed wearing it. The lotion also seems to be drying as my lips feel dehydrated this morning— not a normal feeling for my lips usually. It is not a gradual tanner as some reviews are saying. This was a medium tan after one use. I do feel like I look orangeish, but I do look more tan. This lotion is nothing special. Works, smells, and tans like almost every other lotion.",0
"I appreciate that it is a clean product, but what good is clean if it doesn't work.  This works. Very fine mist.  Hydrating without being sticky. I'm using this as a face primer, a setting spray, a mid-day hydrator and a ""it's hot I really would like to splash water on my face but don't want to mess up the makeup"" refresher.  I find myself reaching for this throughout the day, and am going to be buying extra bottles to keep in my office as well as in my home. Love. Love. Love.",2
"I appreciate the instant glow this gives and how lightweight the formula feels. I was expecting a heavier feel from the dimethicone, but this layers well in my daytime routine with no texture or pilling. My usual redness is much calmer since adding the Light Up serum. It's too early to share long term results, but for now, consider me happy with these short term results!\nI received this product as a free sample.",4
"I believe this is a natural bristle brush and I'm pretty annoyed that wasn't mentioned in the description as I would have passed on this highly rated brush and saved myself the frustration and money. The bristles are coarse, grossly coloured (yellowish-beigish-grey-brownish) and are way too long, which made for very sloppy and clumpy product application for detailed brow work. In this one case, I did use ABH's dip brow pomade, which were supposedly made for each other. The ferrule is crimped such that the width of the bristles aren't uniform, there is a narrowing right in the middle, contributing to the problem. Not soft at all. There is no salvaging this brush.",3
"I bit the bullet and finally bought this during the November VIB sale. I have chapped lips all year, but winter is obviously worse. I love the subtle natural vanilla scent, I wake up and my lips are nourished and I have tried a bajillion lip balms in my years and this is the best one. It's pricey, sure, but it's a really big jar and it's cruelty free so I'm glad I made this investment finally.",1
"I bought 1N2 ecru. I love the color and skin like finish of it. Especially for dry winter skin. I'm normally combo/oily a little drier in winter, it's great. I didn't have any oxidization like other reviews. Lasted a full work day 10 hrs. No creasing, cracking, or fading. Perfect!",2
"I bought 3 of these colours, the “Major Player”, “That Tan Life”, and “Well Baked”. All 3 are incredible! As usual, Nails Inc does not disappoint. I’ve got the Major Player and Well Baked on right now, painted 3 days ago and so far, no chips at all. I used the Nails Inc NailKale Base coat and Caviar Top Coat as usual. I did have to put two coats of the Well Baked because it was quite a bit thinner than I’m used to seeing with Nails Inc polish and when swatching I found that That Tan Life was on the thinner side as well. Major Player had the same consistency that I’m used to and only really needed one coat but for longevity, I applied two coats. \n\nI also find that if you make sure you put your base coat, polish and top coat on the tips and slightly underneath the tips of your nails then the polish will last much longer because you’ve got them wrapped. \n\nThe sparkle in these is incredible. The Major Player is not as sparkly as the other three but the colour is really pretty (not as pink but more nude then it shows online) and they all look amazing in the sun with a tan. \n\nThese are definitely worth the extra cost compared to the drugstore brands because the brush is much wider and rounded so you can cover your entire nail with 1-3 swipes. They also dry quickly as long as you don’t put heavy coats on them (which you shouldn’t be doing anyway) so you can have your nails done very quickly, especially if you’re using the Nails Inc Caviar 45 Second Top Coat. I’m now here to buy the fourth colour as I know I’ll be getting a lot of use out of this set since they’ll also be great for Christmas! \n\nNails Inc hits it of the the park again!",3
"I bought a couple of these travel sizes and now I'm upgrading to the big bottle because I can't help but use so much of it so often. it feels great and I can see a difference being made, my skin is more moisturized and throughout the day its just nice to use for a boost",0
I bought all of them. I love each of them and unfortunately they don't swatch well but they apply beautifully on the face with the right brush. You will not look like a clown with these blushes. I love the way each of them look on my face. I highly recommend them!!,3
"I bought Amal & Jen. First thing I noticed when I opened them was that both pull way more brown than pictured. Jen is being returned because I have at least a dozen other sticks and stains, mattes and satins in that shade - it's pretty and the formula & texture are lovely but I can't justify another of the same color at this price. When I do run out of all my others, I'll probably replace them with this. I thought it was going to be a touch lighter and pinker. Amal is beautiful but not at all the bold deep dark pink as pictured (even in the CT website). It's more of a deep rosewood. Not bold at all. Understated and classy. It's the most confortable long lasting matte bullet lipstick I've ever worn. It's still creamy-feeling hours after application - and it's matte! It leaves a beautiful stain behind when it does wear off. I want to check her other lipsticks in store to see if any of the other lines do have a rich, bright pink, but my local store doesn't carry her line.",3
I bought a sephora play box and there was a small sample of this.  at first this tastes and smells good but then immediately after there is an extremely bitter taste.  im not sure if I got a bad batch?,3
"I bought a smoothing and brightening set from perricone MD which included this item. I was very excited to try this brand because of the reputation but I was not just disappointed, I was horrified by the results. I have never broken out this bad even in my teen years. My skin became scaly with what seemed like burn spots that would cake over and flake off leaving a dry, reddened area that no concealer or powder would cover. I hated these products and regret buying them. They were used as directed and created more problems than I could have imagined. None of the other make up that I have invested in ever looked the same on my fave while using it, it was awful.",2
"I bought four, was so excited when they were delivered. I knew logically I would get at least one duplicate.  The lip products are all awesome but all 4 bags I got were absolutely identical down to the pin. At least my mystery was the NARS so I got the one I was most excited about.",2
"I bought G50+ for winter- it's an exact match to the center of my face. G60+ is slightly more yellow, but rounds everything out, esp my hyperpigmentation. Very little product goes along way and it works amazingly with my Becca palettes. If not set with the CoverFx rice-based powder around my nose and mouth, it will separate a bit...I'm in Miami. Definitely moisturize well and have a good skin care routine, and it will not bring attn to dry areas or texture.",2
"I bought Gleam Girl and it's my new FAVORITE liquid eyeshadow.  It lasted 12 hours, no streaking, just a beautiful shimmer and I was impressed with the formula. looks like other shades were not that successful,  but Gleam Girl was impressive and stunning. Such a nice formula. Sounds like if you're going to buy it,  maybe consider the Gleam Girl only.",2
"I bought it because I loved the smell. I am planning to repurchase because it truly did what it said it would: it makes my face immediately feel refreshed, it adds a beautiful glow to my skin after cleansing (healthy glow). A plus: the mist spray is great!",4
"I  bought it because it was on sale and looked really pretty. It does not hydrate your lips at all. I don't even know how to describe the consistency but it adds nothing to your lips. It definitely needs to be more moist or something. Also, for the price there isn't much there.",4
"I bought it in ""melon"" yesterday and wore it today with the Sephora gel serum concealer in ""Butterscotch"". Astounded that it totally covered up any dark areas on my face. Why am I just discovering this amazing product now???",3
"I bought nude romantique. I feel mixed about the color. It looks darker in reality,  than the photo on my lips.  It looks like a golden light raspberry color in a metallic.   Light enough to wear everyday, but bold at the same time. There is a lot of mini glitter,  but you barely feel it when you press your lips together.",2
"I bought one of these about a year ago & I liked it however while trying to squeeze product out..it came out of the sides instead of the little hole. I thougt maybe I squeezed too hard or the product hardened. So I decided to buy another one and AGAIN the same thing happened. Now I have to return it..which I hate doing because I do 95% of my shopping online. Tarte get it together & fix this issue!,",2
I bought strictly due to the cuteness of the product \nhowever it works amazing! \nkeeps my lips soft in the New Mexico cold. \nit's not too greasy feeling or shiny just refreshing lip balm..it smells like watermelon but not overly sweet like other brands will buy again !,4
"I bought the 5 sampler pack of the Peter Thomas Roth Masks, which included this mask. I have sensitive acne prone skin, which can get very dry during the winter. As soon as my face gets flaky and angry I use this mask or the cucumber, either during the whole day if Im staying in or overnight otherwise. It smells so nice and you dont really need much, its feels a bit itchy as its drying, dont know what its from, but it feels like something is working. This would usually be concerning for my sensitive skin, but when I wash this off my face is rehydrated, no flakes! Calms any acne flares up that I may have gotten from the over drying. Most products make me break out so its great to find something so hydrating that can sooth my flare ups instead of causing more. This is a real god sent when skin goes awry. Love it!",0
"I bought the big one hoping it would be what people say it is. I use skin food peach sake toner then use SKII essence and then epiduo and my skin has been much better I used to get horrible cystic acne and the 3 combined has helped a lot. Epiduo makes my skin dry and flaky but using skII with it balanced it out so now my skin is clear, more even, soft and moisturized.",0
"I bought the full size after liking the non-tinted version. And I’m not sure what this product is trying to be. If I use a little bit of it, it goes on well and gives me a nice flush of color, kind of like if I put on a little bit of bronzer. That’s all great, but I KNOW that little bit is NOT going to give me sufficient sun protection. (And I bought this to be used as a sunscreen, not as a bronzer.) So I put on more, but then the product doesn’t apply well and leaves ugly streaks across my face. Very similar to steaks from having too much liquid foundation on my face. So it is a very cosmetically inelegant sunscreen, and doesn’t quite cut it as a bb cream.",1
"I bought the green to help with sun damage I have on my neck. It does cover the red, but I've yet to be able to get a small enough amount to not turn my neck very green. I've used to smallest amount I could get out of the tube, but I think I need to wipe some off onto a towel first to get less coverage.  This has possibilities and I'm curious about trying a different color. I did not try it on my face, only on my neck.",3
"I bought the large pot of this in store after I had an allergic reaction to something I ate, and my eyes swelled up, resulting in the skin being stretched and dried out. this was the ONLY thing that helped my dry, literally flaking eyelids. it goes on so creamy and then turns into a water gel type substance?? I love it. I'll never use anything else.",1
"I bought the larger size after trying this moisturizer in the sun kit. I love it! It's light, moisturizing and not greasy and smells good. It absorbs nicely and doesn't feel heavy. However, the jar is much smaller than the lid. There's way more plastic than needed for the amount of product. Also, the jar lid is cumbersome. The smaller jar is a conventional package, small lid, bigger container and opens easily. This one doesn't, is a pain to open and not simple to use. Once you open the box and jar you almost feel that it's deceptive as well as wasteful.",2
"I bought the mini collection which included 4 products. I loved the Phoenix oil and the facial spray was nice, but this moisturizer and the mask were my least favorite products. I have sensitive, combination skin and while I didnt have any initial reactions to this (no redness or irritation) I did end up with breakouts which are pretty rare for me. It does have shea butter in it and while that works great in body moisturizers I think it's too heavy for my face and clogged my pores. It was the only new product I had introduced at the time so pretty sure it was the culprit. As for the product itself, it did feel like it sat on my skin as other reviewers have noted. The fragrance was a little strong for me when I'd first put it on (again I'm very sensitive and can only wear a few perfumes), but went away very quickly. I used the remainder of the product as a hand cream which worked well on my parched hands in winter. Clearly this product has worked well for other reviewers and I imagine would be nice for very dry skin (or even as a hair mask), just not the right fit for my skin.",2
"I bought the mini of this and I loved it, so I decided to get the bigger size.  I love the product no doubt about it but for the price I was disappointed in the size. I'm cool toned and to find that right match for contour is hard. I have lots of contours that are great but this is a perfect match.  It comes in a cute little velvety bag which IMO they should keep the bag and make the product bigger.",1
"I bought the mini to test it out and in 6 weeks my eyelashes were actually longer. So I bought a full size and now 10 weeks later they are thicker. I  didn't see results in a week, it took time but now when I curl my lashes they touch my eyebrows and people ask me if I have extensions. But here are some things I learned.\n1. I did experience itchy, red eyelids in the beginning so now if my eyes get irritated, i skip a night and it doesn't hault my progress.\n2. Im a side sleeper and I noticed the eyelashes on the side of my face that rests on the pillow was progressing slower . So I would try not to smoosh your face in the pillow like i did.",1
"I bought the Peach Perfect foundation about a month before I got this set. I was looking for a new setting powder and decided to try these since I love the foundation.  Everything in this kit works really well for my particular skin. The primer is wonderful and really helps with oil control.  I know some reviewers state that it pills, but I have not experienced this. The setting spray is also great.  I shake it like crazy and I have never gotten a white spot and my makeup doesn't budge for once.  The powder is one if the best I have used and the mascara works really well. I would personally reccomend this to combo/oily skinned people since everything in here is mattifying. Ladies with dry skin may find the products a bit drying.",3
"I bought the Pillow Talk eye shadow quad as well as the Vintage Vamp quad and love them both. The eyeshadow is very buttery and smooth and goes on light so you can build up the color. I find her eyeshadow palettes give a soft glowy look which really makes the eyes pop. I personally love that the shadows start soft and can really be built up, but for people who want heavy pigment from the first swipe these eyeshadow palettes might not be for them.  As to the price, it is a little high but the quality of the eyeshadows does justify it.  I think its as high a quality if not higher than many of the other luxury eye eyeshadow on the market and much higher quality than Tarte, Too Faced, Urban Decay etc.",1
"I bought the shade Eat Cake, the colour is fabulous, I tend to have a love hate relationship with rosey nudes as sometimes they can be too pink. This shade on the other hand is like a ""my lips but better"" very soft and classy. The shade is muted and has a glossy finish. A great everyday shade / work appropriate tone. I love the formula it's very moisturizing and doesn't settle into my lips lines. I did also try (and returned) Anais, although great formula the tone made me look dead, it's very pale and beige, if you have a yellow undertone like myself this will wash you out.",0
"I bought the soft glam palette 2 days ago in store without using it when I saw this vault. I saw it, then it sold out, then when I checked in the morning it said in stores near me. So I got in the car and went to my sephora right when they opened cause I knew it would sell out and returned my palette and got the vault. I am so happy with my purchase because this is such a good deal! You're basically getting 2 for the price of 1! I heard some people were having struggles with getting it online, so I would buy in store just to be safe, but I have no complaints! Great deal would reccomend",4
I bought the trial size with the cleanser and must say I loved the water cream. I used it for a week and it left my skin very moisturized. It absorbs quickly when applied and also has a slight tingling feeling but that quickly goes away too. My skin felt moisturized all day without getting greasy and wears well under makeup. I bought the full size after trying it. Definitely a staple.,4
I bought the whole set during Melt's one day sale. These palettes are especially wonderful. The mattes blend beautifully. The palettes each have their own color story but they also work together. The color payoff is amazing. it also lasts all day. I work a long day and frequently am putting makeup on at 6:30 am and this lasts until I take it off around 9 pm. I've used these almost every day since I received them. each time I've been able to create a new look with little effort and each look has resulted in compliments. I work a professional job and these palettes have complimented my professional attire versus making me look like I'm wearing a night time fancy look.,3
"I bought this a few months ago, and it's been working pretty good for me. I use it almost every night before I go to sleep on top of the laneige lip mask. it has a slight cooling felling on my lip and the texture is not too thick. it doesn't have any fragrance. this lip routine keep my lips hydrated till the next morning, but the lip mask itself can do this job as well. during the day, my lips are still dry from time to time, but thankfully they are not chapped any more. my main complaint about this product tho is the package. the blue plating on the bottom part of the tube falls into glittery flakes that stick on my hands. they look like dandruffs and they are gross. tissues don't get them off my hand because they are so small and sticky, so I have to wash my hand every time after I use this. it's pretty annoying for me because this is the last step of my night routine after I put on hand cream. eh.. just the package is enough to stop me buying this again.",0
"I bought this after a friend said she saw her dark circles lighten in just 2 weeks of using this product. I have pretty bad dark circles so I was willing to give it a try. I used this once a day for a month and have seen no improvement. One thing to note is that it doesn't absorb into the skin.. it's more of a gel consistency that sits on your skin, which i didn't like. It also burns a little if you get it too close to your eye. I'll be returning it.",0
"I bought this after an employee recommend this and the accompanying cleanser and toner to me for my oily, acne prone skin. While it did help control my oil, it wasn't a long term solution. Other than oil control when I was using it (if I missed a day my oils were out of control), this hydrator did nothing it claimed to do. It was the toner more than anything that helped my acne, but even that didnt reduce it, it just kept it from not getting worse. For the price and size I would not recommend it. I ended up switching when I learned from a different employee that my overly oily skin was not being helped by this hydrator, but actually getting worse as this doesn't hydrate as it should, even for oily skin. She said my skin wasn't getting enough moisture so it was over producing the oil itself. Once I switched, my skin (while still oily) wasn't near the grease ball it used to be.",4
I bought this after Karima McKimmie used it in a tutorial. It looks great on my eyes but the texture is not bouncy at all. It's quite firm with very little give in the pan. Did I get a dried out dud? Perhaps I need to exchange it. It's a lovely product and I think I would like it more if it had the texture everyone describes.,2
"I bought this after trying a number of setting sprays (Mac, urban decay, first aid, bareminerals, glamglow) and this has been by far my favorite.  I'm in my early 40's and depending on the day, may wear full coverage foundation or tinted moisturizer.  Usually I side on a more natural look, and luckily have good skin, but I love dewy skin looks.  This fits the bill- it melds my makeup together, fixes it for the day, and adds a beautiful glow.  Only negative is that I've gone through a bottle in a little over one month, because I have to use quite a few sprays to get product on my skin, and I'm not happy about spending that much a month for setting spray seeing as I have about 12 other bottles at home (but I won't lie, I'll buy it again unless something else can somehow beat this).",2
"I bought this as a Black Friday special, and would have given it a higher rating if there were actually ANY product in the primer tube. I squeezed and squeezed and about 3 drops came out. I purchased the set for that product with the others  as as stocking stuffer. They have not yet been used.",3
I bought this as a gift for a little girl who loves to play with glitter. It's perfect for her. It's not so great if you're looking for something comparable to the stila glitters. They are more on the sheer side.,4
"I bought this as a morning cleanser, looking for something very gentle and moisturizing to just take off all the products I put on at nite. My skin is normal to slightly oily.  For a ""moisture rich"" cleanser,  I find it too stripping to use in the morning.  However, it works very well with my Clarisonic at nite to take my makeup off.  Great cleanser, but not what I would at all call moisturizing.",3
"I bought this as a potential travel alternative to my Clarisonic. Good size and weight make it easily packable and the cover/stand is clever. The bristles are long and amazingly soft—but this combo means if you apply any pressure while you’re washing, the bristles squish down or collapse to the side. If you use it lightly (so as to not buckle the bristles), you wind up just lightly caressing your face with a very soft brush, which... is fine, I suppose. But not effective. If you have very sensitive skin, this might be up your alley but, if you’re used to the more robust cleansing and exfoliation of a Clarisonic, it’s worth exploring other options.",1
"I bought this as a splurge and I have oily/sensitive skin. this is such a fantastic hydrating facial mist that doesn't leave any greasy residue!! instead my face feels plump after and ready either for bed or for makeup application. when my moisturizer doesn't give me the juice I need, I use this as a finisher and it's just amazing. I like it a lot more than oily sprays like the tacha and Pixi glow mist.",0
"I bought this because I am going on vacation soon, and it was on sale so why not? The consistency of the oils are light and dry fairly quickly. You do have build it up a bit if you want an over the top glow, but if you're looking for a nice soft glow this product is perfect! I know alot of people hate the packaging because it pours out a lot. To get around that I kept the white sticker lid thing on and just poked a medium size hole in it. I get the perfect amount out for my use. The smell of the Ipanema Sunset oil is kind of overwhelming at first use, but you get used to it over time! I've started to use it under my makeup to add more glow to my face and I have to say I love it! Because it's a dry oil it doesn't make my makeup feel greasy and it leaves the most beautiful glowy look. I took one star off for the initial smell and packaging.\n\nOverall LOVE this oil!",4
"I bought this because I have sensitive skin and was hesitant about using a retinol. After I cleanse my face, I massage it in my hands and it truly sinks into my skin well. I've been using it a little over a month and my skin has been looking really nice, and it hasn't broken me out. I also feel like the price point is reasonable - $54 and I still have about 2/3 of the bottle left!",1
I bought this because I have straight Asian lashes that will not hold the curl unless I use waterproof mascara. This gives the volume but it smudges in about 2 hours for me. Returning and getting the other non-Blackout Christian Dior waterproof mascara.,3
"I bought this because I'm a sucker for shimmery shadows. It is super pigmented so you don't need a lot, so I definitely think its worth the price because it'll last forever. I didn't see a lot of fallout and it seems to last all day too! I want to buy all the colors!",4
"I bought this because it was on sale and I'm so glad I did.  I am a huge fan the the agave balm (original) and had heard so many bad reviews of the new formula but wanted to try for myself.  Its my second favorite, not quite as thick as the first but still like it a lot.",1
I bought this because it was on sale but I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like it! It applied well under my eyes for a slight brightening and didn’t crease for me. The color I chose is a little light for my face but it looked nice to cover slight darkness around my mouth when I used it with a orange/red color corrector. I would buy this again.,0
"I bought this because it was on sale, I never heard of this brand so I though I would give it a try. I love it-its moisturizing, not a gaudy color and it in a cute case. It isn't sticky or stinky :) It became a nice muted shade of coral on me. I can see using it all summer.",3
"I bought this because it was the same price as my buying the full sized moisturizer and wanted some free bonuses, and I'm so glad I did! The Tarte gel moisturizer always does more for my skin than any other product, and the toner and collagen serum and really blowing me away! \n\nMy skin has always been very dry on my cheeks and red/blotchy in these areas as well. Using all of these products together has made me fall really in love with them. My skin is soooo soft and but less patchy. and although I still maintain some redness it's refined to the cheek bones and look like I've been sunkissed. The lotion works very well on it's own, but I can tell that the collagen serum is really putting in the work giving me more moisture. The toner (fair warning that it does burn a bit - but not for long) is really wonderful at all. I usually use The Ordinary toner, which I love for the price and how well it works, and I think Tartes toner is a step above!\n\nAll around wonderful.",0
"I bought this because Tati really liked it, however it didn't hold up to my work conditions like my EL doublewear does. This went quite greasy on me within a few hours, but also somehow managed to catch on dry skin. I think if you have dry or lightly oily skin this will be a beautiful foundation, but it doesn't have the staying power of my doublewear so it got returned. Shade 320 was quite orange, I would have been better off with Bamboo.",1
I bought this because tI was told it's the recommended way to apply the translucent powder. I hated it. it applied way too much product and product ended up everywhere. I went back to my powder brush and problem fixed.,2
"I bought this brush on a recommendation.  You can apply foundation with it by stippling or smoothing it on with circular motions. However, due to its size, it’s hard to use it around the nose and eyes.",4
"I bought this brush on sale and glad I did it. I brought it with me when travelling to my hometown in Indonesia, my sister tried it and she wanted it! so I gave my brush. and now I buy again for me, this is a must have brush, I rarely use brush to apply foundation cause I found it leaves a streaky line but not with thia brush, flawlessly and effortless to build to a full coverage. If you want a full coverage get this brush, get this brush.",2
I bought this brush to replace one I've had for several years. This new brush is not at all the quality of the old one. The bristles are shorter and almost prickly. I used this brush for years to blend my under eye concealer. That's impossible with this new brush; it actually hurts the skin under my eyes.,2
I bought this cream for my son who had severe eczema on his hands for several months. We tried everything cream we could over the counter find as well as prescription. After the first night of use his eczema was significantly reduced and by day three it was GONE. This stuff is amazing and I will definitely be trying more products from the brand as well! Highly recommend!!,1
"I bought this cream for the first time earlier this month because it had great reviews. I am not disappointed at all! It is the first eye cream I use so I cannot compare it to other products but as an eye cream, it did reduce the bags under my eyes and brightened the area. Even my partner noticed a difference though he was not too sure what it was that ""made my eyes shine"". We just had a baby so you can imagine how bad I needed some help! I will definitely buy it again!",1
"I bought this during the November rouge sale. I have the beauty serum which I purchased earlier this year and am in LOVE with. I should have known I'd love this too. I've never heard of saint Jane before, but gave it a try bc I have dry skin. This body serum is soooo lux and so hydrating. I use it right after I shower and orrrrr leaves my skin soothed and supple all day. pretty sure this is going in my holy grail group of products.",2
"I bought this eye cream in the summer and found it to be really heavy. However, now that it's winter and my skin is really dry I am absolutely loving this cream. It leaves my eye area moisturized and supple, and I really like the way  my concealer applies on top (no creasing or caking). I would give it 5 stars if it worked for me year round or if the price was lower--it's a great eye cream but pricey for what it is.",2
"I bought this eyeliner in obsidian one week ago. I used it one time daily since then and it's empty now. I don't do anything elaborate, only line my top lid. The formula is great and I like the micro aspect, but seven days for 18 is dumb.",3
"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who loves glitter.  I used it for her unicorn Halloween costume (and my Poppy princess costume) and it did the job.  I applied the glitter with a brush over the adhesive and the glitter stayed pretty well.   While the glitter is for hair/body, I used it on our faces, and neither of us had allergic or any other kind of adverse reaction.  I would recommend doing a spot test first.  Also avoid getting it too close the eyes.",1
"I bought this for my daughter. She has T-Zone oiliness that turns into an oil slick extremely easy. She also suffers from acne.\n\nThis foundation covers her face beautifully. I've NEVER seen her face looking better! On days where she wants full coverage it's there. On days where she wants minimum coverage, she simply uses less and mixes it with a little light moisturizer.\n\nShe's used it almost everyday for almost 2 weeks now. The ONLY time she's broken out is when she forgets to take it off before bed. It's NOT the product's fault, rather it's hers. It doesn't make her face oily either.\n\nShe's tried NUMEROUS high end foundations, drug store foundations, and foundations somewhere in the middle. She said "" this is the BEST foundation she's EVER used."" I am inclined to agree with her. She looks beautiful in it!\n\nThis size will last her a VERY long time, so please consider that when you consider the price. It is well worth it!",4
"I bought this for my product obsessed daughter who is in school to be an esthetician. She tried it out on herself without steaming, exfoliating, etc. and didn't receive favorable results. She was doing a facial on me that evening and used it and realized it's actually amazing, and long as you prep the face. It is not a magic wand ladies! we have to get those pores softened and prepped to let this do its job!",2
I bought this for myself for my birthday as I'm now in my 30's and just had a baby. I've actually had a microcurrent facial before so was intrigued to get similar results at home. \n\nI'm extremely disappointed with my whole experience with this product at Sephora. I had the NuFace for less than 2 months before the Eye,0
"I bought this for the bag! \nscrubber: nice to have (for brushes too)\ncleanser: makes my face super soft and nice!\neyeshadow: love the shades, smells like chocolate?\nmascara: havnt used yet\nlip balm: a nice subtle red- not over powering on my fair skin\neye liner: long wearing- have used it in the past",1
"I bought this for the lip balm... if i known the size i would have spent the extra on the full size, the only plus was it's slim size is small enough to fit in my pocket at work. I love the peach scent of peach perfect products. The lipstick shade I enjoy for a casual look.",1
"I bought this foundation after reading/hearing great things about this. I’ve used Dior in the past (Dior AirFlash Foundation) and had no problems with it since it was so light. Granted a foundation is heavier, but this completely messed up my skin. I started noticing little bumps and after a few weeks of use, my skin had red dots, little bumps, and break outs all over the place. I also broke out in a rash on the side of my face and experienced peeling from having the foundation dry my skin out. Never, never using again!!!",0
I bought this from the Biossance site. I found I didnt like the scent and mid day I was able to smell my armpits even after the detox period. A friend told me to try a brand that Sephora doesnt even sell. I dont know if I'm able to say but its works for 24 hours straight and come in a tin. Its Free Me by Fran Ngong. It works and ita only 2 oz but it lasts 2 to 3 months.,3
"I bought this hoping that I could layer it over liquid lipsticks, but I don't think I would really recommend using it like that. This is always in my purse and it is my go-to for when I'm running around on errands or going to a lunch date and want my lips to look fabulous. It applies very smoothly, it feels great on the lips, and it lasts for quite a while. Sometimes the glitters look a little weird after its been on the lips for too long but nothing a quick reapply can fix. Thank god I read the reviews regarding the product not going back into the tube after it has come out which I think should not be the case but overall I really like this product. Can't wait to give the other colors a try!",0
I bought this hoping to cover my under eye circles...which apparently is impossible. It helps a little bit but doesn't actually get the job done. The texture feels nice and I don't have a problem with it creasing.,2
"I bought this immediately when I saw it was released because I love the original Dior Lip Glow. Initially going on, it goes on smoothly with just about no color. After a few minute of sitting in, it becomes very sticky but not goopy. The color develops very faintly or more on the natural side. There is a very subtle warm scent and it has a minor tingle. This honestly feels like a lip gloss, not an oil.",4
"I bought this in a panic when a friend accidentally closed a car door on my arm a few days before I was set to be a bridesmaid, leaving a hideous bruise. This concealed the bruise completely, and with setting powder, it did not budge all night, despite August heat, 80% humidity and rubbing on the side of my dress.",1
"I bought this in a whim because my fave concealer (J*) rarrltnresyocks and I was running low. I've tried finding a replacement that's more readily available, but to no avail. Until now. This is light enough for my fair skin and has a pink undertone as I'm cool complected and have major dark circles. Plus it has a medium but bulldable coverage, so it's grata for light makeup days and more glam days. It blends out sooooo smoothly and looks like my skin, yet perfected. I truly can't say enough good things. I don't usually write reviews, but I can't believe no one is talking about this stuff! You don't even need a lot, a few dots covered my dark circles. The only downside is it does have to be set. It will crease otherwise. So, if you don't like setting your undereyes I wouldn't recommend. Another thing is that I usually use a different concealer to highlight my face (forehead, chin and nose) because I like something more sheer that doesn't really add a lot of coverage, just highlights and smooths. This stuff works for that too!! I need to get another shade for spot concealing. It's been literally YEARS since I only used one concealer for my whole face and I've finally. Found it! I wanna go back to the Mall of America store and hug the girl who suggested this!! Highly recommend!",2
"I bought this in both Dip and Jaws and have been using them for a few days. They've caused my lips to keep peeling-- I don't know if anyone else has experienced this. The glosses don't last long-- the colors fade fast. For the performance, these are overpriced.",2
"I bought this in the mini, the normal size, and the jumbo (which lasts forever). It’s a really great and nourishing oil, but it was too heavy for certain body parts like my face, clogging pores and causing breakouts. It weighed down my hair a bit too much too. I ended up using it a lot on my cuticles and other body parts that weren’t sensitive to breakouts. While this was really great (and a breakthrough product for its time), I’m not sure I’m going to buy another one. There are a number of other nourishing oils out there that are less expensive and do similar things.",2
"I bought this kit over two months ago and I still have some mask and makeup remover left. Great value for your money if you are curious to try this brand. The packaging is cute all all the products have nice mild scents. I actually bought the full size of Dew It All eye cream it's my favorite for day time. Green Clean makeup remover is fantastic I will definitely be buying full size once I'm out. Honey Potion mask is powerful, I use it once per week and will buy full size once it's done. Honey drop was very pleasant to use and has a lovely finish on your skin for daytime but I need something to fight redness so probably won't repurchase. The one I won't repurchase is the night balm just because it's too oily looking and feeling.",1
"I bought this last year.... I did not want to commit to full size products right away since its expensive and wanted to make sure it wasn't just all hype. I am SO happy I bought this!  The bottles are small and I was terrified that this would last me like a few weeks.  first, a little goes a long way. second, I love that they encourage you to mix, so that helps alot too. \nanyway this stuff has transformed my skin!  I recommend to everyone and have bought each and every product full size.",2
I bought this mascara because I wanted a more natural product during pregnancy. The texture is very smooth and overall I’m happy with the performance for a more natural product. \n\nMy biggest critique is that it can be a bit clumpy at times and I definitely have to touch up smudges when I first apply. But it stays on well and has good black color that does not flake as I read other natural products can. Also it washes off well.,0
I bought this mascara on a whim after reading alot of great reviews but ended up returning it. I'm not one to return things because I think it's just too much hassle but I really didn't like this mascara. Immediately clumpy and no matter what I did I couldn't get it to look decent. I didn't even wear it out of the house because it looked so bad. I'll stick to the Climax or Better Than Sex mascara for now.,0
"I bought this moisturizer because it is on the more affordable side of Sephora moisturizers.\nThe first time I used this, I followed my routine as normal (very simple-Caudalie Vinopure Pore Puriyfing Gel cleanser when I shower at night, followed by this moisturizer) and the next morning, I noticed immediate relief of the chronic redness I have on my T-zone and softer skin.\n\nDuring the day, my skin wouldn't become as greasy. I am positive this product helped regulate/calm my sebum production.\n\nUsing once daily on my face and neck, one bottle lasted me around 2 months. It has a light texture, so it may not be enough moisture for those with dry skin, but is a supple amount for those with oily skin. It has not clogged my pores or caused any adverse irritation.\n\nI am very satisfied with this product and will be purchasing another bottle soon!",0
I bought this not expecting much since it swatched pretty sheer... BUT DAMN did this take me by surprise. Probably my favorite lip purchase I have ever made. I top it off lipliner and it just blends and meshes everything together so perfectly. It is the most perfect color ever and out of the other 40 lip products I own.. it’s the ONLY one I have reached for every since I got it. Addicted!!!!,0
"I bought this oil because I wanted a product that could remove all of my makeup in one step instead of using makeup wipes and then needing to cleanse my face. This oil gets the job done with 1-2 pumps and when I go over my face with a cotton pad and toner I don’t see any residual makeup on the pad. I noticed some people complaining about the scent, but it’s subtle and tolerable.",2
"I bought this on a recommendation from a store associate and I am so happy I listened to him. I have tried several differnt eye creams in hopes of brightening my dark circles. This one totally works... it wasn't instant but with consistant use day and night for a couple weeks I definitely saw results.\nI do wish it did more for puffiness, but the brightening part I can't complain about.",4
"I bought this on a whim and wasn't expecting much but this tube is amazing! it's perfect to use for dry skin in the winters. It's thick, smells lovely and is quick to be absorbed. It doesn't smell like pumpkin, more like vanilla almond but I don't mind at all",0
"I bought this on a whim because it caught my attention in the store and I threw it in my basket, I already have several bronzer but this has become my favorite! I don't need blush when I use this, I apply it as bronzer by tapping and then I apply it as blush with a lighter hand and fluffy brush. Looks amazing, it's the perfect color!",3
"I bought this one because of the burgundy color to create different looks, but not that l wanted to wear reddish mascara everyday.\n  I was disappointed because it didn't look as bright.\n  It looked dark brown/black when l was at work (indoors and outdoor), dark brown/ burgundy at a different location, and dark burgundy when l got home. So the color will depend on the light that you are under, but it's definitely not as red as it looks like. \n  I have long eyelashes because l've been using Latisse for a while, so with a good eyelash curler, almost any mascara works just fine for me. I like to overload my lashed with mascara, so l appreciated that a lot of product comes out on the brush. I liked the brusn and the consistency. It didn't smudge even with sunscreen under my eyes, and l could easily remove it with water.\nThe reason why this mascara exceeded my expectations is because, since it still looks dark, l can wear it everyday, and not just once in a while like l originally wanted.",4
"I bought this on sale and have been really pleased with it.  I like that the cap makes it easy to carry and quick to grab out of my bag.  Others have complained about the smaller mouth on the bottle but that was a selling point for me actually, as I'm always spilling water on myself from my larger-mouthed canteens.  I like that it's glass and my water doesn't taste like metal by the time lunch rolls around.  I like that the sleeve is hot pink- the colour makes it much easier to find when I've left it sitting somewhere. I also haven't found it hard to clean. I put soap and water in it and shake it up. Then I take the cap off and wash that and the mouth of the bottle separately.  It takes maybe two minutes.  I'm not sure I would pay full price for this bottle but I'm very happy with the bottle I got for the price I did pay.",1
"I bought this on the recommendation of a salesperson in the store.  I usually use Philosophy, but thought I would give it a try.  It creates an almost wax-like coating on my skin.  Some of it sinks in, but the rest just stays.  I cannot use it if I am going to wear makeup because it pills.  Went back to Philosophy, but will use this up on days when I do not wear makeup.",3
I bought this on the tarte website as a set I am in love the colors are insane the glitter is so much fun !Every time I wear this I get compliments from young and old and everyone in between. If you apply the glitter with your fingers you are good to go there is some fallout but I think it is worth the end result I Highly recommend this pallet,3
I bought this palette coz the colors are earthy but it is not as highly pigmented as the Kat Von D I had. The colors are very light and I had to use a lot of the product which was something I couldn't get used to. Had to return it. Sorry.,1
"I bought this pallette at the Sephora located at Disney World.  When I saw this on display I loved it immediately!  I was able to make several flawless looks with this pallette.  I love sparkles!  If you love beautiful sparkle in your life, this color high quality palette is for you!!!!",2
"I bought this product after a rigorous acne care routine left my skin dry and aching for hydration. \n\nI will say that it worked well at first. The hydration this delivers is unreal. My skin felt quenched, plump, bouncy, and brightened. It delivered everything that it advertised, and the some. The glow was real for a while.\n\nNow I don't remember seeing this as being advertised as being non-comedogenic so that one is probably on me, but it did exacerbate my breakouts. \n\nThe smell of this is not unpleasant but it was definitely strong. So strong that my cat would recoil if I came near him and ran away from me every time I put it on. Heart breaking. I had to stop using it.\n\nI bet this works well for people who don't have sensitive skin, acne-prone skin, or cats that hate the smell of citrus.",4
"I bought this product on a whim, hoping it would be as good as other Fresh products I have tried. Unfortunately I was disappointed with it. It is Not as good as some other advanced lip therapies I have tried from Fresh. My lips didn't feel moisturized, they ended up becoming more dried out and chapped. The mint did leave a cooling feeling on my lips but that's it. [I contacted Fresh directly once; about the Advanced Lip Therapy Serum in the little pots they sell. I was told they were not big sellers here in the US and they stopped making/shipping them here. Unhappy to learn that is an understatement. (FYI for the curious, there were a few Interesting articles out there that talked about those pots?!?)]\nBack to this newest addition from Fresh. It's a no, don't like it, did not help my lips at all. Made them worse matter of fact. So no I will not be buying this product again. Took a chance and came up empty.",3
"I bought this product who has hyper pigmentation after her 2nd pregnancy. She had lost a lot of self confidence because of her dark spots on her cheeks. I bought her this brightening cream alongside the Vitamin C serum and in a month I can tell a difference in the appearance of her dark spots. they have lightened quite a bit and she is loving the product. If you have hyper pigmentation, I advise to use this product and apply for at least a month alongside the Vit C serum from the same line and see the difference, you will not be disappointed.",0
I bought this product with high expectations but it really let me down.  Good thing I only bought the a small tube of it.  This product settles into all fine lines under eyes. I don't recommend if you're looking for a wrinkle concealer.,2
I bought this set for myself for my birthday and I'm so happy that I did. The price is good for what you get and the packaging is a delight. This set would make a perfect holiday gift for a special friend or family member or to treat yourself.,3
"I bought this set for only $10! The eyeliner is holy grail, lasts all day on my oily lids. Mascara is a new favorite, makes  my lashes look very lifted and voluminous. The liquid shadow is stunning, and lasts all day, pretty color too. I HIGHLY recommend you buy it before it sells out!",0
"I bought this set primarily for the essence - I really wanted to try it out before purchasing a full bottle. I actually really like everything in the set EXCEPT the moisturizer. I tried it out for a few days and got these under the skin bumps on my chin. Even after I stopped using the moisturizer they were there, until I went back to using my Juno oil as my moisturizer. Anyway this is a good set to try, as you get generous sizes to try several products before you decide if you want full sized products, and they are great to travel with. If I could make a recommendation, the essence should be in a flip-cap bottle with a small nozzle for easier dispensing, or at least a reducer in the bottle opening (I actually transferred mine into a small travel size flip-cap bottle for this exact reason).",1
I bought this the first day it was released. I had high hopes since I own Trophy Wife which looks amazing on my 400s skin tone. This pink is so beautiful and pale on my skin tone as well as my best friend who has a shade range in the 100s. It will boost any soft glam look with ease.,1
"I bought this thinking my dry skin would not be as flakey and be not as dull and uneven. That didn't happen. my skin broke- out, my pores got clogged AND my fungal acne got worse! however it did leave a nice shine and glow lol. It claims it won't leave an oily feel but it did to my skin.  I gave this an entire month to work but it did more worsening than doing what it claims to do. Lesson learnt, read the fine print ingredients on products that claim they are the 'best'. Especially ingredients that may or may not work for your skin type.",0
"I bought this to brighten my dull skin , immediately noticed after using the product that it's making my lips super dry, discolored and chapped lips. It's fine on my skin but somehow making my lips extremely irritated. I used it for a month to no change in my skin.",1
I bought this to match my Beetroot Bite Beauty lipstick and it's a perfect match! It's a travel size lip liner but it's not a color I use every day so it's perfect for me. It applies smoothly and has good pigmentation. Stayed all day (more than I can say of the lipstick lol) and is the perfect berry toned color!,2
"I bought this to see if this would help with my thinning hair. I'm 44 yrs old and have been experiencing more hair fall in the past 5 years.  I've been using this product for about a month (4-5 days a week) and, I have to say, my hair does look fuller and shinier. Also, most notably, is I have about a third less hair fallout than before. I lose a lot of hair when I shower and I would have to pick up so much hair from the strainer in my bathtub drain. But now, I barely have anything to retrieve. I would give this product more stars if I could! It definitely works for me!",2
"I bought this to try as a cheaper alternative to my Peter Thomas Roth hyaluronic acid serum, and I regret it.  First this product caused pilling of my moisturizers and oils.  My skin felt extremely dry, tight, and irritated when I used this product.  Once I stopped using it, the irritation went away almost immediately.  Plan on going back to my tried and true Peter Thomas Roth serum.",1
"I bought this without reading the reviews, and my experience has been fantastic with this sponge so far. I'm not a fan of BB, I find the texture of them very spongy and it leaves a blotchy finish. This one is smooth, I like the texture. It's relatively dense compared to BB, but still bouncy. it is absolutely huge, I'll agree with that but it works in my favour. I find it blends evenly without absorbing too much and the silicone part was actually great at smoothing out concealer. great sponge!",1
"I bought this yesterday and have used it twice and can hardly get any product to come out. unscrewed the pump and there is no ""straw"" attached. so unless it is full you can't get anything. I will be returning this. For this price I should be able to actually use the product. such a shame because I actually really like the serum. I definitely wouldn't say it's moisturizing.  its actually kinda drying. But it's good for me. BUMMER!!!!",4
I bought three of their products all the same time I was hoping for a product that worked and since it is in exspensive I really wanted it to work it was dissapointing didn't do anything for my skin at all I am in my 50 s and my skin is very tough but it didn't do anything for me,3
"I bought two different colors. SheEO is my absolute favorite! it's a perfect everyday color! The formula is a tad sticky and wears off a little too fast for my liking (even if I'm not eating or drinking anything). I have not tried these with a lip liner, but I feel like using one in the center of your lips would really help the lasting power. I also got Mogul just because it reminds me of my boyfriend (name Miguel, similar? kinda?) it's a very beautiful and bright natural color. I have a tan medium complexion with peach undertones so both these colors look like a nice ""your lip but better"" nude",4
"I bought Uncensored 2.0 and Shamless. Both shades are so flattering on my skin and I can see how these would be universally flattering on all skin tones. The formula is not to thin but not to thick, they are super creamy and moisturizing. My favorite part is that they have a minty feeling to them that you get after your done brushing your teeth but imagine that on your lips. No plumping just a nice menthol feeling that makes you feel like a new woman.",0
"I came across this product while looking for primers that work well with Armani foundation. People were raving about what a great primer this sunscreen was, so I figured I'd try it. I wanted to minimize my pores but was worried that it would break out my skin (I'm prone to congested pores, hoping to grow out of it by the time I'm 60).\n\nI'm very, very impressed with this sunscreen. It doesn't break me out and it plays exceptionally well with the Armani foundation. I use about a pea-size amount. Avoid using too much or it won't absorb and your foundation won't go on as smoothly. It smells great and you can wear it alone or with make-up--it won't leave you white-faced or greasy at all.\n\nSince so many foundations already have SPF, I've always skipped wearing sunscreen. Not to mention most sunscreens I've tried on my face broke me out or made my face far too greasy for make-up. This Tatcha sunscreen is a gamechanger. I highly recommend.",3
"I can never get a foundation to match my skin tone. I'm a light olive with yellow undertones. Like REALLY yellow undertones! I would get matched and it would look ok indoors, but once I was in the sunlight, peachy pink! I add a drop of this to a pump of foundation and it's perfect!",2
I cannot believe how is this product made. I mean this is not a cheap lip liner and still has the worst packaging of everything I have ever tried. When you open it the product just flies directly on the floor :/ and to make things worst it didn't stay on my lips more than a couple of hours. I'm so dissaponted by this :'(,2
I can not believe how much my skin had improved since using this cleanser! i have very skin. almost everything can irritate it. No more breakouts! No more hives! My skin  feels so clean and smooth after every wash. would definitely recommend this product.,4
"I cannot say enough good things about this lipstick! I usually only wear liquid lipstick. my favorite is YSL Tatouage Coutor matte liquid lipstick in #23. I bought the color rose blazer # 89 and wow was blown away. it looks beautiful with my very pale skin, blonde/ beige hair and blue eyes. it smells fantastic and not overwhelming. it heads a shine when first applied which I love! then it dries and becomes a beautiful stain that looks so natural and perfect! definitely would recommend.",4
"I can only give this 3 stars because of a lack of colours. I purchased Fair and swiped against my Bobbi Brown Foundation Stick in Warm Ivory, it was PINK. And the Bobbi Brown isn't even as yellow as my Hourglass Foundation Stick in Bisque or my CoverFX Foundation Stick in G20. So that's unfortunate becuase it really does glide on smooth and buttery like they claim. I did not even bother applying to my face because of how pink it was so am unable to say how well it wears. The feel of it comes close to the Bobbi Brown foundation stick, which is currently my every-day go-to. I would give them a try again if they ever come out with better variety in colours.",2
"I can see why this is one of Givenchy's best selling shade. le rouge formula works amazing and it is pretty consistent based on my experience with 5 other colors in this line. It is super comfortable to wear (coming from someone who has super dry lips), beautiful & luxurious packaging, and  relatively long last lasting for a bullet lipstick ( solid 3 hrs without eating. The color payoff is phenomenal, one swipe is all you need and you are bound to find your perfect shade of nude, red, or berry given the beautiful color selection.",0
"I can't believe how good this is! I've used several color correctors, this is definitely the best and I can tell it will be lasting a very long time because of how little needs to be used! I literally tap my finger on it and then tap it onto my eye area, then darkness instantly disappears, i use it to cover redness on my cheeks too. Doesn't crease or budge all day and  invisible under concealer and makeup. Absolutely love it!",3
"I can't believe it! I just woke up looking on Sephora website here to find a better eye cream because um, I wake up with huge bags under my eyes everyday now which I've never had! I've been using the DE serum under my eyes and this cream and nothing has changed except my eyes look like crap! Yes, hydration but my little lines on my left side are still there and huge, huge puffiness that I have to use eye masks everyday now and that has never been an issue for me. I've seen no improvement except a bit of hydration and both bottles are almost finished. This much Vitamin C should never be used in an eye cream I just read so buyer beware!!! So disappointed!",4
"I can't believe I was so lucky to receive this to test! I definitely see a difference in my skin. The fine lines are blurring out and my skin looks and feels so much softer.  A little goes a LONG way. I use two pumps and that covers my whole face, neck and decolletage. The only reason I could not give five stars is because of the medicinal smell.  It's not bad enough that I would not use the product, but it is definitely noticeable.",3
"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this lotion. It does everything it claims to do, and much more. It calms and soothes my angry skin and leaves it soft and moisturized. I just love how my skin feels when I apply it. Plus, you get great value for the price. The ingredients list is lovely and it doesn't contain stuff that will trigger sensitive skin like so many other toners claiming to be sensitive-skin friendly. I highly recommend it and will keep using it for sure. I am looking forward to trying other products from this brand.",4
"I can't imagine anyone finding this to be a good product.  It is hard, waxy, and sticky, almost as if it is old and dried out.  I tried it on the back of my hand.  It pulled my skin and didn't perceptibly deposit any product.  Huge FAIL.",3
"I can truly see a difference after one use. My 30-something year old skin is super sensitive and psychotic. I have dark spots after having kids and my texture is rough and bumpy. Combination skin. I started using DE products with the protini moisturizer, then purchased pekee and juju bars, then baby facial and now this set. I have seen a drastic improvement in my skin with each addition but this one has been the most dramatic of all. My skin is glowing this morning. No makeup needed. I'm excited to see how it looks with continued use. I am floored by these products. Even several dermatologists have not been able to help me and have always just told me, "" Sorry, it's hormones we can't do much for that"". So happy to see they are wrong! :)",4
I can't say enough about how much I LOVE this powder!  I am a VERY oily girl who typically has to blot several time throughout the day.  I am amazed that this power keeps me from shining like new money before lunchtime!  and it smells so good!  I can smell my face throughout the day and I smile because it's so pleasant.  Not to mention how flawless it makes my skin look!  I wear Fenty 440 foundation and I ordered the Coffee setting powder And it is perfect for my foundation.   Oh and there is a ton of product in the pretty jar with a mirror on the top! so I feel like it will last a while.  this is definitely my new go to powder!,2
I cant say enough good things about this product. I use it once a week as part of my week face pampering routine. Every time I use it my face feels like baby skin and its helping clear our my acne scars as well. One bottle will last for a while.,1
"I can’t say if it “maximized” my lips, but it was very moisturizing and left a nice gloss. It’s a teeny bit sticky compared to past Dior glosses, and does tingle on the lips when it’s on. That wasn’t expected and not always desired, so a star was deducted.",3
"I can't speak on results, the product I used was a sample size that lasted maybe 3-4 days so not long enough for me to see physical results. I also can't speak on the benefit of the roller as there wasnt one on the sample. I will say that the product made my skin feel soft, went on smooth and evenly, didn't roll up when I put my moisturizer on top (a pet peeve of mine) and smelled pleasant. I received the product complimentary for review purposes from Influenster.",2
"I can't tell you enough how much I love this. blends beautifully. sets to a powder soft finish so no powder setting necessary. WONDERFUL for dry skin, doesnt crinkle and crease, WONDERFUL for aging skin. and wears beautifully all day throughout a full days shift in stressful medical environment. I give this a full 10!! totally worth the bucks.",2
"I can't with this product. I used it over silicone based and water based products. It's patchy, it pills, I had no refreshing effect whatsoever. Don't waste your money. \nI got a mini in a set and I'm super glad I didn't buy a full size",2
"I can usually wear night masks and do a great job of cleaning my face first...but for some reason each time I wear this product my acne shows up. I use the recommended one drop of each product and so far I've been putting it on 2 or 3 times a week so my skin doesn't make an overnight zit. When I use it my skin is soft, just wish I didn't get acne.",4
"I careen handle a lot of stinging when it comes to my acne. But the pain has to be worth it. this wasn't.  the sickening orange scent. The intense stinging that lasts well after you toss the pad. And instead of my acne getting better, I have more break outs than ever! Purge time is a thing, but I'm almost done with the tub and the acne is WORSE. I will not repurchase.",1
I chose this as a 100 point reward because I like the small tubes to keep in my pocket while working. My hands get very dry due to frequent washing. This product did little to help with the dryness. It seemed to never really absorb into my skin and I felt I needed to wash my hands more often to remove the greasy residue it left behind. The packaging is very cute and was the reason I tried it in the first place.,3
"I completely Love this cream! I live in a very dry area in Texas so when summer and winter hit my face feels so dry. This has totally changed my skin from the way it feels to the way it looks. It feels so smooth and I see a glow to it as well. I can't wait to use it in winter, I believe that will be a true test. I have tried many moisturizers from Belif, Clinique, and Glow, this one has seemed to be perfect. & a little goes a long way. I also paired it with the Wild Rose cream cleanser and I also recently purchased the mini glow kit with the oil.",4
"I could feel the stinging (plumping) effects, but you don't expect Kylie Jenner lips. I would say the plumping effect is subtle and unnoticed. I didn't find it hydrating at all. The color ""Embrace it"" looks cakey when applied. It also didn't smell very good.",0
"I could not tell a difference in puffiness after just one use, but the eye mask was cool and refreshing. It felt so nice. I would consider purchasing more to determine how it will work on under eye puffiness.",2
I couldn't even notice I had mascara on. Did nothing to lengthen or enhance. It did not flake  or transfer though so that was good. Beware those little tubes that slide off when you wash appear to never dissolve and I couldn't consciously continue to use knowing little balls or tubes of silicone going directly into our waterways.,4
"I couldn't love this product more. The mask stayed on my face and actually was shaped to go into every area of my face and not lift. My skin is super plump and looks great, just in time for my Christmas parties!\n\nOnly take away is there is a mesh sheet to lift off, that honestly seems so pointless and makes it a lot harder to apply to your face.",4
"I'd asked about this concealer when it first came out, having watched a few of my favorite YT/IG'ers rave about it. I was steered away from it by one or two people working in Sephora. They felt it would be too drying, too matte for my more ""mature"" under-eye area, and would accentuate any texture or lines (minimal though they might be). Given the rave reviews I'd seen from the over-40 set, I decided I really wanted to give it a try. I love my NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer (and Soft Matte Concealer) for spot concealing; the shade Vanilla is a perfect match for me, blending in perfectly. However, I've often wished it was a thinner consistency for under my eyes.\nThe GIORGIO ARMANI BEAUTY\nPower Fabric High Coverage Stretchable Concealer is very liquidy, and a little goes a long way. It not only blends out easily and beautifully, but it doesn't crease at all, nor does it emphasize lines or texture. I set it with a light dusting of Viseart Seamless Setting Powder (let it sit a few moments, then brush or buff it away), and it holds up nicely.\nI got the shade 1, which is a bit lighter than I'd normally prefer (I usually prefer to match my concealer to my skin, rather than using a lighter shade to lighten and brighten the under-eye area as some like to). Shade 2 is too yellow, too deep, so 1 is my best option, and it really is totally fine. I wear Luminous Silk in shade 2 for reference.\nSo, if you have more mature skin, and are afraid that this concealer won't work for you, I'd suggest giving it a try.",0
"I'd been looking for YEARS to find a liquid lip that wasn't drying and lasted a long time on my lips. This has become my favorite liquid lip to buy! It's has moisture in it, but dries down completely and doesn't show any texture on my lips (it even looks as if it's plumping them)! One thing: it is not budge proof, but it does apply over itself nicely and lasts a long time if you are out for hours without eating something oily. Would totally recommend you you guys!",0
"I'd been starting to notice those fine lines creeping up now that I'm getting closer to 50. I've been using an eye cream albeit on and off for 20 years now but it just wasn't doing the job. I found a jar of this I had bought in my drawer and seriously the next morning could already see a drastic difference! Now the other product I was using is a brand name and worked great for alot of years but it had a gel like consistency. This is a rich lotion, I notice no smell and I am very sensitive to smells. I will continue to use this as long as it stays the same ☺",3
"Ideal for older eyes, lots of neutral mattes. I've been looking for a pallette with mattes but did not want a ton of dark shades. Wish someone would do all matte pastels. I have plenty of dark shades, plenty of glitters, always looking for matte vanillas,sands,baby aspirin oranges...the industry needs to do a warm to cool matte light shade variation pallette.",3
I debating for a long time getting this palette because of the bright colors. But in the end that is EXACTLY WHY I purchased this palette. The payoff is amazing. Tarte never disappoints. The colors are beautiful and stunning and it even has a slightly sweet smell to it. I love it!,1
I decided after all the amazing things people say about the ND formula that I would take a chance and pick up a palette. These shadows are just fine. Mattes blend well but shimmers are lackluster. Despite trying several different eye primers/concealers they fade pretty quickly on me. To top it off the packaging doesn't reflect the high price tag and the plastic cover inside really feels cheap. Save your $$ and try something else.,4
"I decided to give this a try in spite of the smell, mainly because nothing seems to work for the neck and at least some of the reviews were good. I have now used half the jar twice a day and NOTHING has changed. At least now I know this is a big waste of money. I’d return it but I feel like I have used too much. I won’t ever try anything from this brand again.",2
"I decided to purchase this to give my acne a break, and these hot Louisiana summers are just miserable. it surprisingly medium coverage that covers my redness pretty well. it didn't overly dry my skin out and covered blemishes pretty well.",4
"I decided to splurge and get myself some good brushes, and I wasnt disappointed. These are super soft, pick up the product and blend it really well. I may get another set. Plus the makeup bag is decent size.",0
"I definitely buy more for me and for my friends! save me space during night out,the color payoff is really great,matte but definitely not drying at all when it comes to lip products my lips tends to be really picky! most of them high end  and average brands tends to dry my lips or if theres hydration slides off my lips and be all over my face this one doesn't! this cute little guys stays put for hours! and yes touch ups are easy if you ate oily food. but bad boys did'nt dry my lips. I'm totally impressed!",2
I definitely love the finish of this cushion foundation. It's not too matte and definitely doesn't make my face look oily. It does ozidize though but it happens right away. I had to use a shade lighter than my normal shade so that it matches the rest of my face and neck afterwards lol.,4
"I definitely love the other lip mask more (Agave lip mask). This one is good too, but it's a different texture. This one melts onto ur lips, and it's kind of just like Vaseline but a bit better. It stays on until the next morning but staying power is not as strong as the agave lip mask. Overall, good product, but I'm returning it because the other one is still better.",4
"I definitely recommend this product. As someone who has super dry skin, this actually renewed my skin. Just remember everyone’s skin is different and the product isn’t needed that often! I received this product for free for testing purposes.",0
"I developed acne in my 30s after never having it before and its been difficult to get rid of.  I bought this cleanser after seeing good reviews and it's working well, however, I have to force myself to use it because the sulfur smell is awful.  I'm not sure if I will repurchase this, or go back to the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid wash because I just can't stand the smell.  If you don't have a sensitive nose, I'd definitely recommend it.",2
"I did a good amount of research into this cream's story as it sounded a lot like a marketing ploy, however, it actually is made in a Czech Trappist monastery.  I decided to try a few samples as people with dry skin like mine rave about it but unfortunately, it broke me out.  After looking into the ingredients, I'm not surprised as it contains irritating oils like lemon peel.  In the end, I wouldn't recommend this cream because it contains known irritants and the ingredients don't add up to this price tag, you're paying for monks to make this by hand.  One additional consideration is it's in a jar, which depending on what preservatives are used, can cause bacteria to develop.",2
"I did my research, hyaluronic acid is just completely beneficial for your skin. At first I didn't purchase this because it's expensive.  I tried the Neutrogena one but when you read the ingredient list that one doesn't really have much hyaluronic acid in it at all and it smells cheap. The further down an ingredient is on the list, the least of that ingredient is in the product. With this moisturizer the hyaluronic acid is very high up the list and it's different forms of it. I wasn't about to waste my money so I decided to give the mini bottle a try first and I fell in love. After using it my face feels so hydrated and moisturized. I use it at night and when I wake in the mornings and look in the mirror my skin looks so soft, and juicy as well as plump. My skin looks younger is the best way to explain it. That sold me so I purchased the larger one and shelled out the cash. It took me awhile to spend the money but it was worth it and now I can't go backwards. I'm telling you this is one of the best moisturizers on the market and it is worth every penny. If there is any area where you should splurge it's skincare. I spend more money on skincare than makeup because your skin is important. You don't want to have to need make-up, it's more so something that enhances. Your skin is under that makeup and it needs to be well taken care of. Makeup looks better when your skin care is on point. Purchasing this was worth it and it's been a treat for my skin, it's one of the products where you actually see results.",2
"I did not care for this foundation at all. Felt too wet, color wasn't quite right, and I would have to put on multiple layers to get the right kind of coverage that I need. I received this product free for my review.",4
"I did not care for this mascara. It clumped instantly on initial application and made me look like I had 4 lashes. On a positive note, my 4 lashes looked lengthened and felt soft. Either way, I wouldn't use this again and I also wouldn't recommend anyone buy this when there are so many better and more affordable options.",2
"I did not like it.  I tried all different ways to get this tho work for my skin but every time out was to thick and patchy.  I used a wet sponge,  fingers,  wet foundation brush and nothing worked.  I am returning.",3
I did not like this kit at all.  I returned it.  The items are super tiny and underwhelming.  i ordered this online since it wasn't available at my store.  Had I seen this in person first I would have laughed,2
"I did not like this product for my skin a few years ago, but now as i have aged, it works great. I even make sure i have a small bottle of it for when I travel. I was happy to grab this size on a sale price.",3
"I did not love this - it does give my lips great shine, and its not sticky, but it created a very thick feeling coat on my lips (maybe i put too much on) and my biggest complaint is that the color and shimmer i wanted wasn't there. i wanted it to be way more pink and have way more shimmer/glitter and it just didn't. disappointed because it looks so pretty in the bottle.",0
"i didn't enjoy this product in the slightest. i was swayed by the awesome reviews so maybe I got a lemon? but in my experience of this product, because I wanted to love it so much I kept trying and trying it and yet it still didn't give me the results I wanted. My makeup still sat in the creases and it's consistentcy is like too on the watery side for me. There are also little beads in it at didn't dissolve when applied to my face. Just all around weird. It does have a nice fragrant scent of watermelons but I wasn't going to keep it because it smelled nice. It was a return for me.",0
"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. But the sale price was enticing enough for me to try it. It's really not much to look, just a little gel pad.  But when I got the hang of using it after a few time, I realized it spread nicely and I was using less foundation for the same coverage. I feel that it's more than paid for itself. You should try it!",3
I didnt like it.  felt heavy and dry on my lips.  didnt sparkle as much as I thought it would.  i got 2 colors and didnt care for either.  candy isn't a light pink at all.  its light a mauve lilac color.,2
"i didnt like this mascara ,the mascara is very watery doesnt give my eye lashes volume and lenghth . as it is my eye lasges are small and this mascara doesnt do its job i always have to change to another mascara for volume and lenghth. I wouldn't recommend this mascara to nobody not worth the buy .",4
"I didn't notice any real improvement in my skind after using the entire bottle. I also didn't care for the citrusy scent, especially since I sometimes use it at night. For my money, there are much more effective Vitamin C-based serums on the market. I would not re-purchase this.",2
"I didnt really think too too much about shadow primers I have a lot in my collection. None impressed me much yes they help your make up stay nice for a bit but doesnt have the staying power that they say. \nThat was until I bought this all I have to say is the tube will last a while because all it takes is a bit and you really can tell that you have used something. your shimmers, glitters, sparkly eyeshadow looks exactly like in the pallet!!!!! \n Where has this stuff been all my make up wearing years? I am so In love. This will forever be in my collection from now on. Cant say enough about this product. One of my Favorite purchases.",3
I didn't think I would find a product that would give me such quick results. After a couple nights of using this serum I noticed softer/smoother skin and even some dark spots lightening up. I have dry/normal skin in my 40s and it is one of my favorites. I have a large skincare arsenal and try almost everything that is clean beauty.  highly recommend!,3
I didn't think my ultimate HG red lipstick existed but after years of searching here it is. This particular color is a deep red   mash-up with cool berry. It reads deep red but it whitens teeth and picks up on your pink and blue skin tones. It is matte and lasts forever but it does not dry. it is velvet. The shape of the bullet is ingenious making for perfect application every time. There are so many other shades I want to try but I am going to stockpile a few tubes of Peculiar Pink. I cannot imagine ever buying a different brand and formula of lipstick.,3
"I didn't think this was as good as what I'm using now (Milk Makeup KUSH) but I kept using it, because, well, I had already used it and didn't want to waste it. After using it a few weeks, I'm really happy with the natural look of the color, and light moisturizing. Although the color fades pretty quickly, it still feels like my lips are being taken care of. A little pricey for what it is too.",3
"I didn't want to try this because of both the price and the review scandal. No one would shut up about it, though, so I went in to get a sample. I used it for 4 nights, and from the very first night my horrible, old, pore-riddled, scarred, blotchy red skin looked plump and line-less, and very smooth. I may always need foundation, and this didn't make my skin perfect in half a week, but my foundarion never looked this natural. I DIDN'T PUT GOOD GENES ON IN THE MORNING, just at night as a treatment, but my makeup looks flawless and I finally understand what brightness and radiance look like. I swear I never understood that before. I feel pretty. I feel natural even with makeup on. My makeup looks like actual skin, like an ad for foundation. I can't get over it. I could write about this all night. What if my skin actually does improve over time? What if I can get to the point where I don't need makeup? I will do whatever it takes to raise the money for this, and God I hope they don't raise the price.",3
"I did receive this product for free but I really have come to love this product. In the beginning I wasn’t really sure what it was doing but I’ve noticed it make my skin smoother and softer over the past couple of weeks. It makes your skin so glowy and I love using it before makeup every morning. I would purchase this, I use it daily!",3
"I did receive this product free in return for my honest opinion. Let's start with the dispenser on this product; holy cow. It is amazing....it's literally perfect. You always get the right amount of product, and it never leaves droplets on your face. I will say that it doesn't do well with makeup, so if you were hoping for a setting spray out of this it's not going to be your cup of tea. However it is beautiful as a refresher throughout the day. One other thing to note is that if you have any type of sensitivity to fragrances, this does have some lavender and a few other things. Making it not truly fragrance free. I myself don't have an issue with it though. Overall, I think it's a nice product that feels refreshing on the face. I myself would not purchase it just based off my needs and what I like, but if you are in the market for a nice refreshing mist you may like this. \n\nTip: put it in the fridge and then spray it on your face. It feels so great!",0
I diligently used this every night for a full month and noticed no difference in the rate which my hyperpigmentation from age faded. Dr Dennis gross peel pads were far more effective at that for me. I love Dr Dennis gross products but this one did nothing for me,4
"I'd like to start this review by stating that there are no micro plastic beads in this product. I recently read Caroline Hirons review on this which is a few years old. She basically said the ingredient in question is added to a lot of cleansing balms including hers to add ""slip"" and help the product glide over the skin easily. You can find her explanation in the comments section of her review. Anyways, onto the product. I purchased the mini size just to test out as I have finicky skin. This is a gentle balm that rinses off easily and gets a majority of my makeup off before my second cleanse. I don't notice a scent and I definitely don't detect any micro plastic beads.",1
"I do like REN moisturizers, but this serum does nothing for my 57-year old skin.  This was my second time purchasing it because the reviews are so awesome I thought maybe I missed something and tried again.  I used it today and then put on liquid foundation and it make the foundation pill, just like it would on a sweater. And then my face felt like sandpaper.  Maybe it's the ingredient ""Phenoxyethanol"" which is an alternative to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives.  There is something in there that is very drying to the skin.",3
I do like this product as a CC Cream because of the full coverage. I wanted to get something with an SPF that can be used when hiking but still proved some coverage to my hyper pigment. this product did just that and last a while.,4
"I do love how soft this brush is. I find I like fluffier powder brushes better. This brush was also a bit smaller than I anticipated. I'll keep it and continue to use it, but like it better for bronzer than for the setting powder.",2
"I do love the rose and the cucumber the best. the thermal Hungarian is a total bust for me. the gold mask feels so nice going on, bit that's about it. I do appreciate the pumpkin scent on the pumpkin mask, and I like the way the mud mask doesn't dry or strip my skin",2
"I do not take lashes for granted. For years I was a loyal fan of DiorShow and DiorShow Overcurl. Then, thanks to thyroid medication, my lashes started to fall out once they grew to maybe 1/8"", and I went for a period of several months where I looked like I literally had none, they were so short. Mascara ended up on my lids more than lashes, so I gave up. \n\nOnce I found my holy grail Grande Lash serum and got my lashes to stick around long enough to grow long, I decided to try some new mascaras, and this one from IT was on the market by then. WOW.\n\nFor sheer impact, Superhero Stretch even beats my long-time favorite DiorShow Overcurl, and it doesn't dry out as quickly! \n\nI've tried dozens of high end and department store options and this is one of the best. I wish it came in more shades, as I don't always want this much drama!\n\nThe single caveat... remove the wand sloooooowly from the tube, or you will get a massive glob of product all over the brush and opening of the tube, which you'll have to clean off with a tissue and wastes a ton of product. Going slow let's the brush shed more of the product safely inside the tube.\n\nThat's a design issue, though, not a functional one - and functionally, this is my new go-to. \n\nNote: one advantage Dior has over IT is that Dior on my lashes is softer and more flexible than IT, which is pretty rigid. So while there's no fallout from Superhero for hours to a full day, if you're a chronic 'eye rubber' I could imagine it might be too hard for your lashes while wearing this product.",2
"I do not typically buy new release palettes. In all the palettes I own, this is only the second I have ever purchased less than 6 months after its initial release date. I have never had great luck with high end palettes. Every ABH palette I ever purchased didn't blend well on my lids, the color payoff was disappointing, and creased horribly no matter what primer I used.\n\nBut I saw this palette. The colors. The name. I needed this pallete. And it was my birthday, and my boyfriend and I were right by a Sephora!\n\nI played around with it tonight for the first time. All I really did was just a bit of primer, and went for it.\n\nThe color payoff was simple. Barely had to sweep the brush in to get the color to show true on my lid. It didn't bulk up on my lid, and blended seamlessly. I used a whopping 4 colors (including the glitter) and have never felt more satisfied with something so simply done.\n\nI know everybody's skin reacts differently to different formulas - but considering how mine works with most high end formulas compared to this one, if you're on the fence, I'd say you're more than likely to be highly satisfied.",1
"I don't dislike this. The texture is nice and pigmented enough that it's easy to create a feathered brow without it looking too overdone. BUT this is not a neutral color. It shows as a reddish brown on my skin tone, and I find an ashy greyish brown looks best on my brows. It is also dark for a neutral brown. And you get such a tiny amount... I'm glad I caught it on sale at half off. Will not repurchase or recommend especially full price, but it's not completely bad.",2
"I don't find it gritty. it's not very sparkly. I find it nicely moisturising. more of a tinted balm in my opinion, though the colour lasts a wee bit longer than a balm. I think terracotta nude accurately describes the colour. makes a nice every day lippie. that said I wouldn't spend 50 bucks on a full size.",2
"I don't generally care enough to review products, but I ended up getting this as a sample and bought a whole bottle. This has been essential for me this Winter. The cold and dry New England weather does a number on my aging (37 yrs old) skin and this has been so helpful. I love the smell, not too strong, and it really is comforting. I notice a difference the next day in the redness and dryness. I love it.",2
"I don't get all the good reviews. it seems like it's mostly people who never use moisturizer under their eyes.  I'm sure if the same people used a good moisturizer regularly under their eyes, they would get the same results. this eyecream is basically an expensive moisturizer for your under eyes. it did absolutely nothing for me besides making my eyes itchy. I know three other people who tried it and said the same thing. not worth it",4
"I don't know about 16 hours, but this does have remarkable staying power even with drinking and eating - I can put this on in the morning before going to work and most of it (except for the inner part closest to my mouth) will still be intact by the end of the day. It will also hold up to some drier 'gloss' (such as BITE) being layered on top if my lips feel dry after a few hours. I like the bit of sheen this has even though it's matte, and feel this crayon is easy to apply with its tapered tip. It is very 'slick' so its easy to apply, it just slides over the lips. The plum color is bright without being too garish.",2
"I dont know how I went without this, my skin is usually really oily/sensitive, with dry patches and ever since I've started using this serum, I've noticed a big difference in my face. it's not as oily, not as sensitive and I'm noticing less dry patches/pimples. having a good serum is important, especially since I use retin a(differin), so it was nice to receive this one from my voxbox.",0
"I don't know how these people in the reviews are poking their eyes out or rolling their eyes/under eye wrong, but if they read the directions by pumping until the serum comes out and then roll. The roller ball not only feels nice and cold on your puffy eyes, but rolls nicely without hurting your eyes. Another tip:make sure not to roll the roller ball into the corner of your eyes. It can irritate it. Just like any other skin product or makeup you put in/on your eyes.",2
"I don't know how this product works. I don't really know what it's supposed to do. I do know that that when I stop using it, my skin is dull, drab, breaks out and generally looks blah. Since I've used it consistently, my skin is luminous, plump, pimple free, with reduced hyperpigmentation and acne scarring. AGAIN, I don't know how/what/why, but this stuff will never leave my skin care rotation. My skin is extremely sensitive, acne prone, with fine lines and scars easily. I pat it on clean, dry skin and follow with serum then moisturizer. I'm on my 2nd bottle. Pricey but worth it.",2
"I dont know if i got a defected one but i cant for the life of me get any product out.  i have to shake vigorously in order to get even any product out and it dries out before I even finish half my eye. By the time I get to drawing my wing, nothing comes out...even if I shake vigorously.  nothing! I end up having to use another eyeliner to finish. this is horrible!.",4
"I don't know if I'm using this wrong. But it is not showing up on my olive skin.  I wanted a highlighter that is shimmer free, because I'm 47 and don't care for sparkle or glitter for every day.  I do want to look dewy so I thought this would be perfect. I purchased, based on the reviews. I put this on my cheekbone.  Nothing happens. I could put Vaseline and it would look shinier.  This has no shine. No oomph.  It is just plain not noticeable.  I don't know if I'm applying it incorrectly. I love the concept of it but it just has not worked for me.",1
"I dont know if its just me but this isnt the same as the original beauty blender. the texture isnt the same. its ""rougher""..doesnt have the bounce like the original..i pulled out my old beauty blenders...i have 2 old ones..and those two have the same soft texture  and bounce....THIS one is NOT the same...I mean it does the job, I guess... but its not the beauty blender that Ive come to know and love...I gave it a three star because  for the price, it does come with a small cleanser. Kind of disappointed in this new blender...",1
"I don't know if my head is ridiculously small or maybe I have no concept of how large an eyebrow truly is, but these stencils seem comically large on me. \nI actually regret this purchase - something I have never said that about an Anastasia product.\nI had fantasized how these were going to simply my makeup routine and relieve me of my inquisitive, uneven eyebrows. Instead, I was disappointed by how awkward they were to use, as well as how much I spent on them.",4
I don't know what happened to others that reviewed the mini Palette but mine is great. Whether it was using brushes or my fingers it looks amazing on my lid or swatches on my hand. I had it on for at least 7 hours the other day. So no complaints here. I ordered more for stocking stuffers.,2
"I don't know what it is about this moisturizer, but it's perfect for my skin. I've tried countless moisturizers and this is one of the few that work awesome for me! the serum and Knockout is also great. My skin is never left feeling oily or heavy.",0
"I dont know what kind of voodoo is going on with this product but I'm halfway through the bottle and I'm seeing less scalp! I've always had a part in the front of my hair that was fairly wide, that part has filled in. I cant find it no matter how I part my hair. It's very very good. I do just about 2 full drops and rub into my scalp after a shower. I dont know what some people are saying about making the hair greasy. I have not experienced that. I will stock up on a few bottles. Please dont ever discontinue this product. Its cheap and it works.",2
"I don't know why I am so attracted to this brand. Whether it's the packaging or the aesthetic but I couldn't stop looking at this blush. First of all the shade looks perfect for winter. I thought it would be a nice blush shade that looks like you just came out of the cold and that's exactly what it looks like. I find these blushes are super buildable and they can be quite pigmented. While these blushes are matte they do have some life to them like the slightest sheen, I would consider them a natural finish. But what is very impressive with this blush is it lasted over 12 hours on my cheeks. Not many powder blushes last that long. Overall I'm very impressed with this product and I highly recommend.",1
I dont know why so many bad reviews. This is such a fantastic setting spray. I have very oily skin and this keeps it fresh and perfect for hours and I have never experienced the white specks people are complaining about. I will continue to repurchase,3
"I don't know why the packgers needed to test ""dozens"" of coconut oils to find one to market at this ridiculous price.  For sure there are lots of different kinds/brands of coconut oil, but their differences are mostly in scented (unrefined/virgin)  vs unscented (for cooking), some have more proteins, fiber and water removed than others...but, with that in mind, I have found coconut oil that's just like this at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Vitacost. I don't think I'm allowed to list brand names here, but there are three that are comparable (if not better) than this one. The only difference in the price, and that's definitely not in Kopari's favor.",3

"I don't know why there's 1 negative review for this solid gold greatness in a balm! It's literally the butteriest, smoothest, most hydrating lip balm I've ever used... and I'm a new user, so I can only imagine I'm using the ""new formula"" everyone seems to be disappointed with! I am a lip balm, lip mask, lip treatment, lip scrub, lip therapy connoisseur- so trust me when I tell you... BUY THIS, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!",1
"I don't know why this brand of shea butter is more effective than others I've tried, but for me it is.  The texture is nice because it's a thick balm, not hard and waxy like a lot I have used.  I applied it thickly to my lips that have been peeling for weeks at night, and my knuckles which have cut from being so dry, and both were healed in the morning!",2
"I don't leave reviews lightly. I was very skeptical about these products because of the low cost. These products are amazing! I have extremely sensitive skin and it's so difficult to find products that don't destroy my skin. The Ordinary skincare products are gentle on my skin and leave my skin looking healthy and fresh. Don't let the awesome price fool you, these products are worth so much more than they are priced at.",1
"I don't like the feeling of thick lotions or sunscreens, especially on my face so I was really happy with how smooth this product feels. Unfortunately, it leaves a subtle white cast on my face. This may not be an issue if you use the product as a primer but I wanted to wear this without makeup over it. I really wanted to like this product because I only use mineral sunscreens and this product feels so smooth and it does mattify a little too. I'm a little bummed, maybe I'll just have to use a sheer foundation over it.",4
I dont like the pigmentation，too sheer for my personal preference. And two pressed glitters are not safe for the eye area. Two toppers are OK，however，the yellow one doesnt have a matte base to pair with (no yellow mattes，so the yellow topper cant be layer on itself). The white shimmer(or topper) is super duper sheer，pike there is no pigmentation or shine at all. The deep brown and black are not strong enough. They look dark in the pan，but very sheer on person. I DONT recommend this if you are going for daily use. Fortunatelly，I dont have high hope for this，or I will get super disappointed-this is my first NARS palette. Hope this comment helps a bit to save your money.,4
"I don't like to wear a ton if foundation. But as my skin is still a work in progress, coverage is definitely needed. My issues are hyperpigmentation and an oily t-zone. This foundation did great at talking care of all my needs. The photo below is 1 pump and 10 hours in. My blemishes are well covered and it doesn't feel heavy or cakey. I am a little shiny, but an oil control primer would solve that. It also has SPF 35 so if I ever forget to apply spf by itself I can rest assured that I'm covered. \n\ni am using shade 3N and I received this product for testing purposes.",4
"I don't normally review products, but because of the price tag I felt obligated too. I have sensitive skin, and rosacea and eczema. I get hormonal break out occasionally and sometimes have dry patches. I'm a skincare junkie and have tried TONS of overnight creams and moisturizing masks. I wanted to love this product, but it was very harsh on my skin. I woke up with bright redness after each use. If you have very sensitive skin prone to dryness and redness, look elsewhere.",0
I dont remember I write the review or not. so here I am again… This product is sheer，at the same time，it is sooo pretty and natural! It is the perfect product for everyday basis as well as high working positions! It is not too much not too less，it is right in the middle. However，it doesnt melt into my GA silk foundation so I used a matte foundarion instead and that was beautiful.,4
"I dont see a big difference when I use this product but it does feel lovely going on and hydrate the lips. It's just not as revolutionary as I was hoping. The product dispenses too much for me at a time, so I do feel like I'm wasting a lot of it.",4
"I don't tend to like lip glosses and only occasionally wear lipsticks but this gloss is amazing. It feels just like a balm and the applicator makes putting the gloss on easy. I do wish some of the glitter wasn't blue, but no one would be able to notice unless they were super close to your face. I really hope they release a variety of gloss colors, glitter colors, and ones without glitter!",1
"I dont think I have tried anything decent from FB. All but 2 shades of this messy palette creased on my eyelids, patched up my cheeks and ruined at least 2 tops. I am not surprised in the least to see it on sale.",2
I dont think it's worth the hype. Dont get me wrong it's not a bad mask but it's not super phenomenal.  Dont expects miracles from it. It's a decent mask for once in a while help with  pores and smoothness.  I think its way overpriced for what it is. I do appreciate that it's not difficult to take off like most clay masks.,4
"I don't think I've ever given a 5 star review. this stuff has done wonders for my skin! I suffer from adult acne, and just happened to stumble across this whil in Sephora. I saw on the bottle that it specified that it was for adult acne and was intrigued. I was a little taken aback by the process point, but after only using it for about a week, my skin has cleared up so much! I am not sure what ""limited time offer"" means on the website, but I really hope this item isn't discontinued. it has literally been the only acne product I've tried that doesn't dry out my skin, and that I've actually seen results from.",4
I don't understand all the great reviews. I've been using this consistently for two weeks and don't see any difference at all. I even switched to a cotton round to get more product on instead of the cotton balls because they just absorb the product and don't apply much to my face. I'll keep using it but for now I wouldn't recommend this.,3
"I don't understand how Laneige is marketing this as the same cream it once had under the same name.When I ordered it online which I usual do I thought nothing of the new packaging thought it look sleek however I didn't think to check the ingredidents as I would assume there would be some sort of disclaimer letting us know that the formula has changed but there wasn't. I did a side by side of the old and new cream the formula is completely different. The consistency of the new cream is lighter compare to the old on which was heavier it felt more luxurious. And finally the smell! Usually I am not too sensitive to scents, but this is a pretty strong scent for the new formula compare to the old one. The old one had a more subdued scent that wouldn't bother me when even used at night but the new formula is a lot stronger. I would recommend against using it at night if your sensitive to scents. It is more tolerable during the day.  I really did like the old formula just wish they would let us know about the huge changes somewhere on the page, maybe even having one of those stickers on the image saying new formula would be great! I am going to stick with it for now since I have purchased it and see how my skin reacts to the new formula.",0
"I don’t understand how this balm has four stars. The idea was so cool and so were the pictures/videos posted on her IG, but the product is nothing like that. Too thin to be moisturizing. Too thin to be glossy. Not enough of the shimmer - and when I do build up layers to get it kind of shiny, it’s obnoxious looking and the blue shimmer starts to make the balm look gray on my lips. It’s also such little product! The Tarte lip balm is also pretty small, but super glossy looking and moisturizing. This product is such a waste of money.",0
"I dont understand how this product is so cheap for the quality you get. the powders have a bit of kickback but that's true with all KA powder products. the quality of the powders in the palette are just as good as the singles. my favorite thing though, is the blush. I dont know why but my face eats blush like it is going out of style. no blush lasts on me. except this one. it looks beautiful and stays put. the highlighters are a bit too dark for me to use on my face but they are gorgeous on the eyes. I have no complaints about the contour powders, they live up to the KA reputation. get it get it now!",4
"I dont understand why this palette has so many good reviews. I'm just glad I got thids palette on sale and didn't wast $48 on this garbage. The summers are beautiful. But the mattes literally gave ZERO PIGMENT! I had to scratch off tue top layer to get a swatch. And even then you have to really work hard at it. Nothing comes up on the brush. On top of that, they overfilled the pan. So everytime you'd open the palette there'd be a large chunk of shadow on the casing. I thought ND shadows were supposed to be top notch. But this palette is absolute trash.",0
I don't use rhe powder side but I can see others using it. I prefer a more natural brow look on most days and the slanted tip of the pencil side is awesome for making brow hair strokes. Lasting power is great on my oily skin too.,3
"I don't usually like creme lipsticks or anything this color,  but it looks beautiful! It lasts a long time and is super comfy and creamy.  I barely ever write 5 stars but KVD really did good on this one.",4
"I don't usually wear false lashes often and if I do I prefer natural looking lashes that are closer to my real eyeslashes. Anyways, I'm grateful that I was one of the lucky ones who got to try out these awesome velour lashes. The one I received was secret weapon and I loved how it made my eyes look bigger like a baby doll's. I did have to trim off the ends of the lashes to fit my eyes properly because my eyes aren't that big. These lashes feels and looks well made but I'm not sure if I'm willing to pay so much for just a pair of lashes.\n*I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.*",1
"I don't usually write reviews but this cleanser was such a good purchase that I had to share!\n\nI've been looking for a suitable cleanser for over a year after trying multiple brands (Drunk Elephant, La Mer, Kiehls, Youth to the People, etc) and this gave a nice and refreshing feeling without feeling tight or unfinished (You know when you used a cleanser but doesn't feel completely clean?? Some I've tried above felt that way.) This will work well with all types of skin as I change from dry skin to combination in the summer. Some may not love the faint medicinal smell but I personally love the ginseng as it has many anti aging properties.",0
I don't wear concealer or liquid foundation but I was having one of those I need some brightness in my face moments and tried this from the sample. Main secret with this to look good is you need a TINY amount and I mean TINY. I put 3-4 miniature q-tip size dots below my eyes and blend them in my face with my pinky finger with gentle tapping motion. It's perfection. Put some Halo powder on top and it's amazing. It is so moisturizing that it doesn't settle in your early wrinkles at 38 for me. I love it.,2
"I don't wear makeup every day so this size is perfect for T Zone touch ups when I am wearing make up. For the $ I wish they would have included a mini brush too, it would improve the value. Overall a good product but a tad expensive considering there's no applicator",4
"I do really love this moisturizer/spf combo. the only downside I'd say is that it takes a little time, as most mineral  sunscreens do. it will pill if you don't give everything on your face ample time to absorb and dry. so you have washed your face and applied your toner or essence or both. wait at least 5 minutes. ok now if you use serums tap that right on in ya face, wait at least ten minutes. now time for this product, unfortunately a lot of people rely on the spfs in their moisturizer or foundations only. you need about half a teaspoon over your face and neck to get the full protection of the spf. this product is not just sunscreen so I always use a little bit more. I put it on a few finger tips, rub them together with the fingertips on my other hand and apply, trying to keep to skin friendly motions. this is mineral, you do have to work it a little, the allow it to sit for ten minutes before applying your foundation. this is the only way I have found to 100% ensure myself I will have no white cast, zero pilling, and a truly protected face. if I was a person who needs to get ready in 5 minutes and walk out the door with coffee in hand and half an English muffin still in mouth, I probably wouldn't go for this one. if you have the time though it's really quite fabulous, hydrating and protecting.",1
"I ended up buying the Fenty Glow on a whim.  I haven't been much of a gloss girl since the mid-2000s yet alone a gloss formulated with glitter sort of girl.  I quickly realized that I'm actually not over that stage in my life.  This gloss is creamy, moisturizing and smells absolutely delicious.  Fu$$y is my perfect daily shade, which I had to get the very day that it launched.",1
"I ended up buying the product because I saw someone's review saying it was better than Glossier Boy Brow, which is my favorite. This is nothing like Boy Brow. This formula is very thin and watery which then makes it so it gets on your skin. I cannot see any fibers in the formula. It doesn't help to make my brows look fuller. I ended up returning and re-purchasing my Boy Brow. It also does not keep my brows in place all day.",0
"I enjoyed this primer when my skin was oily. It mattifyed very well. It didn't feel sticky or cakey like some matte primers can. You don't need to use a lot. The price is a bit high for me, but it's a good primer.",2
"I enjoyed this set so much I purchased it twice. Hand cream absorbs quickly. The body cream is thick and delicious. Body spray is a great addition but isnt over powering when layered. The shower gel is my least favourite. I need to use twice the amount as a regular shower gel (Dove) to get the same cleaning satisfaction. \nIt smells so good and in my experience, men love scents like this.",4
"I enjoy the feel and smell of this essence, however I haven’t seen noticeable results yet after using it for two weeks. I will still continue to use it at night as part of my daily routine because I enjoy the texture, almost like a toner. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0
"I enjoy this type of liquid lip. The formula is creamy, opaque, and lasts longer on the lips than a bullet type lipstick. Hippy Shake is a great color for me. light-medium skin with pink undertones, grey hair, and green eyes. I've got plenty of wrinkles and this formula doesn't creep up into the lines around this former smoker's lips. I didn't give it a 5-star rating because of the doe-foot applicator. Well...it's roundish instead of flatish, which I don't likeish.",4
I enjoy using sheet masks because I enjoy relaxing and trying new products.  This masks results are by far better than any other mask I have tried.  My skin just glowed for over two days. It was the effect I was looking for.  I have dry aged skin I swear it made me feel 10 years younger.,3
I enjoy using this serum and it does leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. I'd say the biggest down side is it has kind of a weird smell to it... but that's not such a big deal. I will continue to use it daily.,1
"I expected more from Fenty as a brand.\n1. I love the magnetic/snap packaging. The size is also great especially for traveling.\n2. What I don't love is that most of the colors in all of the palettes are not suitable for dark skin. Yes, I've seen influencers with my complexion use them, but the lengths they have to go through for color payoff is not worth it for the price.",0
"I expected more from this product. It has a tendency to make my skin more sensitive and it leaves my face feeling sticky. Also be sure to diligently avoid the eye area or it will burn your eyelid. I won't say it doesn't work, it does, but I am unsure if it's worth it or if my skin even needs it.",1
I expected so much more from this eye treatment due to the high price. I haven't seen a difference since I started using the product and the packaging is horrible. The bottom of the container broke when pumping the product out. I would not repurchase this or recommend to others.,1
"I experienced all of the things the bad reviews stated BUT once I started using this product WITH the drunk elephant moisturizers like protini  and the whipped cream all the negatives dissapeared and I had great results. I have acne scaring and random adult acne. its helped with fewer to almost no breakouts, diminishing scaring, and closed pores! take the time to invest in Drunk elephant. and use the products as recommended! They.do.work!!!",4
"I experienced this during a make over at the store. My immediate concerns were that I did not have any real skincare routine. Cleanser and drug store moisturizer. I was very oily in my t zone and make up slid off my skin. I am skeptical and not eager to put down lots of money for products that don't deliver on the hype, however I promised myself to try the recommended items. First experience was I liked the scent and how it felt. It is two months later and this is now a staple.\n\nMy store guru told me my skin was not properly hydrated, despite using moisturizers. I wasn't sold on that at first, but  that day, no oil slick. It is now 2 months later and my skin is more hydrated and soft than it has ever been. I no longer have oily t zone and I use less moisturizer. My skin looks much better overall. \n\nFor the frugal, it takes only drops. I got the full sized bottle and I know it will last me 7 months, so it breaks down to less than 10 dollars a month. Plus I use less moisturizer and it has delivered. I know I will add and change my routine as I build it, but this will be a keeper.",4
"I feel like I have finally found a hair supplement that is in a pill form and actually works. I have a chronic medical condition that affects my hair and after taking the entire bottle , I can say I see a difference in the condition and length of my hair. So many supplements are in gummy form,  which not everyone loves, and this one is definitely the best I've used. As with any pill, it takes time and after a month was the turning point in noticable results.",3
"I feel like I owe this product a review since I've been using it for years. It's one of the four products I use daily. I love it, it totally works, it makes my lips fuller and gives them more color.\n\nYou definitely have to warn people before you kiss them though because of the light stinging sensation.",0
"I feel like this really does help take out a lot of my redness even without a corrective green primer that I normally use, smashbox has a great one, I also feel like it doesn't set very heavy on my face like some foundations I use that give this much redness coverage, the only fault is I feel like even with setting spray it does have some transfer issues, but if you are careful not to touch your face too much it shouldn't be bad\nin my picture I have nothing else on but the CC cream and didn't use filters so people can see what it actually looks like on you from different angles of my face",4
"I feel like when it comes to mascara I have tried them all, from drug store brands to the most high end luxury beauty brands as well. This has become my go-to favorite. The formula is wet and goes on evenly. It provides volume without clumping. It doesn't smear during the day and washes off easily when I wash my face. Doesn't even require eye makeup remover. The search is truly over, I am sticking with UD Perversion. Highly recommend.",3
"I fell in love with the colours of this palette but it was the quality of the product itself that warranted this 5-star review. They blend so easily and are a great mixture of mattes, shimmers, etc.. can't express my love for this palette enough!",4
I fell in love with the scent almost a year ago in a sample. Since then I have purchased it 5 times. After a shower I put it on and all day my skin looks & feels 10 years younger. I reapply it a couple times a day just to smell it. I get more compliments when I use this than anything else. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!,3
"I fell in love with this product originally when I received a very small sample of it in my online purchases. \n\nIt makes the under-eyes smooth without drying the skin out and leaves a beautiful finish! The colour is a nice neutral shade on me (doesnt brighten, just sets the concealer underneath).\n\nRecently bought the full-size and could not be happier!",4
"I fell into Kora organics when I was looking for a sleeping mask that had the ""clean at sephora"" stamp. I love love love this mask. It smells so good, has a cooling, hydrating effect when applied and helps me wake up in the morning feeling fresh, with plump skin. I can't wait to try more products from this line",4
"I felt compelled to write a review after seeing so many negative reviews for what I consider one of the best mascaras I've ever owned. Look, not every product is going to work the same for everyone; we all have different needs, desires and tools to achieve the results we want so my advice is to take into consideration all experiences before making a purchase.\n\nMy eyelashes are short and slant downward so my only desire with mascara is a long-lasting curl. This mascara does that. I initially curl my lashes at the mid-way point, then down at the base. I apply 1-2 coats of this product and I don't have to curl my lashes the rest of the day. On occasion, once the formula is dry, I'll do a second base curl for added volume.\n\nThe big issue people are experiencing with this mascara is removal. Personally, I don't have any issues. I'll saturate a cotton pad with Garnier micellar water and let it rest over my eye for a bit; a few gentle wipes takes the majority of it off. BUT ALSO, I take a Q-tip and saturate it in a Dior Hydra Life makeup removal sample I have (only a bit is required). I use it all over my eyelid, brush over the lashes, and wipe along the bottom lash line. I then use the dry end of the Q-tip to wipe off excess makeup. Does it sound like too many steps to remove eye makeup? It should; it's your eyes and you should take extra care to get all that product away from such a sensitive area.",0
"If I can help my skin from the inside out, I'm all for it! I really wanted to try this Mighty Night supplement that Hum gifted me, which is described as a cell renewal vitamin. Sleeping well is something I have a hard time with too and this is suppose to boost sleep quality without melatonin. I took 2 soft gels at bedtime, as recommended, and after taking it for a bit, I have an opinion. For me, this supplement didn't help me fall asleep at night but it did make my sleep quality better! After about 4 days, I started waking up (naturally) about an hour earlier than I usually do and feeling energized! (And I am NOT a morning person!) I didn't change anything about my sleeping habits or activities so the difference is solely attributed to Mighty Night. I am definitely going to continue taking this and repurchasing it since it makes me feel so much better in the mornings! That and the fact that my skin is looking fantastic is a huge plus!",1
"if I could give it 0 stars, I could. But i can't, so Imma give it one star. I picked the color from the one I supposed to pick, but it smells funny, and it's thick (but so are all my other concealers) and it feels warm on my face. EW. I threw it out. won't waste my 14 dollars again.",4
"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. I just love this product. I use a Sephora Collection Mini Pro Airbrush foundation brush. I apply a small amount to my hand, and swipe with my brush then buff it into my face, quarter by quarter.  I got the Light to Medium shade but it's not too pigmented. It makes my face perfectly smooth, doesn't dry it out, doesn't break it out (I have combo/dry skin; in the summer, I lean straight combo). Great great product!",3
"If I could give ten stars I would. I use this lipstick with the CT lip liner and I have to say it it the BEST LIPSTICK I HAVE EVER TRIED. The formula makes it smoothly glide on the lips and instantly makes them softer. It smells amazing and looks super natural. my lips feel so soft and the colour lasts for hours, even if you have a drink and eat (I was trying to avoid ruining the lipstick when I ate but usually it's gone by the time I finish eating and when I used this one it still looked intact by the end of the lunch). I am over the moon happy about it and it was truly worth the price.",4
"if I could give this 0 stars, I would. I was a loyal fan of the other version  for 4 years. it never caused breakouts and it layered well over my liquid foundation. I have oily skin and cystic acne at the age of 41. The other version worked wonders at covering my acne and controlling oil. this version is awful. after 1 day of wearing it my forehead was covered with acne and I never breakout there. my skin was also oilier. I dont know why the formula had to change.  it was perfect before. also the packaging is horrible . there is no place for the sponge. now I am on the hunt for another powder.  I will not buy this again.",2
"If I could give this product more stars, I would. I have been dealing with severe hormonal acne for the past few months and nothing worked. I probably spent over $200 on acne products through Sephora with no results except dry irritated skin. I did some research and found this oil by chance because of some of the ingredients in here are listed as bacteria fighting rebels that also promote skin healing, like evening primrose, rosehip and tamanu oil. There are so many beneficial oils in this thing! So I bit and bought the product. I didnt care for the slightly medicinal scent nor the thickness/tackiness at first. But guys, it works! I got over the scent and the tackiness does absorb into the skin if you give it a minute to process. This oil has absolutely saved my skin. I also do gentle regular cleansings (I use L'Occitane Milk Soap) day and night and I combine a mixture of rose oil and tea tree oil for bedtime. So pleased!",2
I finally bought the Matte Revolution Lipstick in Very Victoria after hearing so many great things about it. The color is beautiful but it felt sticky and I found it to be very drying and not long lasting at all. Very disappointing for a high end lipstick.,3
"I finally decided to try a viseart palette. This palette has beautiful color story, totally my kind of colors. When I first tried it I cannot tell you how pleased I was to have bought this. The colors are rich and easy to blend but do not blend away and they last the whole day. I could not believe they looked exactly same as when I just put them on. I was so impressed I bought 3 more 12 pan palette for my kit",2
"I finally found a lip product that soothes my poor lips! I have tried well over two dozen lip chapstick, lip serums, butters etc with no luck. I finally tried this one and it has healed my poor chapped and cracked lips. I have severe dry mouth due to the meds I have to take. I have permanent cuts on both sides and they are extremely painful. I would get them almost healed and then yawn in the morning and they ripped right back open. But I am having far less problems now and had only two incidents of cut corners in the past 3 weeks! I do use it both day and night because of how moisturizing it is and how it is so very soothing. Also, the jar is only 10g and I'd usually go through that in a week or less. I'm about a month into using it 24/7 and its only half gone! Super thrilled to have found this, especially now that winter is here.",2
I finally got a Charlotte Tilbury make up which I have been wishing for to have. It's also my first time trying their new airbrush finish foundation and so far so good. It looks so natural on my skin and it does look like my real skin tone. It is full coverage but it doesn't look like I am wearing make up at all.,4
"I finally recieved this in the mail today and I am disappointed. It is sheer and applies patchy. 3 layers and I could still see my natural lip color. The photos advertising the product is misleading as well. It's not glossy nor opaque. And, it didn't ""stain"" my lips but rather transferred to my toddler's hands and face with the slightest bump. If it weren't $37 it would be in the trash already. This is going straight back to Sephora.",0
"I find it a bit overpriced for what you get before taking into consideration that only two products are usable. The stick lip balm is too soft of a formula to be placed in that thin of a tube. It ends up being ruined even if you are being extremely cautious not to press too hard or raise the product too high. Not sure what the formula for the lip mask in the squeeze tube is normally like, but I wasn't expecting a hard ointment consistency. I love the nighttime lip therapy in the pot. I suggest just getting the full size of that.",1
"I find it moisturizing & sometimes just use it alone. I thinks it's an alright product, mattifies the skin, but makeup doesn't stay all day long for me. \n\nI recommend you give it a try, its always different on everyone.",2
"I find that this brand is so underrated! They are non-toxic, eco friendly, cruelty free and the packaging is completely recyclable so its a palette you can feel good about owning. I couldn't be happier that I bought this palette. I reach for it a lot more than a lot of my other palettes! The shades are so versatile and the formula is amazing!! The swatches and the promo pictures make it look like they aren't pigmented (I don't know why they look so weird). I had came in with low expectations for this palette since some other clean eyeshadows I've tried haven't been all that pigmented but these blend and go on so nicely! Some of the shades in the middle appear different in the pan than on the eye or swatched (they look purplish but go on kind of like brown shade) that's my only minor complaint. Other than that, this formula and packaging are FLAWLESS. I will be purchasing more palettes from this brand in the future so the answer to should I buy this palette is a yes, you should buy this palette!",1
I find these effectively cleanse my skin even though I don't always pre cleanse or remove my makeup with a wipe. I do wish they were not as rough but that may have something to do with the pressure I'm using.,4
I find this product more gimmicky than anything.  It cleans ok but its a hassle to store between use.  Despite other reviews it does last quite awhile.  I’m just hoping to use it up so I can move onto something else.,2
"I find this to be an average-performing colored lip product. I’ve bought two from this line (fuchsia and berry) and tried on a few more in the store. \n\nPros: The colors are all vibrant and have that pretty “pop”; The product has that signature YSL lip product taste/fragrance that I quite like. The packaging is high quality and the magnetic closure is convenient. \n\nCons: although this claims to be a lip balm, the performance is similar to that of a gloss. My lips feel dry after about 30 minutes, and start to look dry (with small bits of colored flakes) soon after. I do not experience this problem with many cheaper tinted lip oils. In fact, YSL makes a very nice tinted lip oil. Although the packaging is good quality, it is heavy and bulky. I tend to not grab for this product when I carry small purses. \n\nOverall, I expected more from a product at this price range. There are too many cheaper alternatives that perform as well if not better.",1
"I first heard about this on Samantha's channel, and decided to try it on in store. My husband never notices my makeup, but he told me I was GLOWING. Needless to say, I turned right back and got it. It is all my highlighter dreams come true. It is intense without adding texture. It's super glowy without being glittery. I love liquid and cream highlighters and own about 50 of them but this a definite standout. The champage flash shade is almost an identical match to my light skin with olive undertones (NC20 ish). So the base pigment is invisible on the skin and doesn't add darkness to the tops of my cheekbones. Gold flash on me is more white based and definitely more intense. Swatch them in store, you will see what I am talking about.",0
"I first tried it over five years ago and I have tried many powders since, most of the popular ones and to this day this is my favorite. It works great for normal/dry face to slightly reduce shine, it is imperceptible. I reapply it a few times a day as the face gets shiny and it still looks fresh and never cakey, just adds a blur filter and reduces shine. I wish they would come out with better travel versions of this powder.",1
"I first tried the sample as part of my birthday reward, and loved it! It really works! The first time I used it, I put it on my face as directed. After that I got a cotton ball and put my makeup remover on it, swiped it on my face, and there was not a trace if makeup on the cotton ball. This will take off your makeup and cleanse your face just as it claims. I have oily skin, and so to find a product that removes the makeup, and doesn't make me break out, is worth the price! Plus, you don't need much product each time you use it.",3
"I first tried this as a sample and was skeptical. The next day my skin was almost unrecognizable, it looked better than it has in years. I got the full size and haven't regretted it. I'd definitely recommend using a generous amount, as opposed to a thin layer or treating it like a night cream. I've found that using it as directed (generous layer overnight) has given the best results.",1
"I first tried this brand of products almost 10 years ago and I still love them to this day!\nthis is such a great deal since purchasing the 1 oz drying lotion on its own is $23, and the 4 oz spray on its own is $11. I've ordered one for myself and one for a friend for Christmas!",1
"I first tried this mascara in the full size back in June 2019, but ended up returning it because it was dried out and flaked everywhere. I don't know what possessed me to buy it again, but I'm glad I gave it another chance! I think I may have just gotten part of a bad batch with the last one, because this time I tried it and it was amazing! Yes, it is a drier formula, but it seems to work well with my lashes and the oils in my skin. It created volume, emphasized length, and lasted for 10+ hours with no smudging (which I've been experiencing with a lot of mascaras lately) and no flaking. Also, it did not irritate my eyes and was really easy to remove! I am not giving 5 stars just yet because I'll have to see how long this tube lasts me. If you are skeptical because of the mixed reviews, buy the mini and try it out for yourself! Everyone's body chemistry and personal preference is different.",1
"I first used the small version that came in a set with the Lashfood eyelash liquid and really thought it made a difference when I put on mascara.  So, I ordered the full size.  When I used the full size, It seemed like too much product was deposited on my lashes and I think that's because of the plastic applicator.  Normally, I never buy mascara with a plastic applicator for that reason and I have to use an eyelash comb or brush to take off some of the mascara.  This full size seems to deposit more, which I do not like.  My biggest gripe about this is trying to put the applicator back in the tube without bending it.  The applicator has such a weak neck attached to the wand, that it is very difficult to put it back in the tube.  Because of these issues, I intend to return this.",3
"I followed the instructions and left the plastic booties on for 90 minutes, thinking that my 54 year old feet were going to need more than alpha hydroxy and fruit acids to rid them of calluses. Four days later, I got out of the shower and noticed that the bottoms of my feet were peeling like a snake. It continued for a good 10-12 days and i’m shocked by the results. Amazing, soft, nice feet that are summer ready. Worth every one of those 90 minutes! Wish i’d found this sooner!",3
"I found I broke out a lot when I started but decided to wait it out and found it overall did reduce my acne after that first breakout. I'd definitely suggest working your way up to every day slowly if you have dry skin.I have combination skin and a lot of acne scarring and saw positive results in only 2 weeks,the texture of my skin is smoother and brighter and my pores look way smaller.",0
"I found myself really liking this stuff! I had very small dark areas under my eyes and a tiny bit of puffiness. Putting this on, I didn't think too much of it other than the formula felt really silky and absorbed quickly. In the coming days, I was looking at myself in the mirror wondering why my face looked different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. But alas, I found that my eye area was refreshed and made me look like my 14 year old self again (yeah, I know that wasn't that long ago, but still). I wasn't expecting anything anything drastic to happen with this product, but I've felt amazing using it! Maybe it's because I didn't have extreme dark circles and puffiness to begin with? I don't know; but I can say that I'd probably buy it again!\n\nI did receive this product to try, but I'd never recommend anything I didn't love. This is one you've gotta try for yourself to see for yourself!",0
"I found the formula to be rather dry and not volumizing at all. Definitely a more natural than dramatic mascara. However, it did have some clear benefits: 1. Defining, 2. Seemed lengthening on me, 3. No transfer, even though I have very long lashes. I don't think it did much for me overall, as I prefer thicker mascara formulas, but I love that there was no transfer.",2
I found the range of colours in the palette very versatile and fun. They do take some time to blend but as someone who really likes to take their time with eye makeup I didn't feel there was any issues. The brush in the palette was great to pack on the shades. This was the first time for me finding vibrant matte shades that came through on the first swipe.,4
"I found this primer to be very dry and did not apply well.  I don't know if the one I got was old or something, or if that is how it is supposed to be.  I was able to use it only a couple of times before throwing it away.  I should have returned it.",1
"I found this product at Sephora and tested it on my hands. I'm 49 and the skin on my hands is starting to thin and become wrinkly. Almost immediately after applying, my hands looked better. I hated paying the outrageous price for this serum, but it works. I have deep wrinkles across my forehead and this serum plumped them right up. Under my eyes look so much better. I've read several complaints about the packaging but it really isn't that difficult and I think the packaging fits the price tag. Nothing about this product is cheap. I have never paid so much for a skin care product and I hate the idea of doing it again, but I will because it works. Truly a holy grail. The 4 star rating is because of the price.",3
"I found this product by accident a months back while shopping at Sephora in Georgia. I love everything about it. It’s great for those days you just want a light glow on your skin and not all that heavy foundation, powder, etc.",2
"I found this product to be super drying in my not-so-oily zones, and still made me really oily in my T zone. I ended up with contact dermatitis from inflammation in the areas where it dried my skin out after only a couple uses. If you have combination skin I would recommend trying a different one.",1
"I found this to be very condition on the lips and liked the look it gave, but did not notice a difference in lip volume as insinuated. I have since found another product (unfortunately not sold at Sephora) that does both moisturize and plump.",0
"I found this when taking the foundation quiz. I wanted a medium coverage but light weight foundation. The colour finder was a bit off in matching me to my Lancome foundation colour, giving me a darker colour but, it'll work when I'm spray tanned and I'm using it for a trip to a warm climate so i'm not worried about it. I like the overall feel on my skin, it blended well and looked much more natural than my full coverage Lancome product. The price is also a plus!",2
"If purchasing this for a specific look then do it but for an everyday or frequent look I would had difficulty with it. I found that my lips ""tingling"" was more like burning for 20 minutes, followed by looking red and sore at the edges. \nNot something I would buy again.",4
"I frantically bought this kit because of overproduction of acne from a different product. The wash and resurfacing cream helped relief my acne. The face lotion is okay. I am not a big fan of it. As far as the eye cream, I haven't been paying attention if it actually delivers what it is intended to do.",0
"If the quality was MUCH better, this curated color range would be terrific.  The lightest matte (second from left) is good, but the rest palette is pretty much junk.  Payout is chunky, weak or deceiving.  ND does not make cheap palettes well. Period. You can get much, much better quality palettes for $25 - Milani, Colourpop, Essence, Coastal Scents, etc.",2
"If you already own New Nude, or are debating between these two, Mercury Retrograde has cooler-leaning neutrals. They're cool and rosy colors whereas New Nude is warm and rosy. About 1/3 of Mercury Retrograde's shades are similar to New Nude. Mercury Retrograde also has a lot of fall out and glitter migration when compared to New Nude. I would suggest against this palette if you already own New Nude, since Mercury Retrograde gets you the same looks, unless you plan to use the green and purple shades every single time. \n\nThe mattes in Mercury Retrogade are like your typical Huda mattes. Chalky if you overblend, and true to pan if you pack and pat on the shades. Huda mattes do have a tendency to look different on the eyes, usually more vibrant looking. For people who like graphic or high contrast looks, I don't think you would be happy with Vortex. Vortex works well with the color scheme, but it's not deep enough for an intense look. \n\nNebula, the silvery purple shade, applies kind of chunky. The glitters migrate, and I can feel them collect + fall from my top lashes. Mercury, black base with blue-green glitter, is my least favorite shade in this palette. The amount of fallout and lack of pigment in the base is frustrating and annoying. You have to pack it on to get color, but packing it on means fall out as you apply. I have glitter on my cheeks because of those two shades. Supermoon is an overall dud. It doesn't work well as a topper, or on its own. The rest of the shimmers are like your typical Huda shimmers -shiny, vibrant, and smooth application. All the shimmers and glitters applied best with a silicone applicator.\n\nI think New Nude has much better quality, so if you are thinking either-or, I would get New Nude. That's not to say Mercury Retrograde is terrible, I still like it more than ABH and UD, but it's not as quick and as easy to use. I would only recommend Mercury Retrograde if you want cool tones. This isn't a beginner palette either.",0
"If you are concerned about puffiness, and fine lines this is your serum. I have tried multiple brands and have never had results like these. I have used the serum on it's own and have seen a change, but I have seen even better results when I use it in combination with the line smoothing device!",1
"If you are like me who has heavy lashes that are stick straight, this is probably the mascara for you. I'm Filipino, my lashes are somewhat thick and normal medium length but the ends aren't dark enough to make them look as long as they are. I have to use a curler (I do use Shu Uemura) to get my lashes to look attractive in any way shape or form. However all other mascaras I've used are too wet to keep my lashes curled. This mascara works if you have the same problem as me. It's wet enough to coat your lashes so that you can get natural definition while keeping the curl but not too dry that it could still last you a good while without the tube drying out. If you are looking for more definition and volume, you'll have to use another mascara on top of this as I do not recommend more that 3 coats as this mascara is meant to be more for a natural look.",2
"If you can get past the taste (like berry-flavored dirt), it's worth it. I noticed a definite positive change in my skin. I'm very fair, but rather than looking pasty, my skin had a noticeable pearly glow.",1
"If You don't like scent incorporated in your face products this is not for you.\n\nI bought this and tried it on my ( freshly clean) hand as the box directs and boy am I glad I did. First the serum has a strong scent, so strong that you can taste it. So I decided to follow up with the gel and the moisturizer (since parfum isint listed in the ingredients) to see if it would diffuse the smell; nope not at all. it created another scent that is just as strong. I can even smell it off my hand as I type this review. \n\nI am not the type of person to complain about scents because I wear perfume. But when that ingredient is in my face products and sinks into my skin I get headaches. \n\nI will say that I can see this product working for anyone else. But I will say my hand does seem brighter and it feels firm and softer so I wouldn't be suprised that this has results after some time. I just can't use it unfortunately.",4
"if you don't own any of her smaller palettes or even the nude palettes I would say to get this.\n\nThe mattes performed beautifully and the glitter formula in here is definitely different . \n\nHowever, if you own a bunch of her minis and the new nudes (the larger palette) , I would say that you're wasting money on 4 shades because the rest of the palette is dupeable within her own collection.\n\nI own every palettes she's ever launched and this , no doubt, is beautiful but for the sake of saving money , most of it is already in something that she's released.\n\nSome of the shades may be a tone darker or lighter but when applied on the eyes you can't tell the difference .\n\nAs far as the shimmers go I have the list of where it's duped in on my IG if you want to scroll down and look .\n\nAgain, if you don't own any of her minis or her larger palettes , this is a wonderful one to add to your vanity.",4
"If you had a choice would you take 1, 5, 9 peptides. I choose 21! this serum is awesome. what product has 21 peptides that target specific wrinkles. cmon! 2 weeks and I saw a difference. it take time. but patience and commitment will get you results!",2
"if you have a neutral palette or matte palette add this baby and you r done . it is beautiful , one tap and it's watching colors come to life. this palette inspired me to do makeup and I love it so so much.\nbut I would say of you have a good palette but want to add some glam and don't want to waste money on getting all those glitter pens, shimmers then get this .",4
"If you have dry, dull skin, you will LOVE THIS SERUM!  I have tried more serums than I can count and this is in my top 3 of all time for sure.  It has a thicker consistency but blends in like a dream and leaves your skin feeling so hydrated and soft.  Initially I only used it at night but now I use it both day and night and my very dry skin is so much softer.  I haven't had any breakouts and it plays well with moisturizers from other brands.  There's a reason this product has almost 5 stars and over 700 reviews.  You need it.  It's simply amazing!",3
"If you have dry skin, this is the solution for you. I work in an air conditioned office, very cold and very dry, and this is one of the only products that have maintained my skin nourished. I use this as an actual primer, after my spf. After this primer oil I do apply a dewy product, the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter and then I apply a very small amount of light foundation (Wonder Glow by Charlotte Tilbury). This combination has helped me maintain the dewy glow that us dry skin girls crave so much. I do sometimes apply very little amount on the beauty blender and apply it to my under eyes after setting with powder and it looks SO GOOD (learned this trick from a Jaclyn Hill video). Get this, you won't regret it! and the smell is quite pleasant as well.",0
"If you have oily skin, this will be good for you; however, if you have combo-dry skin like me, this isn't hydrating enough.  I'm still using it because it doesn't break me out, but I'm still searching for that perfect moisturizer that hydrates without causing acne.",1
"If you have silver, grey or ashy hair and naturally dark brows, this is perfect. It has ZERO brown or warm tones so you can just shade in where you need it. FYI - it doesn't have to look as dark as the image they use here.",3
if you like dior face and body buy this right now it's so similar very lightweight looks like skin I don't have to set it but if I do it looks beautiful either way. I'm in love it's gorgeous on its own and I love to mix it with my thicker foundation formulas to thin them out and make them more skin like I am so glad this was on sale because it made me try it and I'm writing this review while coming to buy a backup. my other favs for reference are dior skin glow abh luminous Tom ford stick foundation I love a good medium coverage with a skin like finish that lasts and this gives me all the above.,1
"If you like SK-II you can't beat this deal - basically for the cost of the mini, you get the two extra products.  SK-II Essence is a must have product in my house, and I welcomed the opportunity to try the toner.  it was a good toner, and worked well in conjunction with the Essence which leaves my face hydrated and brighter.",2
If you like the glitter and kind of shimmery look go for this because it really is like glitter and oil but looks so beautiful. Also smells amazing! If you're looking for something super metallic like huda beauty's this isn't it.,0
"If you love Clinique moisturizer and mascara then this set is a great value with 3 products for price of one. The moisturizer and eye cream are great for sensitive or combination skin and does not clog pores. Mascara is by far my favorite and reason I purchased this set, it instants brightens up your eyes without looking clunky all day. Must have for work or daily looks.",4
"If you love pineapple, great because the strong scent will linger on your face for a while. It does feel sticky after application. It is not a big deal since I do apply other products onto of it. However, it does nothing that it claims it does. Returning this. 1 star for the cute packaging.",4
"If you're going for a matte look, this will definitely get you there. It also helped cover/hide some larger pores on my nose. It isn't very moisturizing and my cheeks and chin looked crackly later in the day, and that's why I took off one star. Over all, this is a great product!",4
"if you're interested in trying SC lashes, this is a great opportunity.  These lashes are affordable on their own, so having them as a set is great for gifting, stuffing stockings, or just something for yourself because each lash has its own characteristics.  I feel like I go from drama darling to daytime diva with this set.  The lash bands aren't too thick, but not to thin and these lashes can hold up to multiple uses.",2
"if you're like me and cannot be bothered to do make up every morning before starting your day, but want that ""wow"" factor to show you truly care about your appearance, this is the product for you! Every morning, I mix this product with my LaNeige moisturizer. My skin feel luxurious and the compliments I get are endless. See the picture attached :)",0
"If you’re looking for a glowy setting spray and trying to avoid growing a beard from all the castor oil they put in glowy liquid products, this is for you!!! It’s such a good setting spray and gives the perfect glow",0
"If you're looking for a highlighter that is universally flattering and looks wet and metallic then look no further.  Benefit has created a beautiful highlighter with a neutral, champagne tone that has no glitter or sparkle, just metallic awesomeness!  The only downside, and reason I deducted a star is because the price is too high for what it is.  I wish they would have gotten rid of the useless brush that is included and made it closer to $25.",3
if you're looking for a porefessional or smashbox result...dont ...just dont . this stuff does absolutely nothing. I adore urban decay products. this one just didnt cut it. AGAIN- HUGE waste of money. this doesnt work,2
If your trying to choose between this and the sleeping mask...go with the mask. kiss me all day is much thinner than i would have liked but its still a good product. Fyi great feel on the lips..nice to use in the go,2
If you use self Tanner then this is a must. The best mitt I have ever used. It exfoliates and gets rid of your last ran or spots that you were a little heavy in the Tanner... This is the best thing EVER!!!!!!,3
"If you use skincare for it's benefits and not the ""smell"", then this IS for you! This truly leaves your face with a glow while working on improving hyper pigmentation. I've even noticed a difference with fine lines and wrinkles. So if you like perfume on your body and NOT in your skincare, care about quality ingredients and care to give products enough time to actually work and see a difference, then you WILL love and appreciate this face serum!",2
"if you've already used the Exfolikate, then you already know and probably have already bought this set. Good job! this is the second year in a row that I have bought this set. Exfolikate the best exfoliator I have ever used!! and I have suffered with skin issues like eczema my entire life. I don't need to use the sensitive exfoliator this one is perfect. the value for the exfoliator alone is amazing it's like the cleanser and moisturizer live up to the Kate Somerville brand.",2
"If you've never tried this lip sleeping mask, BUY THIS NOW. It will absolutely change your life. I tend toward contact dermatitis on my lips and finding balms and lipsticks that don't aggravate it is always a challenge. I get dry flaky lips in the middle of a swampy summer. Now that I've started using the Laneige lip sleeping mask, my lips are in absolutely lovely shape. I bought this for myself, and I have the full size in my nightstand and the two deluxe sample sizes stashed in my work desk and in the living room. I also have another sample size that I have in my travel toiletry go-bag so it goes with me everywhere. This will really change your lips' life.",2
"If you want to add an essence in your skin, this is the one. I have tried another brand but I saw such great results with Tatcha. A bit pricey but a little is all you need. The bottle will last you several months. Well worth the price.",4
"If you want to try out Glow Recipe products, this is a great set to start with. For reference I have skin that leans toward dry, but normal in some areas.\nI alternate the watermelon & avacado mask each night. The watermelon mask is so hydrating for my skin. It gives me plump supple skin in the morning. To my surprise it wasnt sticky at all. my skin absorbed the product nicely. The avacado mask has gives a beautiful gentle exfoliation. This one also sinks into my skin leaving no residue. I notice an overall evening of my skin tone and the texture is extremely soft. I sometimes will use the avacado mask if I have a special function in the evening. I will leave it on for about 20 minutes, wash off and the do my makeup. My skin looks like I just had a professional facial. \nI will continue to purchase this duo as I feel I see real results. I can see a nice improvement in overall tone, texture and hydration.",2
"if you want to waste your money, buy this. it does absolutely nothing! its super greasy and thick that your skin won't absorb it. i was reading other reviews and almost everyone said they ended up returning it....not good at all",0
"I gave it numerous chances and it just didn't perform.  Initially, my lashes looked great but after a second coat, they started to look spider like.  After a few hours, I got those gross dark smudges in the inner corners of my eyes and I had flakes underneath my eyes. The only pro is it didn't irritate my contacts or eyes.",1
"I gave it only four stars because it makes my eyes water, but other than that this stuff is absolutely amazing.  I purchased it on my own wanting to give it a try and figured since it was Clinique, my senstive eyes should be OK.  Well, other than the fact that it makes my eyes water, the product WORKS for me.  Literally three minutes after I apply the skin beneath my under eye is super hydrated (and I have dry undereyes) and I look rested, awake, and my little lines seem to vanish.  Will purchase again!",2
I gave this 1 star because I had to give it something. This product does absolutely nothing. For the price I thought I'd give it a few tries just incase you needed consistency to see improvement.....nope what a waste of money...,2
I gave this foundation a 3 stars because it's expensive and it kinda make my face greasy around the nose and chin area. No wonder what application tools I use to apply on it still gave me that greasy look. By the way this foundation is very full coverage.,0
"I gave this two stars for the two colors in this kit that are actually somewhat nice. Most of these lip colors are extremely pale, even for a pale person such as myself. I get extremely washed out whenever I use the shades peachy and sand. Truly not cute colors at all. The shade On Mute is sorta nice, but extremely neutral and sorta hard to pair with other looks. I am also a partial towards the shade Beaming because I don't particularly love metallic lips, but if that's your thing, then it's maybe something for you. The only product I think is worth anything is the gloss. it's a super nice shine with just the right amount of shimmer through it. \nThese are all the regular drying Anastasia liquid lip formula, so if you like their formula, make sure you try to swatch in store to see if you truly like the colors. \nI got this sent to me for free through Influenster.",0
"I get a little frustrated with Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks! Don't get me wrong, they are really nice to use but the colors are all a little underwhelming in real life and never look like the colors you see in the swatches. I bought JK Magic and In Love with Olivia and there's not much difference between the two, they both seem peachy nude although Olivia is supposed to be pink. I will keep them both because they are comfortable and don't look horrible on me but I don't think I will be purchasing any more CT lipsticks unless I can actually see and swatch them.",3
I get pimples every now and then around my time of the month. I just place one of these dots on the pimple and the next day it's almost gone. I've even bought these for my 14 year old and she loves them she even had a few friends purchase them.,2
"I get the most complements when I wear this foundation! My skin looks so radiant and smooth! It is a matte foundation, so for my drier skin, I have to use an oil as a primer, but for oily skin, this would work wonders. It is a very liquidy foundation, so very careful when applying it. It's supposed to be a full coverage foundation, but I feel like its more medium.The color stays true and it dries down, so work quickly! Definitely reccomend!",2
"I give this 3 stars because I only like the gel moisturizer. The gel moisturizer works great as a make up base. It makes my textured skin look more smooth. The other products didn't seem to do anything. The face oil gave me white heads, when I woke up in the morning. I wouldn't repurchase because to buy the gel moisturizer alone is way to expensive. Looking for a dupe.",1
"I got a bronzer, blush, and ambient lighting powder. This says ""soft focus"" finish and it looks like I got into a fight with a glitter covered dollar store gift bag and lost. Definitely returning all three. You can see the chunky glitter in the pan and it looks the same on my face.",1
I got a couple of free minis. This makeup remover gets the job done even with waterproof mascara. I wouldn't purchase because I prefer balm based makeup removers. But it's a good simple product if you wear heavy makeup daily and use a lot of product this is cost effective.,1
"I got a Dr Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Acid bottle as a sample with purchase, and I started using it when it arrived last week. it's totally fine, no real complaints. but when I looked to see what reviews it was getting and to read more about it, I was absolutely stunned to see the price tag. seriously, $300 is crazy for hyaluronic acid. not sure what's going on here, but not enough magic in the bottle to justify the price.",3
"I got a foil pack sample and tried that and liked it. So knowing the Huda brand already I purchased the full sized. I absolutely LOVE the scent in her products which seems to be more often than not the biggest turn off for alot of people. But this primer SUCKS. It makes my pores look HUGE and any foundation practically slide off my face. But the worst part is that when I pump it out it is like all oil with this chunky separated white stuff. It's like you have to try to mix it back together to form a resemblance of a cream or primer. Maybe I got a bad one... I tried to mix it in the tube and tried for almost 3 weeks to make it work but it's just crap. I wont return it because I've been using it,  but I certainly wont reccomend it or repurchase it.",1
"I got a little sample tube as a gift, it's a simple jelly like moisturizer with no scent. It did a decent job of moisturizing with no greasy feel. I won't be purchasing just because it didn't do too much for my skin. This would be a great moisturizer for those with teenage skin, very oily or breakout prone skin or those that can't use scented products.",1
"I got a mini in my Sephora Give Me Some Lip Nude kit. Its a sheer pretty peach with a little of gold shimmer, not drying and there is no scent. I ended up loosing mine eventually but I might repurchase once I need to restock my lip products.",1
"I got a minuscule sample of this product and just used it with my serums. There is a perfume smell that I don't like especially in facial products Some reviewer insultingly said it has an old lady smell, since I don't know what  old lady she is referring to, I can't compare it to anything, however this cream doesn't smell pleasant at all.  I don't see the point of this expensive cream, they don't tell you whats in it here so I went to Dior website and found it, you can certainly find cheaper products with Lactic Acid and Citric Acid that doesn't have silicones and bht in it. Will not purchase.  Here are the ingredients per Dior: AQUA (WATER) ● GLYCERIN ● DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE ● BUTYLENE GLYCOL ● SODIUM HYDROXIDE ● ISONONYL ISONONANOATE ● NIACINAMIDE ● LACTIC ACID ● CITRIC ACID ● CETYL ALCOHOL ● STEARYL ALCOHOL ● GLYCOLIC ACID ● GLYCERYL STEARATE ● PEG-100 STEARATE ● PENTYLENE GLYCOL ● POLYACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER-6 ● VINYL DIMETHICONE/METHICONE SILSESQUIOXANE CROSSPOLYMER ● PHENOXYETHANOL ● DIMETHICONE ● MYRISTYL MYRISTATE ● JOJOBA ESTERS ● BEHENYL ALCOHOL ● PARFUM (FRAGRANCE) ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CERA ALBA (BEESWAX) ● STEARIC ACID ● TOCOPHERYL ACETATE ● SODIUM MAGNESIUM SILICATE ● XANTHAN GUM ● SODIUM HYALURONATE ● ADENOSINE ● SODIUM TOCOPHERYL PHOSPHATE ● PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE ● POLYQUATERNIUM-7 ● TOCOPHEROL ● IRIS FLORENTINA ROOT EXTRACT ● BHT ● METHYLSILANOL TRI-PEG-8 GLYCERYL COCOATE",3
"I got a perk facial at my Sephora and she used the cleansing balm on me. I loved it, took a sample home and came back and bought two of these sets. It makes my skin soft and I have noticed a huge difference in my acne skin irregularities. The mask and moisturizer were just an added bonus.",4
"I got a sample of It Cosmetics-  Confidence in a Cream in my November IPSY bag and I HAD to buy it right away! Confidence in a Cream is super concentrated,  so a little goes a long way. This is worth every penny. I put this on before I apply my makeup and it doesn't interfere with my powder or primer. My skin just feels fresh all day. I am 47 years old, so I am starting to get fine lines and this cream plumps them up and with regular use has diminished the appearance of the fine lines. I am going to buy the eye cream next! Buy this, you won't regret it!",3
"I got a sample of this and it's one of the best cleansers I've used! I have oily skin, acne and large pores and this stuff somehow makes my skin less oily, helps it absorb products quicker and doesn't dry it out. My pores seem less noticeable and it completely washes off makeup at the end of the day. My spots are disappearing as well!!! Super excited.",0
I got a sample of this and loved it up until I used setting powder over it... \nIt blended very well and matched my skin tone like a dream. BUT once I put setting powder on it was like I had nothing on at all....my skins problem areas reappeared. I've never had this happen with a concealer. \n\nI was so bummed!!,1
"I got a sample of this from sephora, and LOVED it. I can't speak to the long term benefits because I didn't use it for a lengthy period of time, but I really loved the way my makeup looked on top of it. I got the sample because I heard so many great reviews, and when I tried it on I found that it has a slight yellow tint to it which really helps neutralize my dark circles before I apply makeup. Will definitely be buying this now that I've finished my sample.",0
"I got a sample of this from the manufacturer so thankfully I didn't lose any money over it. I used up the whole trial bottle to see if it would get better over time, and tried using it both morning and night, but alas: same results of filminess and pilling up when I rubbed my skin after application, mimicking the look of dead skin sloughing off. Does not layer well with other products.\nDid not think there could ever be a moisturizer TOO thick for me, but maybe this is it. After looking at the ingredient list I suspect too many polymers.\nThe one upside is the crisp orange scent which can be nice for some.",0
"I got a sample of this in my Birchbox about a year ago, and I haven't been without it since. Yes, it is expensive, but not buying it just is not an option for me. This has absolutely transformed my skin. This has completely faded my melasma and makes my skin absolutely radiant.",4
"I got a sample of this, loved it, and bought the full size. I use this every night before bed (along with some Vitamin E under my eyes for dark circles) and my skin is so soft and hydrated. It helps calm my skin down after dermaplaning, too. I hope they never stop making this, because I will never stop using it.",3
"I got a sample of this, since I use and utterly love the Truth Serum. Day one, my eyes were itchy and tearing up without provocation. Since I dont put my eye creams directly under my eyes, but instead on my orbital bones. I knew the reaction must have been caused by the product formulation and not my application. Not for me.",4
"I got a sample of this some time back, and I was left feeling pretty unimpressed. It is a thin, watery serum that absorbs quickly. Honestly,  I just didn't see that it did anything. No better, and no worse, but I definitely didn't notice a drastic improvement in firmness, fine lines, or texture. This is the second serum from Dr. Jart that I was unimpressed by, although I have enjoyed both moisturizer products I have tried- especially the Ceramadin formula.",2
"I got a sample of this  with an order last week and began using it immediately that night and really love the feel of it, the effect on crepey lids and under eye area. It smooths out most of it. It spreads very easily, you only need a tiny amount for entire eye area and I ordered the full size already. I could see this lasting a very long time as I use it nightly and barely made a dent in the sample jar. Like it better than the FAB one hands down. No tearing, no dryness etc. Its helping my aging eye area.",3
"I got a sample of this with a Sephora order and tried it today. It is not moisturizing for me whatsoever. I gave it three stars because it softened the look of my 11's and a little softening of the creases on either side of my mouth. Time will tell I guess, but for now I'm not spending $70 on the full size.",3
"I got a sample of this with my last order and unfortunately, used it before checking the many, many, many bad reviews. It does smell like popcorn jelly bellies mixed with sickly sweet coconut. The texture is oddly sticky and off-putting. Please do not buy this or you'll end up like me - frantically scrubbing this stench off 20 minutes after applying it.",3
"I got a sample size in an online order and loved it so much I bought the full size. This is the only moisturizer I've found that doesn't immediately get sucked into my dry skin. It feels like it's actually moisturizing. As a plus, it smells divine and the packaging is so gorgeous. I only use it at night, because it feels like it penetrates yet still sits a bit on  the surface of my skin. I will check out other Tatcha products based on this.",4
"I got a sample size of this in the Crush Worthy kit (BTW that is a must get),  Before this Treatment stick I did not like Fresh lip products at all.  This one, however, is a 'Dream"".  It goes on like silk and gives you just the right pinch of color.  I don't notice any particular taste or smell.  I have very, very dry, cracked, patchy lips so I am used to applying product every few hours.  I think people with more normal lips will find this lasts many hours.  I will be buying this on a regular basis (my wallet says ""another one really"").  I have used and loved much more expensive treatment sticks than this so to me this is a price saving.",3
"I got a sample with an order of this and just used it today. First let me say there was barely enough in the packet to cover my face. Now on to the product itself, not a fan, it feels very thick and hard to spread with a brush. I even used that oil packet that came with it. It does not blur pores or anything and feels heavy on the skin. Can't wait to wash it off. I don't need a full coverage foundation and this is thick and feels like its suffocating my skin. Will not purchase.",3
I got a small sample of it. Because of the sample size it was hard to really judge it. What there was of it I thought it was okay. I really did not notice much of a difference. I wish that the sample was just a but bigger.,3
"I got a trial size of these first since I have never used glycolic acid on my face before and wanted to make sure my skin would tolerate it. My skin reacted so well to this! I use it with the face wash and moisturizer and my skin has never looked better. I feel it  helps keep my pores cleared and is starting to work on my uneven skin tone. I have used these nightly for the last 3 weeks and repurchased a full size today. I plan in using these twice a day now to see how that goes. Thanks Sephora for making such good, affordable skin care products.",3
"I got a trial size of this product because my skin was going through a fit so I was desperate to find anything that helped. Spoiler alert: Nothing did, until this. Im fair skinned so typically dark spots from acne linger for a bit, this cleared up my dark spots and my acne until both were hardly noticeable. In 2 uses! this is definitely worth the price.",0
"I got both this and the mini single one, and I prefer the mini one much more. In fact, While I give the larger palette 3 stars, I'll give the mini one 4, maybe even 5 stars (but going to review them both here). \n\nThe large four pan palette is pretty. The shades are nice in color, but they are so chalky, in my opinion. Of the four, Emerald if the most chalky. I also noticed I can't use the same brush for all of them, because they'll break apart. I have to switch between a soft brush and mildly dense. They look nice on my skin tone, so I'm using them as highlighters - but as shadows, I might pass.\n\nI'll also probably depot these and put them in a z-palette.\n\nMoving onto the mini teal one. I love it. It's not the same texture as the larger palette. It's a flakey glitter and feels wet. I like this as an eyeshadow and highlight. Only kinda downside if that it flakes everywhere.\n\nI'm glad I got these both on sale ($10 for the large and 4 for the mini - I think 4 anyways), because full price, I would probably rate each lower then 3 stars for the larger palette and 4-5 stars for the mini single.",0
"I got mini size of this as a promotion. It looks nice on my skin, but after a while, I broke out. And then I realised why. It's got three different silicone in it, making it look like it's doing something to my skin. \n\nIt could be just me tho, I'm generally sensitive to silicones",0
"I got my face done at the store and she used this setting spray. She told me it had a strong alcohol smell, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. Within 5 minutes of spraying this product on my face, I started to get a headache from the smell.  I only wore it for about an hour and half. I couldn't wait to get home and get that smell off my face. it was starting to make me nauseous.  Seriously,  there is no need for a scent this strong for any cosmetic product.",2
I got number 10 and I am in love. I've been waiting forever for this to come back in stock. This palette is beautiful. Colors are gorgeous. And it is Natasha's unique formula. You cannot go wrong with this one. Love it!,2
"I got the Chicago lipstick, and it is a beautiful berry color with a huge color payoff but unfortunately very little staying power. touch your mouth with anything and it's gone. this seems to be okay with this formula in their normal line as well. I'm still going to wear it though because I love the color so much.",1
"I got the Eleganza pair and I love them!!! They are full and glam, yet natural at the same time! I love the thin lash band, too. They remind me of a higher quality, more glam version of the Ardell demi wispies. They clean easily without losing many if any lashes during the process. I definitely recommend these! I have a feeling they will last me for a long time.",0
"I got the Elfing and Selfing duo 2 for 1 bundle and almost hoped I would not like it due to the price for a single tube. Unfortunately, I am addicted. This dreamy balm feels so refreshing and moisturizing. The color is subtle but lovely, perfect for a hint of glowing goodness. I was a bit surprised by the cardboard packaging and some might be disappointed by it, but I personnaly don't care at all, because this stuff is just divine.",4
"I got the light coral ( Carina’s Star ). Beautiful color, truly a soft coral. Being a matte lover, this wears nicely. My other fave is YSL. Charlotte’s is not as creamy as YSL. But, the beautiful tube designs make them special.\nJust got Ruby’y Red- love it too!",3
"I got the mini at checkout as anything with berries tempts me. I have combination skin, used to be dry, and it works. I mean, it's a cleanser after all. I do feel that it's gentle on my skin and doesn't dry me out. It smells nice, does its job, has a really nice jelly texture. Some days it's enough to get my mascara and eyeliner off and doesn't sting. I think I'd buy it again.",0
I got the mini size and im so glad I didnt waste my money on the full size. it goes on super sticky and took forever for the tackiness to go away. I gave up using it and threw it in a drawer. a couple months later I decided to give it another try but it had dried and shrunk into the applicator. into the trash it went.,2
"I got the pink one, i do notice the material or texture is different from all my other beauty blenders. When cleaning my other blenders, this one seem to feel a bit tougher when squeezing? Hard to explain but it would be my least favorite. Ive washed it about 6 or more times and its still washing out dye. For those new that want to try a bb it's not bad for the price with the soap, but as a bb fan i dont grab this one as often. im wondering if they put their flawed ones in their mystery boxes.",0
I got the yellow blender as part of the sweet indulgence set that was available last Christmas.  This particular blender has larger pores and left my foundation looking very splotchy and uneven.  I will stick to the pink blender.,2
I got this along with the Syncro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation. I used my Sigma concealer brush and my fingers to blend it under my eyes. I thought it was a good medium to full coverage and I liked the natural finish of this concealer. I received this in color 301 but 302 is a better color match for me.,0
"I got this as a free deluxe sample with a purchase about 2 months ago. My skin is combination and I live in Wisconsin, so right now it is dry and flaky. I absolutely LOVE how smooth it made my face look and feel. I would give it 5 stars, however the price is what made me sad. I would still purchase though, because it is worth it.",1
"I got this as a free sample and love it so will probably purchase a full size afterwards. it creates great volume, and I even noticed a little more of a curl to my lashes than normal. definitely try it out!",1
I got this as a free sample. it really works at minimizing pores and making skin vidibly clearer softer and smoother. yes it has a strong smell but that's true for most toners. I went to purchase this full size but was stunned to see the little bottle costs $42! that's a lot for toner.,4
"I got this as a free sample when ordering sheet masks and I need more! The product was a light and smooth and perfect for early in the morning, it helped wake up my tired eyes and applied perfectly under foundation and concealer. Definitely ordering a full size ASAP.",1
"I got this as a gift and open opening the C-firma I could not get over the putrid smell, similar to burnt hotdogs like a lot of the other reviewers mentioned. I didnt know this wasnt normal and had already tried my best to overcome it (not worth the torture). Dont bother buying as only the C-hydra is worth it. Also a little goes a long way, but I havent really noticed a change to my skin over the months. Will probably not purchase for myself or anyone else.",1
"I got this as a gift for my sister who has oily skin, and she ADORES it. When she has it on, I swear it looks like there's nothing on her face. It blends out seamlessly and it looks flawless. She also wears it all over her face sometimes as a tinted moisturizer and it looks AMAZING",0
"I got this as a gift to my dad. His dark circles just got worse after his chemo treatments. He loved it. He loved how it smelled, brightened, and hydrated skin around the eyes! And even from my naked eyes, I can see the different just after two weeks!",0
"I got this as a sample and I really like it. I have horribly dry skin/somewhat sensitive. I normally use Korres Greek Yogurt Foaming Cleanser, but I think this is nice to switch up. It left my skin soft and clean feeling without feeling stripped of moisture. would buy again!",4
"I got this as a sample and just finished the bottle and let me tell you I'm walking right back and getting the full size! \n\nI was skeptical because its an oil and my skin is normally oily/combo but I cannot rave about this enough! It reduced my redness, moisturized my skin, made my makeup lay flawlessly and really evened the texture of my skin and gave me an overall glow!!!! \n\nThe best part.... literally instant results. No Joke... like the same/next day I noticed a difference. It got to the point where I didn't feel like I needed makeup. I just put this on and I glowed and my skin looked amazing. The sample size lasted two months because you only need a few drops.",0
I got this as a sample at my store 2 week ago. I use it 3 times and my lips are super soft. My lips have been super dry lately since it's cold. I tried another popular brand that made my lips even dryer. Using this paired with a lip balm improved my lips greatly. I will purchase the next time I go to a store.,4
I got this as a sample because I actually sorta like the bronzer. HARD PASS. it's like putting tinted Vaseline on the face. and feels like it too. I thought it may just be a difficult to work with product and tried it a few times with a few tricks. no.. just no...,2
"I got this as a sample by luck after I saw Manny MUA use it on his Snap.  Then I ordered a 1oz bottle, and I noticed a huge difference in my skin on the 2nd week.  I have used a ton of retinol products, but this one just absorbs better and makes my skin soo smooth.  I've loved every Sunday Riley product I've used except for the tidal cream. But definitely a holy grail product!",1
"I got this as a sample from Influenster. I think this is a bit more matte than anyone’s who’s going for the “your skin, but better,” look. I have combo/oily skin and it definitely grabbed onto some parts of my skin.",1
I got this as a sample with one of my purchases. It has cute packaging but the formula is horrible. It was too wet and made my eyelashes clumpy after the first application.  I'm glad I didnt spend money on this mascara.,0
"I got this as part of a 500 point reward a LONG time ago but only tried it once and put it aside. Recently though, I grabbed for it again thinking it had gone bad after such a long time but thankfully it didn't! Still smelled clean and minty, and after I wore it was SO surprised at how soft it kept my lips. I have very dry lips. I realized too how flattering the barely there colour was and how the subtle sparkle added depth and dimension to my lips. I was so impressed that I ordered a full size even though I think the price is ridiculously high for a gloss, (hence the absence of a star).",1
"I got this as part of a 500 points Beauty Insider reward and I really regret wasting points on it because it doesn't work at all. It's basically just orange scented water and even after baking my foundation, when I spray this on, I just watch all of it melt my makeup off my face. If I accidentally touch my face with with wet hands or dab with a wet tissue, my foundation comes off like I got rained on. Anyway, I guess if you feel like smelling citrusy, maybe you could use this as a fragrance? Because I don't /really/ see any other function to this product.",0
"I got this as part of a sample set and now I want to throw out my brand new bottle of Cetaphil SPF 50. I love the texture of this cream not thick and sticky. I put it on under tinted moisturizers, regular foundations,or alone. It didn't seem to have any scent to me and was moisturizing. Super product for anyone wanting a moisturizer sun protection lotion all in one.",3
"I got this because it was clean product. There are few issues I have with this product. 1st liquid doesnt distribute to the bottom of the tip, which makes difficult to apply. Becareful when you shake to get ink to the tip, it will leak at where the pen and base connect (it got all over my top, fingers, mirror, and my white desk) still didnt get ink to the tip. 2nd its not for reapply/retouch. When you apply first layer and apply second layer, first layer flakes off. 3rd. black is not dark enough at first layer. 4th it smudges really bad. At the end of night I look like panda. 5th some reason when I apply this my eye stings a little and when clean it off eyelids red. Maybe I got faulty one or whatnot. Just really disappointed. Im out of my return date so Im stuck with it.",4
"I got this during the sale, tho I was really hoping they'd come out with a multi color lip mask holiday set. I've had at least 10 tubes of the mask before and love everything about the formula, but it takes me forever to go thru it. I lose it or the tube breaks open at the bottom first, every time. I prefer the minis, none of their packaging has failed me yet. So that part of the set is great.\n\nI hadn't tried the agave mask in the pot or bullet before. The pot and the bullet's formulas are fine - rich and long lasting though the flavor is not nearly as good. The only real problem I have is the bullet. It broke off at the base the first time I used it, like it's designed too thin. The formula is thick, so you need to use some pressure to apply it. This was true in the past of Bite's mini lipstick bullets, too, so they have to know and just don't care.",4
"I got this for my husband for a trip he was taking. He loved it! He uses some of the products from this line in the larger sizes. This we perfect for travel because it had everything in it. Normally the travel items have one or two things you'll use and the rest are filler items. But this one has all the good stuff, especially a mini pro series serum that my husband loves.",1
"I got this for my husband who has extremely oily skin but also dehydrated skin. He has never wanted to put anything on his face out of fear of triggering his cystic acne. He actually likes this moisturizer. It is very gentle, has few ingredients, and dimethicone is low on the list (one of his acne triggers). With a combination of the FAB cleanser and this moisturizer his dehydration has improved without causing any acne.",2
I got this for my nana and she absolutely loves it. It is a nice light coverage foundation that blurs and covers redness. My nana looks 20 years younger with it on. She's gotten so many compliments. It's worth the money.,0
I got this from my husband for Christmas and I have used it every day since I like metallic shades and all of these colors blend extremely well they are not as dark as they appear in the pan .I am really tempted to buy a backup so I never run out I am sure my other pallets are getting jealous,3
"I got this in a FabFitFun box. I already had a moisturizer I was obsessed with, but it's expensive and I wanted to make it last, so I started using this every other day. I think I may officially switch over to this one. \n\nThe scent is a little off-putting and my sensitive skin feels a little bit hot/burning when I apply it after exfoliating. I've learned to love this packaging over an open jar, I want this now! my skin has looked noticably clearer and more dewey, and my pores even look smaller. (disclaimer: I'm also trying other new products right now).",0
"I got this in a mini sample set, skeptical it would crease as so many of its counterparts had; I was WRONG. Wore it all day at work and no creasing, looked beautiful, subtle, perfect, absolutely love it, will definitely purchase again",4
"I got this in a sample Sephora kit and it is nice as a last layer of a nighttime routine. However, it is not something I would purchase full size. Here's why. Laneige water sleep mask is almost visually identical and has the same texture as Belif. And my skin is a helluva lot softer with Laneige. Add in the fact that it's like $10 cheaper?? I'll stick with Laneige. This is a great product, however. There's just more reasonably priced similar products that produce identical, if not better results.",2
i got this in a set and mistook it for a lip gloss. i was happy to discover it was a gloss stick. applied it and fell in love immediately! love that its a balm texture and the color isnt too pigmented. it is a beautiful mlbb. the only thing i dont like about it is the packaging. not only does the packaging mess with my mind but you have to be careful not to twist too much. it does not let you twist it back down.,1
"I got this in a value pack of masks, and this was BY FAR my favorite!! It's the best purifying mask I've ever used and left my skin super soft and smooth. Pair it with a hydrating mask or nice moisturizer afterwards for your best skin day ever!",0
"I got this in a vox box and I tried to make it work for me. the texture is really nice when you touch it, but something about it makes the shades really hard to blend. I tried with different brushes and my fingers because I really wanted to like it. It always ended up looking muddy. I think if you wanted to just wear one shade all over the lid, that would be fine. I did that with the middle shade. But I like to have fun with my make up and to me, this was not a fun palette to play with. I have used other bare minerals products and loved them, just not this one.",1
"I got this in a vox box from influenster and I am pleasantly surprised at how much I love it. I did a three day  wear test day 1 I did not set it and it lasted about 5 hours before it began to fade. for reference i have dry skin. Day 2 and 3 I wore it for 10 + hours each day in this horrible Carolina heat and it did not move!!! I did set it with hourglass hydrating  powder and there was no settling in the lines under my eyes  the color #9 was a great match for my skin tone ( nc 44.5, fenty 370, born this way brulee)and did brighten under the eye but looked natural.I can compare this concealer to too faced born this way but its creamer and does a much better job and a little goes a long way! I am a completion product snob and this is an honest review so...winner winner!",3
"I got this in my first boxy charm and liked it right from the start. its now December and Im just buying a new pot. so dispite the price, its lasting is worth it alone. \ni had very problematic skin and nothing would hydrate without causing another issue, either acne, allergies, making me more dry for some reason? or way too oily. i tried dozens of moisturizers and had finally settled on using clean and clear because it at least didn't react with my skin as much as anything else. \nI was HIGHLY skeptical to try out confidence inna cream. I noticed positive results immediately!! It absorbed into my skin easily and left it feeling dry to the touch, but hydrated. no oily residue, no burning sensation and most importantly, I didn't wake up to a breakout. I used it before bed and morning every day for a week and noticed that my skin just looked better and better every day. \n8bmonths later and I finally have skin I am comfortable goingbout in without makeup.",1
I got this in my Play box and I love it. I've been wearing it as my primer under my makeup and I think it is the best primer I've ever used. I have used a lot of primers! I'm 57 so I need a good base for my base!  My makeup looks very smooth and lines and a few scars I have are minimized!,3
"I got this in one of the promo code offers and so I recieved this in a sample size (.5 oz) \nAt first I was interested In this because the ingredients are amazing and my skin tone works best with AHA exfoliating products. (BHA is way too intense and totally steals all my moisture away) so anyway I was intrigued by the 11% AHA. Along with the other ingredients in this product are good. it's not the type of thing you buy and you can't pronounce them and then when you Google search the ingredient it's something harmful for the skin. So that part is totally approved!!!\n\nSo I put it on my skin with a cotton round as instructed, and the first thing I noticed was how amazing it went onto my skin. No redness or patches or burning!! so that was good. \nwhen I went to pat in the product with my hands IT WAS SUPER TACKY/STICKY! So I went online to see if that is normal and it is, so I'm not scared! I havent yet found the reason to why it feels tacky on the skin but I'm researching that part! \n\nso anyways after I completed the rest of my various skin care routine and products. the end results were great! The stickiness is VERY MINIMAL. So I approve! Also I am not sure if this is a fact...BUT the tackiness makes it seem like the rest of my products I put on my face after the toner help it absorb more into my skin so I get the full benefit of everything I use, starting with this toner!!! \n\nso overall, I APPROVE THIS PRODUCT! Depending on how I feel after this sample is done I MIGHT BUY A FULL SIZE! \nbut I like it so far!",4
I got this in the matte sand color which is oos. It is darker than I expected but I found it is also a great concealer and works well to line the outer rim of lips before lipstick or correcting mistakes when applying lipstick.,3
I got this kit as a gift two years ago (two of the products were different than this year) and it really turned me on to this brand. my favourite masks are the moor mud and the pumpkin. The eye patches are now a weekly fixture. You can't beat the value. They last ages!,1
"I got this kit to try out because of the good reviews  I think I had a allergic reaction. After using both the lip balm and sleeping mask, my lips became extremely dry and chapped. I had to take this back to the store for a refund.",4
"I got this one & girl next door/chic phreak! I love them both so so much. as expected, the left is a more ""normal"" highlight, more for every day wear while the right is the most beautiful highlighter formula I've ever seen. it is technically glittery but somehow so smooth & gorgeous anywhere you put it! it sparkles like a thousand suns kissing your skin & I'm beyond obsessed. I would say that the two duos I got are very similar but GND/CP is a warmer, more peachy pink version of the lighter, cooler toned LD/FC.",4
"I got this only for three things: Amore Pacific, Shiseido and SK-II because they're so expensive. But surprisingly, I fell in love with the other products as well (Especially the Saturday Skin and Glow Recipe masks). I wasn't disappointed at all!\n\nI have been using Asian skincare products for years but rarely the high end ones. The Saturday Skin products really helped smoothen and brighten my skin. SK-II and Amore Pacific never disappoints!\n\nIf you wanna try high end Asian skincare products with a really good deal, this would be your best bet!!",1
I got this on sale and inhave to say it's more worth the sale price than it is full price. even with a good primer you have to layer it quite a bit to get a vibrant color or use a damp brush to achieve a good color saturation. once you get the vibrant color the colors are really pretty though.,4
I got this on sale and still haven't ever spent this much on mascara before. I didn't want to love it as much as I do because it means I'll have to shell out for it again.\nThis mascara is amazing. The coverage from one stroke is more than any other mascara I've tried before. No clumps. Just full on volume and seperation. \nI also chose this for its tubing ability because all other mascara leaves me with raccoon eyes. This stays put until I take it off. Love love love.,4
I got this palette today，I think the quality isnt as bad as lots of reviews stated (but people have different feel of a product right). The mattes are her typical mattes which I DONT think is one of the best mattes formulas. The matallics and shimmers are beautiful and has been improved which are more smooth and creamy than  Desert Dusk palette which has a dry formula and dont stay. However，whether I like the metallics，some of the shimmer toppers are in a chanky way and very hard to pick up with a brush or build up on your eyes. For instance，white shimmer is hard to build，I changed several brushes to made my inner corner light up. The shade Nebula is gorgeous，but it is also hard to make it smooth on the eye. I do hope there are some deeper matte greens matches the shade Haze because you may think Haze is enough to come out with a green eyelook，but its not completely green which is a little disapponting for me personally. And I do wanna state that the DARKEST shade in the pan is a deep plum，but not a black or deep brown (just in case if you are wondering). BTW，lots of people said they think the package is safe. Well，mine is broken when it arrives lol. Sephora may need to be careful with the packing the item，but it is easy to broke anyways since its plastic. not sure I wanna recommend it or not. I think its just personal thing whether you like it or not.,4
"I got this pencil in the light color, which was a decent color for dark blonde/light brown hair and fair skin.  The applicator is very nice, solid and smooth.  But I did not like how hard this pencil was.  There is no softness to it at all.  It is very hard to apply.  Even putting it on my hand I could barely see anything unless I pressed really hard.  Since I do not want to press anything that hard on my delicate skin, this pencil did not work out for me.  I prefer a softer, slightly creamy pencil.",3
"I got this product because I use clean and natural products almost all the time. this seemed like a nice mineral sunscreen option, which also moisturizes. For my dry skin, this seemed like a good option. however, the tint goes chalky and shows up ashy on my medium-tan skin, may be better suited for fair skin tones. also, the product doesn't move around much once applied, and this makes it difficult to apply. I kept it only because I used it a few times, and I like the way it smells, however I would t repurchase, especially given the price.",1
"I got this product complementary of Influenster for their Marc Jacob's vox box, and this concealer stick rocked my world. I've only ever used cream concealers, but this was more convenient, more coverage, and easier to touch up with later in the day. my skin looked smooth and my face looked brighter. such a great concealer!!!",4
I got this today as a gift and I've wanted it for so long. I was scared it would look weird on me but it actually looked so nice! I haven't used it as a layer yet but just straight up wearing it on your lips looks just as pretty.,0
"I got this to use as a sponge for concealer since its so pointed, well this isn't a sponge its like a torpedo. There s no give to this thing. Tried using it to blend foundation around my nose-nope. Useless. Thru it out.",3
"I got this to use while on a 12 hour flight to Hawaii. It absorbed quickly and was easy to reapply. Did not break my skin out and helped to keep it balanced and calm during the long flight.  It also doesn't look like anything on the skin, so you only draw weird looks as you are applying/removing it.",0
"I got this when it was $14 because I never tried a BB before. I was never going pay $20 for a sponge. I got the pink one. The smell after the original rinse (and there was a lot of soap packed into this sponge) was extremely off-putting. Then after the first use I washed it properly. The amount of dye that came out of it was beyond ridiculous. I don't need that on my face. (I wash my sponges between each use.) The second wash = MORE dye. AND it didn't even get all the foundation out of the sponge. It absorbs way more product than my favorite Real Techniques complexion sponge and Eco Tools sponge. They also come completely clean when washing. Plus BB marketing has been super shady and as soon as the VIB sale hit, it was back up to $20. Worst purchase ever. No wonder it took me so long to try one. I knew a $20 sponge would be garbage.",1
"I got this with some points. Well, with a $25 certificate I got with my points so I paid partially for it. I got the lightest shade. It's too dark. I do use it to blend together my bronzer and blush so it's not harsh. It's not a great all over powder either as it has a bit too much shimmer. If they catered to more skin tones I would have been much happier. Buy Hourglass ambient powders instead.",1
"I got this with the fablantis set and I can't wait to buy it full size! I have combo skin, oily tzone that gets dry patches when the weather gets colder. this instantly hydrates and balances my skin, and the fone lines on my forehead are gone! I even tried retinol to erase them but it didn't work. this did the trick! I only use one pump, but I noticed that if I kind of glob it on and don't rub it in, it's kind of tacky. it's not bad enough to make me feel uncomfortable, but I like it because my makeup will stick to it, like a primer almost. I adore this stuff regardless. also helps with redness!",4
"i guess alot of people dislike the smell of this lotion. I have to disagree, I think its so sweet and yummy. it does smell like caramel popcorn. if you're a fan of sweet scents, this is a unique one. as far as the lotion itself and its moisturizing abilities, it's pretty good. a little sticky tho. far too expensive too.",4
I guess I should have understood that this was a highly intense glittery set. Dont get me wrong I love Urban Decay shadows (I buy their palettes more than any other) and I always add a little shimmer but...the primer and even setting spray have shimmer in them. This is fine for nights out on the town but extremely overboard for everyday use. If you want something for special nights this is a great set.,2
"I guess I’ve always used the tan colored bb and never trickled into the colors. After 10  washes, this one is still bleeding pink dye (yuck), and the texture is SO bad. It’s not at all consistent with my previous tan bb’s.",0
"I had a facial at a  L'Occitane's NYC store using their products  of course. The esthetician recommended this product to use under my moisturizer at night only. I went back after 2 months (Yes, she actually remembered me.) After a few minutes of analyzing and touching my face, the esthetician remarked that my skin felt and looked firmer. Recently my mom mentioned that my face was less swollen and I did not lose any weight. I have noticed less puffiness around eye bone area and a little less all around sagginess. I have sensitive skin so it did not irritate it at all. \n\nIf you want to take some tiredness out of your facial skin without visiting a doctor this may be the product to use.",3
"I had a hard time with this one. I couldn't get it to work. Once I figured it out I love this foundation. The trick is to use a sponge (I use Juno & Co), use only half a pump, and set it with the Hourglass setting powder using a wet sponge. It is gorgeous!",2
"I had a sample of agave lip balm and scrub and decided to buy the lip balm  because it was the best I've ever had. This is totally different from the sample. This is shiny unlike the sample, and smells and tastes like chemicals in my throat. First thing I thought was this balm was tampered until I saw the other reviews. Its horrible!! I had to take it right off.  Waste of money!!!",2
"I had a sample of this mascara wish as a gift. I wish I would have tried before I purchased the actual size. The mascara clumps, the associate at the store said it was volumizing and would not clump. I haven’t used and will return.",3
"I had a small panic attack when there was rumor that The Ordinary was closing down last year, because that means I wouldn't be able to get this serum anymore, that's how much I am dependent on it. This product is so affordable yet it cleared my skin up better than any expensive one I have tried before. I am on my second bottle now and have a few more stocked up in my cabinet  (just in case they really close down)",0
"I had been experiencing particularly stubborn and long lasting hormonal breakouts with painful, under the skin zits.  I tried many different topical products, but I wasn’t getting the results I wanted.  I figured I had nothing to lose to at least try this probiotic and I’m glad I did.  I honestly noticed results in the first month, and now on month three I can happily say I haven’t experienced a bad breakout since starting skin heroes.  I get the occasional pimple here and there, but nothing like before.  I definitely recommend!",0
"I had been interested in HUM's original Collagen Pop for ages, adding it to my cart and taking it back out over and over again! The catch for me was the reviews - it seemed that many people didn't love the rosewater flavor. I'm so happy to see that they have changed the flavor! This flavor is true to it's name - a burst of strawberry with a twist of lemon. Absolutely delicious! It does take a little while to dissolve, so add it to water with plenty of time before you are ready to drink it.\n\nIf you're looking at these specifically with the idea of anti-aging results in mind, I'll share with you my experience: I'd personally rank HUM's Glow Sweet Glow (hyaluronic acid supplement) higher for immediate results in MY skin. My suspicion for this is the unpredictable aspect of collagen. Your body uses collagen in a variety of ways, and while you might want to incorporate supplements to plump your face, your body might override your brain and send that collagen to your joints (for example). I suspect I see this moreso than others might as I am an athlete myself. Now this said, since starting collagen supplements, I've experienced less joint pain - which I certainly can't complain about, even if it's less what I ""expected"" from these!\n\nThat said, as is always the case with HUM, these are formulated in line with the science, incorporating C to boost the collagen absorption. I will also add that it is smart to have these as a water-based drink: in the event you are experiencing dehydration, adding these will help alleviate dehydrated skin. Ultimately, your results may vary based on your lifestyle and needs, but the product is made thoughtfully and priced fairly!",1
"I had been looking for an eye cream for a while.  For the past few years, I have used Clinique's All About Eyes Rich but did not see any improvements.  I decided to give this a try since it has had good reviews.  My primary concerns are dark under eye circles and fine lines.  It stings a little when I first put it on, but I can tell that is is hydrating, plus the Vitamin C and collagen helps make me eyes look better and less tired.  A little goes a long way and I use it twice daily (morning and evening).  Sometimes, if I've had a particularly tiring day, I will use it during the afternoons as a ""pick me up"" for my tired eyes.",2
I had been searching for a purple pallet for months when the mauve pallet came to my attention. I use it a minimum of three times a week. Using a good primer helps to keep the colours fresh all day. I bought a second pallet about a month after the first because when you find something you really like...,3
I had did a lot of Research on Sunday Riley Products and first went into Sephora to get a Sample of this Sunday Riley Vitamin C Serum I had enough to test out for 2 Weeks it's a Very Strong Serum and what I Mean by that in Stong in the Glow that it Gives your Face it is Just Amazing and you Only Need a Little. When I Reached out to Sunday Riley they said it would be Best to use this Product with Luna at Night along with C.E.O. Moisturizer I already had the Moisturizer and loved using the Serum with the Moisturizer got a Great Glow with Both of them so when I saw this kit with Luna seeing Sunday Riley suggested using Luna at Night with the Serum I immediately purchased it. Well Unfortunately Luna made my Skin Break Out. I do have Sensitive Skin but the Serum and the C.E.O. Moisturizer did Not Break me out but the Luna did. This Kit Still is Worth the Price even if you Don't use Luna because the Regular Size Serum is Very Expensive. The Serum is Still Worth getting this Set 100%.,3
I had four pimples on my jawline from hormonal acne (that time of the month.) Literally after the first use of this product they went away! The only thing it didn't do is make my skin feel hydrated but that's okay because I put a moisturizer on afterwards anyway. Highly recomend this for anyone with acne. :),4
"I had good results with this pen so I'm back to purchase again. I checked Amazon and found this pen for $54-, crazy! I'll stick with Sephora! I apply twice daily and I try to be consistent. I use a tissue to wipe as much moisture off my teeth as possible and I don't eat or drink for 30 minutes after use.",3
"I had heard about adding collagen for a while now but was reluctant.  I finally decided to try these due to my dull, dry skin.  Within a week I noticed the back of my hands and my forehead was smoother and shinier.  This is no easy feat considering history of chemo and radiation which has left my skin looking horrible. It is not a miracle drug that knocked 20 years off my skin but it is definitely better and worth the price.  I like the fact that is dissolvable and no pills to swallow. The flavor is very good.  I have already bought this again.",2
"I had heard about the incredible ""Better than Sex"" mascara for years and I was excited to finally try it. I have to be honest, I'm disappointed. It doesn't do anything a $10 drugstore mascara won't do, and it flakes!! I haven't had a flaky mascara since the early 2000s, so I was shocked that Too Faced couldn't get their formula together to prevent flakiness. I'm in a high-level job -- I can't just walk around the office with black specks on my face.",1
"I had high expectations based on the numerous 5 star reviews. It is just not what it is hyped up to be. My dark circles are still visible and I haven't noticed much improvement with fine lines after a month of use.\n\nIt is very creamy and absorbs into my skin fast. I pair this with the Mount Lai jade eye massaging tool to decrease puffiness. It is a relaxing nighttime routine, so that is a plus.\n\nMy eyes are sensitive and this does irritate them a bit. I am careful not to apply product too close, but it still seems to bother me.",2
I had high hopes for this but this barely cleans off my brush. It works good for lighter shades but for darker shades it still leaves behind some colour. Of course I know it won't take off all the colour off the brush but this still leaves traces of the last colour used. \nI'll be returning this.,0
"I had high hopes for this one but this was just eh for me. I liked the dewy look but I was only able to achieve that if I put a small amount. If I were to put the normal amount to cover my face, my face looked so oily. The color matched me perfectly that's why I kept this. This one didn't really stand out though.",0
"I had high Hope's for this product. I unfortunately do not love this, but I dont hate it either. I feel that the lip oil sits on my lips and doesn't soak it. It is not sticky and it is a nice gloss, but I dont feel that it moisturizes nearly enough.",1
"I had high hopes for this product; I've used Murad products before with great success (LOVE their salicylic acid cleansers).  Unfortunately, I have come to the end of this bottle and see no difference.  The formula goes on smooth and absorbs well, but for the price point I expected to see better results.  This is my main issue, there is nothing in this formula that recommends itself to me over another eye cream that's less than half the cost.  I do not plan to repurchase.",4
"I had high hopes for this. Tatcha is a luxury brand that promises results. This unfortunately made my skin WAY worse than it already was. I have combination dry skin. I am oily in my T zone and can get dry patches  on my chin and cheeks. These products worsened my skin to the point where it looked like I had dunked my head in a tub of olive oil. My makeup legitimately slid down my face and took off all even with the primer on. The primer itself doesn't do anything special, it didn't help with my make-up application and it certainly didn't help with oil control. The mask is nice but the jar isn't big enough to last to see any actual results. The skin mist just made my oil production worse.  I purchased this set under the impression that oily skin needs moisture and the dewy skin cream seemed to fit the bill but it just made my face a total hot greasy mess. I wish this worked as I have previously tried the water cream as well and that was a fail too. Will be sticking with my tried and true clinique.",0
"I had high hopes. Packaging deserves a 5. Wand a 5. But product 2. Very clumpy, messy, and dried up so fast then poor, all gone. Yes, I tightened the lid and I never pump my mascara. I only got a few uses out of this pricy mascara.",4
"I had my eye on this ever since it released, glad I waited though bc now its on sale! This palette is stunning, I love Becca formulas and this product is no different. I was worried the Caramel bronzer shade would be too light on my medium tan skin tone (NW35 Syracuse in NARS) but w a little building up it's perfect. What I like about this palette is it truly is versatile, you really can do your entire face using only this. Especially if you are into that light, bronzey, glowy monochromatic look, this is for you. For me, the star of the show is the Berry blush shade, it is so pretty on the cheeks, like a winter flush. Both the bronzer and the Berry blush are more of a satin finish, not too shimmery. I swatched Pink Creme next to Becca Rose Gold in store, and they are almost identical, Pink Creme being just a bit more intense highlighty. I've had a couple mini's of Champagne Pop over the years and I've always wanted a full size so this set was perfect! I see myself reaching for this quite often as it's quick and easy to use and it would be perfect for traveling. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1
"I had my eye on this product for a while but I didn't initially purchase it because I wasn't sure how to use it. I should have purchased it sooner, I love this product. Toner's have come a long way and now a lot of them are more hydrating. The reason I love this toner is because it is super hydrating and moisturizing. I alternate between different toners for different reasons, but I use this one mostly in the morning because it looks good under makeup. My skin just looks and feels softer. However sometimes I use it at night because that's when I do my double cleanse. After you wash your face it practically begs for moisture and this product affords me the opportunity to start giving my face moisture immediately. I love the way it feels on my skin. I use it exactly in the place that you would use any toner. So if you're confused on how to use it, it's just that simple. An additional benefit is you can also use it other ways. For example on days I'm exhausted, this helps me to minimize. I'll cut out some of the skin care steps. However that's rare cuz most of the time I do my complete skin care routine. This product has become a holy grail for me, give it a try and you'll understand how beneficial it is to have a toner that can moisturize.",2
I had originally bought this cleanser and it reduced the redness in my cheeks significantly. I accidentally bought the purifying cleansing gel instead of this and the redness came back. My skin looked so different. Not that it was a bad face wash but for my skin it made such a dramatic difference. I switched back to this and my redness is once again going away. I swear by this stuff!,4
"I had originally found this in-store and was able to settle on First Light as my color. (I had tried to use a Fenty highlighter on my lids and that hadn't worked well for me.)  I go old school with this product and use my ring finger to pick up a little bit of color and dab on my lid where my pupil would be if looking forward. Then I sweep my finger lightly to the outside of my lid and then tap the residual between the pupil and inside corner of my eye. After that I tap over the rest of my lid to get just a bit of sparkle. I don't use this as a primer, but as a lid shadow and faint shimmer on the rest of the eye.  The First Light shade on my medium-fair (4Y06) skin makes my eyes pop a bit and helps me to look more well rested. It helps to open up my blue eyes.  I am a contact lens wearer, and have had zero issues with shimmer/glitter fallout. I don't use a lot of product, though my lid has color on it. I would describe my usual look as light makeup. I'm more of a shimmer or satin finish girl and I like the effect this has on my eyes. I follow with a tight line of neutral deep brown kohl liner which builds slightly towards the outside of the eye. I find this product quick and easy to use. I will repurchase when I run low.",2
"I had paid & was abt to leave, when MJ asked if I did bold colors on my lips.  I told him I had an Ox's Blood color I loved. His eyes lit up and he said, would u like to try on this color frm Fenty, it would be perfect on you. I said sure. He put it on & when I saw it, it was GORGEOUS!! MJ is a genius!! I was shocked to see it was a matte, bcuz it wasn't drying like a typical matte. I felt like I HAD to go somewhere after he did my lips so good!!",4
"I had purchased (from Nordstrom, before CT came to Sephora) a Lip Cheat Liner in Pillow Talk. I decided to take advantage of the sale event to pick up Iconic Nude as well.\nI don't always wear a liner, but I like these pencils. They're creamy (the testers from other brands are often dried out when I try to swatch them), and look very much natural lip color with a little oomph.",0
"I had purchased this seeing one vlogger I follow use it in her routine skin care, and gosh she has beautiful porcelain type skin. So I decided to give it a go and at first I really loved it. The texture of the product is like a gel and cream together, so smooth and non-irritating on the skin. Felt like my pores had gone smaller and oil definitely went away. My skin was also softer. Really did a good job cleaning my face and removing make-up. I used it for maybe 4 days to a week continuously every evening until I started noticing tiny bumps on my skin. After a while it got super itchy and slightly painful, so I discontinued using it to see if this was the cause of my outbreak. Lo and behold, my face started clearing up again. I was a tad bit devastated paying a bit for this and not being able to use it, so I decided to use it occasionally, perhaps once or twice a month and this method has shown no problems for me.",1
"I had read great things about this and was very excited to try it for the second time. The first time I tried this was last year, but I was having terrible breakouts in general. I have somewhat gotten my skin under control and thought maybe I would try out again this year. Well, same thing this year - I wound up with multiple small bumps under my skin on my chin within days of trying this product. Even after I discontinued use, the bumps stuck around until I went back to using Juno Oil as my moisturizer.  oh well, I guess this just isn't for me!",1
I had  received a sample of this and tried it after a bad reaction to IT face wash and my skin cleared up in about half an hour with most of the redness and in 2 days my skin was clear of any irritation. yesterday my daughter used it after having an allergic reaction and in a few hours and then overnight her skin cleared up completely. I will never be without this as it does wonders!!!!,3
"I had seen some mixed reviews from different influencers but I generally love all ABH products and I recently received the Luminous foundation so I was very excited to try this powder with it since obviously it should perform best when paired with this foundation. I typically don't stray far from my Laura Mercier powder but this powder is now what i'm reaching for. If you are looking for a powder that will keep you matte ALL day this is for you. I don't even have to do any heavy baking, i like to use a brush and press my powder in and I did not need a single touch up. In photos my skin looks so smooth and beautiful. I think this powder would be great for my oily girls and I can't wait to use this in the summer when it's very hot because it literally locks your face down. I tend to sweat and it still held everything up. This powder definitely EXCEEDED my expectations, I honestly didn't think I would find something as great as Laura Mercier's powder but ABH literally NEVER disappoints!",1
"I had started to get quite bad acne on my chin that would flare up and cause my skin to become dry and irritated. I originally started using this as a light cover up for my acne when going to the gym so that I wasn't wearing a full face of foundation, and not only did it not clog my pores, but it seriously helped to even out my skin's texture. I've now gotten to the point where I typically only wear this to spot conceal any redness and even out my skin tone, but it blends so well I don't even feel like I've got anything on. It's completely helped to calm down my skin, and never makes any problem areas that I do have to cover up look dry or patchy.",3
I had such high hopes for this although it covers little. and it has  I wouldn't say it's complete coverage. without a second coat . And disappears fast \nand regardless it takes up on the skin and it settles into the little chicken skin wrinkles that are under the eyes for women over 50 at least for this woman I'll just use this on the side of my nose for my capillary veins or something cuz it is pretty good and it does last long.\nI just wish it had that Flex technology that a lot of other skin covering products do!,3
"I had such high hopes for this foundation, after the makeup dried it it completely highlighted my fine lines and wrinkles by sinking into them.  I am sure this makeup works great for younger skin.  If you are above 40, avoid it.",2
"I had the worst time finding a color match for my skin. I was interested in many other brands that I was told were good for my skin type but none of them came in a light color with the undertone I was looking for. I have a hard time finding foundation with a pale pink undertone that doesnt make me look too yellow or unnaturally tanned. \n     I was previously using KVD neutral 42 and was looking for a foundation in the same color but that doesnt enhance the dry areas around my nose or cause me to break out and after trying countless brands on my hand I came across this foundation which I had never considered previously.\n     It's perfect if you have dry skin and dont usually break out and just want a coverage to make your red areas disappear. This is by no means a full coverage foundation (more like a medium) but I don't usually like full coverage anyway (That's why I wanted to switch from KVD). \n     With very little product I can make my skin look color-coded even and it doesnt even look like i have foundation on.\n     The only thing I'd suggest is using a setting spray after applying sense it tends to come off easily in for blow your nose, cry, etc. but using setting spray is an easy thing to do!\n     I highly recommend this for anyone with dry skin who wants to even their skin tone and doesnt need a full coverage.\n     If you have oily skin and tend to break out I wouldn't recommend this because like I said, it comes off easily.\n     I hope this was helpful to anyone looking to try this foundation because to me, personally it's worth every penny and I'll definitely be purchasing this product regularly!",0
"I had to change my moisturizer due my oily skin getting worse now that I'm in my 30s. This product is great and not greasy at all, helps my skin stay hydrated while my make up stays on for my 10 hour work days. My foundation does start to move at hour 8, but it is far superior than other foundations I've used.\nVery little scent. Love the packaging. Will purchase again.",4
"I had to come and review this product because it has replaced my current night time moisturizers. Let me start off by saying I got this in a boxy charm subscription box. You never know if you're going to like the products you receive. Well let me tell you, this product has become a staple for me. I reach for it every night and I have to force myself to occasionally rotate. The main reason I like it is because it leaves me feeling incredibly hydrated and moisturized but it doesn't overdo it. I have to be careful because I have oily skin. I use this moisturizer strictly at night because it's one of those strong ones. It's been helping with my hyperpigmentation and I cannot stress enough how hydrated I feel after using this. It contains some very good ingredients like hyaluronic acid and niacinimide. The only thing I dont enjoy about this is the scent because it kind of smells medical. I like for my products to smell really good because I'm very into aromatherapy. However because this moisturizer works so good it doesn't even matter to me and I find myself reaching for it over other moisturizers. I keep it in my mini beauty fridge as to add to the wonderful experience of using it.",2
"I had wanted this pallet since forever. When i finally got my hands on it and used it a few times i noticed it made my eyes water like crazy! Which obviously ruins the whole entire look. I absolutely love the color scheme however some definitely have no color payoff and have massive fallout (Rose pink, sultry, dusty rose, and noir).",4
I hated this primer its clings to everything i dont want to like texture or dry patches so much that little pores looked 3D. also the glitter particles looked so horrible on my skin. i couldn't even continue with my routine.  I took this product off and used my normal primer,4
I hate how much I love it. I use it every day and I've had it for 5+ years. it looks brand new. the bristles are still aligned and theres no fall out at all. the brush distributes color beautifully. it is a good weight. the handle is long and large enough that it feels ergonomic in the hands. I'm so mad that my boyfriend paid 60 dollars for a single brush. I'm even madder that this is literally the best blush brush I've ever used and that it is worth every penny.,4
"I hate that I bought this. It works so well. Literally everything I want in a foundation. Medium natural buildable coverage.  Skin like  (satin) finish,  not matte and not dewy. But definitely can be manipulated to either using primer or specific setting sprays. Easy to blend. Large amount of product. Does not irritate my combo (sometimes sensitive) skin. Lasts all day for me, with or without a setting spray. Looks natural and not at all, mask like. Very easy to use and travel with since it's a stick. Only flaw is the price, its crazy. I would recommend to anyone who wants to try a stick foundation that I would say is phenomenal with the coin to spend because for most of us (me included) its a investment. 1 stick will last a long time,  you don't need a ton for each application like many liquid foundations.",4
"I hate to buy things that aren't readily available nearby -- the only Sephora that isn't an hour away is the one in JCPenney's, and they don't carry this brand.  But onto the balm -- it IS a balm; so it's the last part of a bedtime skincare drill.  It's amazing.  I have sensitive, dry skin to start with, but being ""of a certain age"" -- sadly, your skin changes with the onset of the big M -- it's even drier.  This balm gives my skin an overnight drink.  I'm prone to rosacea and can't speak yet to whether it calms flare-ups.  Thankfully, with a constellation of a 2-step cleanse, a emollient toner, some Ordinary products -- my pH barrier is healthier than it's been in years.  This is a great addition as we head into winter.",3
"I have 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8 and I love them so far. They are really cohesive so it's easy to create a look with them on the go.\nThe formula is good, I haven't had any trouble with them. There is a bit of fallout, but nothing too bad.",4
"I have 12 of these (so far), in two of the XL palettes. I purchased the M, ME, and I formula and every one of them are fabulous. I was feeling palette fatigue with the insane amount of releases we've seen in 2019 and decided I'd build my own ""perfect"" palette instead. So glad I did. These shadows in the six pan palettes are so travel friendly and sleek, and you can put together the perfect mix of shades so you're not wasting space lugging along bulky palettes half full of shades you won't be using. Highly recommend.",2
"I have 4 of these creamy, long wearing, crease resistant, blendable “crayons” - I am in loooove with them! I’m 56 and get up at 4:15am for work. My makeup routine has to be easy and look good and last all day with no time to do any “checking”. Any product that can deliver all this perfection is worth the price.",3
"I have AA almond-colored skin, I guess. Regardless, this doesn't really show up on me so it is not effective as contour. I just swirl the brush around to get all the colors and use as regular face powder and it's ok for that. Probably would be better for lighter complexions.",3
I have about an avg of 50 brushes....but consider myself an amateur.  this is the best eyebrow brush ever!!!  I use this with the kat von d brow pot and it gives such precise application it feels like I have been with children's brushes and now want to explore more undiscovered gems.  I also use this with eyeliner application and eyeshadow as an eyeliner bc it's so precise.  it's perfect!,4
"I have a closet full of skincare products that don't do what they promise. Not this mask.  I love it.  It probably isn't for sensitive skinned people because it is very strong. Its consistency is thick with tiny exfoliants in it (supposedly all natural). You apply it, massage in for 60 seconds (probably to loosen up the surface layer of dead skin) and then leave on for another 10 minutes.  When you rinse it off, you are left with soft, smooth skin.  Makeup applies like a dream. There is a holiday bundle of Summer Friday skincare at Sephora which includes this. I plan to get that, and am looking forward to trying some of their other products.",4
"I have acne prone (cystic, whiteheads, comedones mostly) super oily skin that is pretty easily irritated. I also get keratosis pelaris on my neck. SO frustrating. I've had 2 Clarisonic mia's (like them), the original Luna Mini (awful), and now the Mini 2 (YES). \n\nThe Clarisonic leaves you feeling hardcore scrubbed and afterward just a tad raw.. Mini 2 feels more like a massage, my skin is sooooft, and thoroughly clean, even though it doesn't feel like you might imagine 'deep cleaning' to feel like. I can use it daily and it's gentle enough to use on active breakouts. It does feel sorta awkward in the hand at first but you get used to it quickly.\n\nI never bought any of these full price, always in conjunction with a sale or coupons. I think full price for any of these is quite high, but more justifiable with the Foreo's because it's a one time purchase and lasts for several years according to a lot of reviewers.\n\nClarisonic's: liked em (hence purchasing a second later on) but only use it every few days because using it more made my skin feel sandy, sort of overworked if that makes sense. Also feels terrible when you have active breakouts and cysts, learned I had to be careful not to rip very tender skin off sometimes. I like it for body more than face I think.\n\nLUNA MINI ORIGINAL: Bought it to replace my first Clarisonic when it was dying. I liked the idea of no brush replacing, more hygienic, battery life. Felt nice. Didn't clean at all. Literally had to wash my face a second time with my hands again after using it. Ended up getting my second Clarisonic instead.\n\n\nLUNA MINI 2: They got it so right with this one. The silicone nubs are longer than on the mini 1, makes a big difference. The intensity adjustment on this is subtle but noticeable. On Foreo's website they say the motor is 2x the power of the mini 1. Having now used both I agree with that. Everything that made me not like the original was fixed with this one.",4
"I have acne prone, sensitive and combination skin. Most cleansers dry me out to much or break me out even one's made for acne pron skin break me out. This product Ive been using every night befor bed and think its wonderfull. my face feels super clean and soft afterwards but not super dry. I gave this 4 stars because I agree with the other reviews on the packaging. Dont squeeze the bottle to much or you'll get to much product out. A little goes a long way!",0
"I have acne prone sensitive skin and I got a sample of this moisturizer together with their new Lotus night cream and a soy face wash. I was really excited to try this moisturizer and I've already give a 4th time try and my skin gets irritated and itchy everytime I'd use it! I love the smell and the great ingredients, but it also leaves my face shiny.",4
I have acne prone skin and some acne scaring and redness. This product has helped significantly decrease the pigmentation  I apply it at night and it keeps my skin hydrated and feeling great. some people might be hesitant to use an oil on acne prone skin but dont hesitate with this. I just use a couple drops every night and it has  not caused any breakouts,4
"I have acne scars and large pores that loves to get clogged by anything and everything. As such, I'm very wary of trying out new products and very picky of what I put on my skin.\nThis is my first foray into Vitamin C. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and I'm very conflicted about this product.\nI've read and watched amazing reviews about this so I must admit that I started out with high expectations.\nOn the plus side, my skin tolerates this well and it didn't break me out or clog my pores.\nWhilst I haven't had adverse reactions to it, I don't see any favorable results either. If anything I feel like this is, quite ironically, Making the texture of my skin more pronounced than it really is.\nSo yeah, mixed feelings.",4
I have actually been using this primer for several years now. I NEVER do my brows without it! I actually use it BEFORE I apply my brows products. It helps my products to stay on and helps to tame my hairs. In my opinion you can use it both BEFORE AND AFTER for the perfect brows! This is a MUST HAVE for perfect brows!,3
"I have a deep love for Skinfix and have not been disappointed as of yet.  Their dark spot remover has helped even out my skintone and has minimized the look of the one dark spot I have on my face.  The cream is more like a moisturizer and less like a treatment or serum, but I'm okay with that.  My skin still feels amazing after use.",2
"I have a few Tatcha products already--Essence and the water cream, so I wanted a travel kit.  The other products were disappointing to me, so I am going to return the set because it was expensive and I won't use most of the products.  I also have Amore Pacific powder cleanser, but unlike Tacha's because it foams up, but sometimes the powder it can make me cough.  The nighttime moisturizer is too heavy for my skin type, and I do not like the cleansing oil.  I do like a number of Tatcha's products, but not this set.",3
"I have a hard time finding eye creams that i like. Because they tend to leave this weird feeling film on my face and i just rarely find an undereye product that leaves me satisfied. BUT this stuff was a pleasant surprise! It's very thick, almost like a balm, but it rubs in and absorbs really fast, which i like. It doesnt set on the skin for a long time, my skin just drinks it up and i can continue to my next step. its very convenient like that. and it leaves noticeable results, so thats good. Hey Sephora Play, can you send me some CBD skincare this summer, please?!?!",1
I have a little bit of the original left and it saved my lips today. (Since the formula change I try to use it sparingly.)  I put the original formula on twice and my chapped lips are 95% better. I reached in my drawer to put in on again and grabbed this new one by mistake and yuck. Please bring back the original. If it's not broken why fix it?,2
"I have allergic reactions to anything with butylene and propylene glycol in it.  This moisturizer doesn't have those ingredients in it, as to where most face moisterizers do. It is the only face cream that I've used that hasn't caused irritation and/or breakouts.  I've been using it for a little over a month and my face feels and looks so much better.",4
"I have all the colors except ethereal (too light) I use Dim over my entire face after foundation to bring down any shine, I use Diffused on any reddish areas, I do not use to set concealer as I am older and I don't use any powders to set my undereye, I use Mood lightly for an all over glow (mostly on outer part of my cheeks) Luminous on high part of cheek bone and sometimes as a shadow on my brow bone under the brows. I use Radiant Light occasionally,  sometimes,  as a contour or as a light bronzer over bridge of nose. I also have one of their blushes in Mood Exposure which I love. These powders are gorgeous, at least for me, so I don't look so sallow and dull. The only full size I have is Mood Light, the rest are minis from Sephora except the Radiant Light which I had to get directly from Hourglass because Sephora does not carry that one in a mini. I know it sounds like a lot of powders to use, but I have a light hand and don't wear them all at once all the time. Radiant light also looks great on the decollete area for evening if wearing a v neck top. None of them oxidize on me. So there it is, take it for what it's worth from a 60  y/o.",3
I have also have also the Mimosa sunrise/sangria sunset duo and these are one of my favorite colored highlighters of all time I love how they are super shimmery but not too blinding support real excited natural I love mixing the rest shades together to create a gorgeous custom color.,0
"I have always been so intimidated to groom my brows, but this product made it a no-brainer! The loose powder side is genius for a quick boost of oomph, and the pencil side is great if you're going for a glam sculpted look. I would recommend to brow newbies and pros alike!",0
"I have always had a hard time getting my makeup to stay on all day. I received the Mindful 5 Nourishing Primer Serum complimentary from Influenster, and it seriously works wonders. When I applied this serum to my face, it instantly added radiance and shine to my face, and it felt super moisturized. At the end of the day after using this primer, my foundation was still perfectly covering my face and didn't wear off. I am so so happy with this product!",1
"I have always loved Clinique products, that was until I purchased this product. I had just revived my skin from the Drunk Elephant protini polypeptide cream nightmare & purchased this to try to find another moisturizer. It was like my face had dandruff it was so dry...  Idk why I bother with expensive products thinking I'm going to get better results when Olay whipped did a beautiful job of keeping my skin moisturized & soft!! Don't buy this trash it with destroy your skin!!!",3
"I have always steered clear from lip liners because I do not like a defined lip - I usually go for a more blotted, natural lip look. However, the shade She's Humble perfectly matches my natural lip line and effortlessly enhances the shape and size of my lips. Additionally, the staying power of this product is great. I am so glad that I took the plunge and bought this product by Patrick Ta.",3
"I have always wanted to try a Pat McGrath shadow palette, but I couldn't justify the gigantic price tag. I stumbled upon this little guy in the checkout lane at Sephora, and I'm so glad I did!\n\n These shadows have pigment for days, with the exception of the gold shade (Gold Standard). The gold shade is kind of sheer, it's not really up to snuff with the other shades in this palette. The shadows basically blend themselves, and they all look super stunning together. I even tried it with my cheap brushes and was still impressed with the payoff and how they blended. Lapis Luxury is the most beautiful shade I've ever seen in my whole life and I just want to wear it every day! \n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Will I be buying the bigger Pat McGrath palettes? Probably. Honestly, the formula on these shimmers is game changing and definitely worth the hype. I had to knock off a star for the pigmentation of the gold shade. Other than that though, I'm obsessed with this palette and will never let it go!",0
"I have an acne prone skin .The cream was very smooth to apply However when I applied it around the corner of my mouth , and started getting acne around that area . I am not sure it is because of this cream or just my hormones but I never used to get one around my laugh lines . I did notice slight change though . Very easy to apply . If you don’t suffer from acne it might work for you .",0
"I have and love a Smashbox Photo Edit Trio, so I hoped that this would be another good Smashbox eyeshadow purchase to try. But while the trio is buttery smooth, this palette is hard and chalky. The color deposits wherever my brush first hits and I cannot get it to blend. The browns all turn yellow on me as well. This was a waste of money.",3
"I have another retinol serum that I LOVE and even it causes me to peel - I can only use it every three days so that I don't experience too much irritation.\n\nbut holy moly is this serum irritating! the texture itself is so gritty - but thin. hard to explain really. and it makes my face so red and itchy. I certainly would put warnings somewhere if I were them to START with once a week and work your way up. but they fail to do that. it is marketed as a morning and night serum.\n\nit might work wonders if you start slow with once a week but because my face hates it even after one application - and they don't even tell you to go slow - I cannot recommend this.\n\nalso, it's extremely expensive.",1
"I have a sensitive prone to redness skin, my esthetician is against me using AHA or BHA , as a spot treatment only, I also do feel like those are irritating more then they do good.\nThese pads are a different story- super gentle, never felt irritation , never saw redness. \nLasts a while, u dont really need a pad a day, but you can if you want.",1
"I have a ton of nice eyeshadow sets but could never get the hang of using the darker colors as liners--until I got this brush.  It's the ONLY one I've found that puts on a tight, fine line without shedding powder on your cheekbones.  Make the investment, it's a game changer.",3
"I have a version of these that are a number of years old, but I cannot live without them. They perform better for me than any full sized brushes I have. I use them every day, they are exactly what I need. I'd love to see more colors released!",2
I have awful hormonal acne that seems to last a whole two weeks. I'm so obsessed with this product. It noticeably decreases my acne OVERNIGHT. I've only been using it three or so days and I'm so happy with the results.,0
I have been a fan of Bobbie brown makeup my whole life so it doesn't surprise me that I like this palette.  If you know Bobbie browns ethos on makeup this pallets will make sense.  It is a beautiful neutral pallette.,0
"I have been a product junky for a lot of years.  This is the best lipstick I have ever used.  Sometimes I top this with Perricone No Lipstick, often I use alone.  Either way is perfect for my lip color.  I have very dry lips. I cannot not wear most lipsticks, but this is so gentle it rivals products that are for dry lips.",4
"I have been battle breakouts around my chin/jaw for months. a friend gave this to me  to try and I figured ""why not"" I've literally tried almost EVERYTHING. \n\nEver since I have been using this product I have had zero to minimal breakouts and my acne scars have been massively lightened up. Yes, at first it stung but I've also been trying so many things, and dont have very sensitive skin so to me it really wasnt anything. I HIGHLY reccomend this product especially for the cost if your battling acne/acne scars.",4
I have been buying these balms for a few years and they are a staple in our household. We live in Minnesota and our winters are harsh so balm is a must have. This product lasts long and help protect and soothe already chapped lips. They heal faster then all others I have tried. Well worth the money. This kit is a good way to get more for your money and try different flavors they all smell great.,1
"I have been dealing with skin redness for a while and unfortunately, I haven't found anything that helps yet. I thought that perhaps, a higher quality brand would help - so I got a sample of this stuff. \n\nLike everyone else has said, there is a strong fragrance. \n\nI'm not one to mind fragrance in my skin care, though I try to avoid it.\n\nI put this stuff on, and noticed the smell right away. It didn't bother me much, as it's a pleasant smell. However, after 6 hours of wearing it, the scent is still as strong as when I put it on, and it's making me nauseous. \n\nI've noticed a very minimal difference in the redness, but that could also be due to just having an easy-going day. \n\nI was really hoping I could tolerate the smell, but I just can't. I'm about to go wash it off. \n\nI'd HIGHLY recommend that you get a sample of this stuff before you buy a full bottle, even if you can normally tolerate stronger scents.",0
"I have been debating about giving this a 4 or a 3 rating.  Pros: this color Texel is nice for my fair/light skin, with a hint of warmth. And, it's rated as clean.  When I wore it and asked opinions, a few people told me it looked great.  Cons: it is light coverage, not medium.  It does not cover much.  I will likely keep it and use it on casual days when I don't need much coverage.  Another con: it settles significantly into fine lines and wrinkles.  I have to use a setting powder with this, which adds another step in my morning routine. It is also not very hydrating at all, and I have dry mature skin. So overall this is good but not great.  I have other foundations I prefer.",3
I have been enjoying this eye cream. I have used several eye creams from high end brands to drugstore brands. Prior to this brand I was using the caffeine eye cream from the inky list but I didn't feel like it was doing anything for me. I switched to this and my eyes are so hydrated. The formula is on the thicker side. I'm used to lighter creams and serums. This cream dosen't feel heavy or anything on my eyes it's just a different texture. The formula is not sticky. As for the amount of product you get it will last awhile as you only need a small amount for both eyes.,0
"I have been eye balling this palette for a very long time. Once it went on sale, I purchased it right away. The colors are so beautiful and even better in person. The colors blend so well and are so pigmented. Packaging is sturdy. This would be a nice investment and definitely a must have for your palette collection. It is definitely the definition of a sunrise!",0
"I have been eye on this tool since last Christmas. Now I regret the hesitation.  It was the best purchase ever.  It not only can use for facial you can use for whole body.  It cured my stomachache, migraine and menstrual pain. It's amazing. Highly recommend",3
"I have been in love with YTP products and this was certainly not a let down at all. I use this about 3 times a week and man this really tones. My pores have gotten smaller and my skin tone has evened out. I tend to be more red and this really helps. I will say, a little bit goes a long way because it does get sticky.",0
I have been looking for a good mascara for a long time and have finally found it! I love how it doesn't clump and goes on so well. I love the application brush! my eyelashes are naturally pretty long but to find a mascara to really enhase it without clumping but also looks dramatic has been hard for me. this is my go to now.,4
I have been looking for this exact green color and love this brand. I was pleasantly surprised by the pink color - it looks great on my toes. Nails inc. surpasses the other higher-end brands on quality and longevity.,2
I have been loving all the SG spfs lately but this one is definitely my favorite. The price is a bit high but oh man does it feel amazing on the skin. NO WHITE CAST! it absorbs quickly and perfect under makeup,0
"I have been on the hunt for a new cleanser to help with my breakouts. I deal with some serious hormonal breakouts even down my neck and nothing seemed to help. This has been amazing, it doesn't strip my usually dry skin and just makes me feel clean. Not to mention seriously reduces my breakouts. The only thing that is iffy is the smell, but I can get through that because of the effect.",0
I have been searching for a facial cream to relieve my dry skin. I have tried everything from the cheapest to the most expensive and yet nothing seemed to work. I bought this and the 1st time I put it on my face feels like silk. It is truly amazing and a must have. I can wear it under my make up and it does not cause oiliness. It has honestly changed my face. I have received soo many compliments on my skin.,2
"I have been searching for a replacement to my all-time favorite Lancome concealer that was discontinued last year. This comes the closest. Light texture, full coverage, doesn't settle into lines. It takes some effort - the dipstick drops way too much product - to get it spread around evenly",3
"I have been searching tirelessly for a non-powdery option to rosy up my cheeks- something that would bring some youth back to my face tjat wouldn't  look like it was sitting on my cheeks; I wanted a 'glow from witjin' look. I have tried a few options, and was sadly disappointed until I found this. It is buildable, beautiful and gices me that youthful appearance I was looking for. I also use it on my lips, and it is beautiful there, too.",2
"i have been struggling with dark spots !  theyre alot and pretty obvious!! especially when i got pregnant they got even worse. i used this for about 2 weeks ONLY  and noticed a great difference!!! my mom and husband usually don't notice anything and they actually commented on how my face looks smoother, brighter and glowy! \nI Love this!!",4
I have been struggling with smile lines for the past year and the Nuface Fix Line Smoothing Device has been minimizing the appearance of them tremendously. I'm not someone that typically uses this type of product but now I can't travel without it. it prevents fine lines and helps reduce the appearance of them too!,1
"I have been trying out this serum for a little over a week now and have really been liking it. I use about two drops of this serum at night after I wash my face and use toner. I then follow up with the rest of my night time skin routine. I have only been using this product for a short amount of time but have definitely seen a difference in my skins texture, and hydration. This serum is really great and I highly suggest trying it out. I should also mention that I have been using the Josie Maran Argan Bright Skin Vitamin C Serum in the morning and love the way the two serums complement one another. I also love the packaging. The serum looks very luxurious in my bathroom. I am looking forward to seeing how my skin improves as I continue using this product.\nI was sent this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes.",4
"I have been trying the new formula for a month now hoping to grow to like it.  First, my shade number is gone, nude 2w2 is now nude 2n1.  Thinking it would be less of a yellow base (the N), i bought it anyway.  Nope, it is more yellow (many here describe it as orange) and instead of a nice moisturized feeling, my skin and hands feel like i rubbed in petroleum jelly.  It is also irritating around the eyes now. Sad to have to switch after having a daily go to for all of these years.  Any suggestions in the comments welcome.",3
I have been using a lash extended mascara for a couple of years now that I order online. Ran out and couldn't wait for it to be delivered so I grabbed this thinking it would work like I am used to.  It did not!  Can't say that it lengthened my lashes at all no matter how much I put on.  It just became a mess with lashes sticking together like little spider legs.   Will be returning it.  Just not a product that worked well for me.,3
"I have been using another brand that's double the price for the last year with good results. When it was time to order more, I found this higher rated and almost half the price, so decided to try it. My naturally short, stubby lashes grew longer with the other brand but then sort of stalled. Within a week of using MD Lash Enhancing Serum, my lashes are growing faster and fuller than ever before. Seriously, I have tried two $120  serums on the market, plus third around this price, and none of them gave me results like this. Finally found the holy grail of lash serums!",2
"I have been using IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce which I love.  I decided to try this for a change.  It's a thicker cream with a nice light scent.  I can't say there is anything wrong with it, it just doesn't wow me.  I'd say it's a standard night cream that will do the trick for the price.",1
"I have been using it for a few days now and have already experienced some acne on my cheeks. I can also feel one forming on my nose and it is painful. I was really hoping I could find an oil cleanser suitable for acne prone skin that had good ingredients, but sadly I think the sweet almond oil in this one just doesn't agree with me. I'll have to stick with the Clinique balm even though it has polyethylene in it but it's the only thing that doesn't break me out.",4
"I have been using it his for about 2 weeks and I can already see a difference in my skin.  I love how it makes your skin feel, very soft and dewy. I have not used Dr. Jart before, but so happy I tried this, I am loving it!",3
"I have been using the First Aid peeling pads and getting good results.  but i wanted more.  so I bought the mini Universal Peel to use once a,week.  I can't begin to tell you how,great this product is.  I noticed a,difference after one use, but the second got even better results.  I just wish this product wasn't so expensive.  I will definitely buy again",4
I have been using the genefique serum and loving it but wanted to bump up the treatment and try something new. The Lancome rep said this would address more of my concerns. I tried a sample on my hand and immediately was skeptical because I love the texture of the genefique serum... so smooth soothing and as absorbed into my skin. This one ... not so much. It had a lotion feel to it and not so moisturizing. However I bought it to give it a try. I got the gift set with am and pm lotions and some strange silicone eye treatment that looked like a pore filling primer. Anyway... I had to return it all. It was so horribly fragrant. It got in my mouth and tasted awful. Didn't feel nice on my skin either. I wanted to love it but couldn't get past the fragrance and it felt drying. Exchanged for my Genefique Serum I love.,4
I have been using the good genes as well as the a+ retinol and I have to say I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. I have combination skin and I have noticed that my skin is smoother and I don't have as much texture as before. I would recommend these products.,1
"I have been using the Ilia mascara for about a month to give it a fair review.  It goes on nicely, a little light so extra layers are necessary can be added without looking clumpy.  I like the wand, I can get close to my lids without making a mess.  Overall I am happy with the Ilia mascara.",3
"I have been using the IT CC Cream for over 3 years now and it is amazing, however, this, along with the super cream, were pretty disappointing.  I saw no short or long term difference or improvement from using this.  Would not recommend at this price point there are cheaper more effective products.",1
"I have been using the morning rose one for a couple years now, and it's still my favorite lip balm. It's moisturizing and gently pigmented that gives a natural look without giving it an obvious pop of color. highly recommended!",4
"I have been using the OLD FORMULA for over 4 years and it has been discontinued.  I purchased this new one and the powder is HORRIBLE the colors are off, the quality is powdery and make your skin super dry. I returned and I won't buy it again.",4
"I have been using the same BE blush brush for many years and always thinking ""girl, why can't you get your blush on without getting it on too wide and heavy!?""  I couldn't imagine that a different brush could make such a difference!  This blush brush is fabulous!  Picks up a light amount of product and places it precisely so you can go from a barely-there blush to something more defined.  LOVE this brush!!!",3
I have been using these for six months now.  My hair is noticeably thicker as even my hair stylist has commented on it.  It took about 45 days to see a difference.  I will continue to purchase and use these.,3
"I have been using these pads daily for about 3 weeks, primarily at night after removing my makeup and cleansing, but sometimes in the morning as well. I purchased it in the Fablantis set. 3 weeks is a rather short period of time but I can already see results. By the end of the first week I noticed my breakouts had frozen, they hadn't got better necessarily but they hadn't gotten worse. By about 2.5 weeks I noticed that my skin is visibly smoother, my cystic acne has nearly disappeared for the first time in years, and my blackheads are nearly completely gone- something I have grappled with my whole life. My husband has even noticed the difference and has given me compliments. I saw some reviews that say the pad is too large, but this is something I disagree with. I find that the pad is just the right size- I wipe my face completely about 3 times to really get the area well as well as my neck and it is just the right amount. I am absolutely floored that I have found something that works so well for my troubled skin! I hope to never be without this product and I haven't even used it for a whole month yet!",4
"I have been using these pads for 8 days and my skin has been transformed!! For the past few months I have been using Pixi Glow Tonic 8% Glycolic pads. I was out, so I began using the First Aid Beauty Radiance Pads that I had received in a free sample kit from Sephora. Wow!! No burning on my skin when I swept the pad across my face!! I even noticed a change in my skin's texture after the first night. I've been trying to soften some dryness from some cystic acne for months and FINALLY a product that works! I believe it's a combination of the Radiance pads and Rosehip Oil that's doing the trick for me. I just bought new ones yesterday. Highly reccomend these pads!!",4
"I have been using this and love this , daily in my skincare routine it has already giving my skin a glowing effect and reduced the dryness.  I like the smell too it has like an organic plant smell. I also like how it doesnt leave my face too oily",1
"I have been using this cream for 2-3 years now, the smell is amazing, and I seem to grab this in the AM. it has not broken me out, absorbs well, and gives a subtle glow. my only complaint is that it is not that hydrating, especially during winter. overall it is a nice cream, but I felt that it should be more hydrating considering that is what it is used for lol. I found with most orgins products the quality of their products are on the cheaper side of high end brands. even though they smell good, they dont benefit your skin as much as they should for they hype and price.",1
"I have been using this cream twice a week whenever I use the alpha beta daily pads, at night only. The combination of both has given me great results! I've been using the pads for about a year now with very good results, but the combination of both is even better. Definitely worth trying!",3
I have been using this every morning for the past few weeks. My eyes can be a bit puffy in the am and I do feel this helps. I  have the ordinary Caffeine serum for under eyes but it makes my concealer look dry and cracked by the end of the day. I feel like with this cream my under eyes still looks hydrated and my concealer still looks good by the end of the day.,1
"I have been using this eye cream for about 3 or 4 weeks now. The formula is lightweight and creamy, ultra-moisturizing for the eye area. Gentle enough to use all around the eye without irritation. I love the way it feels on the skin and how hydrated and bright I look after application. I have normal skin and I feel great about this product. This would be really great for someone with dry skin, especially in that area.",1
"I have been using this eye cream for about three years now. I like how it absorbs quickly into my skin and it doesn't not irritate my eyes like other eye creams have. I've noticed that my lines around my eyes are very minimal.  I tried another eye cream that is less expensive but it didn't work out. This actually last a long time because you don't have to use much at all. It's worth it, in my opinion.",4
"I have been using this eyeliner for 3 years, I have recieved so many compliments, I have recommended this to so many people, I have loved it. This eyeliner would stay in place all day, it has been my baby, my go to, my life saver... until I purchased a replacement for my empty. The new clinique liner that I purchased last week wasn't nearly as pigmented, and it seemed watery. I took it back thinking I may have purchased a dud, nope, they're all the same. what happened? I'm so sad.",0
I have been using this for 2 months now and I have noticed a slight lightening of my dark circles. It isn't drastic but then the jar is big enough to last me a year. I will continue to use it and see if it more lightening happens. Pity the bottle only says to use it once a day.,1
"I have been using this for 2 weeks.  I know it may be a little early, but I should see a little cellular turnover, right?  2 stars for pretty packaging.  I didn't like the notification that on the box that every purchase a percentage goes to a variety of LGBTQ organizations.  Can you imagine if every time you picked up a box and there was a list of all there good works they donated to?  It just bugged me.  It felt like pandering.",3
"I have been using this for about a month or so almost every night before bed. It help with my dry under eyes a bit but I’m not seeing any major difference. I received this as a complimentary gift but I’m not sure if I would repurchase. There is quite a bit in the container. Skincare doesn’t work for everyone so this could work great on yourself and I am struggling with it, always keep that in mind.",0
"I have been using this for about a year now, along with other products from Tatcha. It has helped transform my skin. I have combination skin, and, due to a health issue, tended to have patches of dry flaking skin that no amount of moisturizer seems to clear up. I hesitated to buy this, simply because of the cost for what looks like water, but this is amazing! I use the essence before a serum and light moisturizer and it adds enough moisture without the patchy and oily skin I've dealt with for so long.",2
"I have been using this for a couple of years and just keep buying more.  That says a lot for me.  I apply with my fingers, blend with a foundation brush as needed around the edges.  It lasts fairly well; it doesn't seem to stay long on my chin, but I think that's because I end up rubbing it off, somehow.  I switch between the 6.5 when I have a little tan in the summer, and 5.5 for the rest of the year.  Definitely worth the price.",3
"I have been using this for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed. I apply it to my wet clean hair /scalp right before styling my hair, I contacted the company and they said this would still work but might take a bit longer for results. I tried applying it to dry scalp and hair but it left a residue and would ruin my hair style. Bottom line, I only apply it after I wash my hair, every couple of days, and with that alone I've seen improvement! My hair is thicker for certain. I haven't noticed new hair growth yet but I'm sure it's coming. If you are able to apply it nightly on dry hair as recommended you will probably see results faster than me, nonetheless I am still so impressed and will continue to purchase this.",3
I have been using this for a few weeks now I'm about a quarter of the bottle left and let me tell you this stuff really works I have good lashes anyway but now they're incredible my friends asked me if I got eyelash extensions it does Sting If you get it in your eye but it only lasts a few seconds and that's only if you're not careful either way I will repurchase and I have recommended this to anybody who has commented on my lashes which happens to be quite frequently it does take a while to work so hang in there it's totally worth it,4
I have been using this for a few weeks now. It makes my skin look radiant. I was using Argan Oil by Josie Marin and I like both of them. I do like the lip balm in this kit. I wear it to bed every night. I used the mask only once. My skin looked great after 15 minutes. Nice!,3
"I have been using this for well over 15 years, it is a staple in my skincare regimen and won't go without it,  does the job without irritation. Kept my skin clear and polished looking with no breakouts and has no scent and no rough grains in it.  I am more than thrilled that Sephora now carries it.",3
"I have been using this for years. I love the product itself, I do not like the new packaging whatsoever. The color is nice and the coverage is good and has been my go-to for a long time now. I do not like the way they changed the packaging though because I feel like you get less product, the crappy sponge is in the way and you can't get all of the product out of the corners with a large brush. The round one was perfect as the sponge was out of the way and was more functional.",0
I have been using this foundation for a couple of years.  Great coverage for my mature skin.  Color is absolutely perfect (went into store for first purchase to get assistance in finding my shade).  Apply with Becca foundation brush --using only a very small amount of product. Not heavy but still conceals redness and imperfections.,4
I have been using this liner before I was sent this package for reviewing purposes. This liner has always been my go-to! I always use it as my last step after putting on falsies or correcting the liner that may have smudged with the eyeshadow. It's a opaque black which really brings out the eyes ! It glides on easily and lasts me throughout my 8hr working day. Would definitely recommend.,1
"I have been using this magic potion for 2 weeks.. it is simply wonderful, silky, hydrating and luxurious. A little goes a long way..1 to 2 drops is all I use in the morning.I then layer a small amount of Laura Mercer SPF base.., all day perfect. My skin is hydrated and Glowy all day. For some extra glow add a little Kevyn Aucoin prism Highliter. What a wonderful product, packaging is lovely to look at. Love this line, great purchase!!!!",4
I have been using this mineral sunscreen for about 15 years and was elated to learn that Sephora still has some in stock after Shiseido discontinued it in favor of a chemical formula.  I bale hay for five months of the year and I do not get on a tractor without applying this first.  I reapply every few hours.  The milk formula is not oily and does not cause blemishes on me. It has been over 100 degrees for two weeks and I can attest that it does not slip with sweat.   I will purchase this formula until stocks are depleted and then will research other mineral sunscreens to replace it.,3
"I have been using this moisturizer in my nighttime routine for the last couple weeks.  It leaves my skin perfectly moisturized in the morning without clogging my pores.  I  have combo skin, leaning more towards oily.  Definitely oily in the summer.  My skin looks better than it ever has.  It's only been a couple weeks with great results, I'm sure over time it will only get better.  I'm glad I found the perfect cream that isn't too heavy or break me out.  I couldn't be more happier, this will be a staple for sure!",2
I have been using this palette for months now and I couldn't be happier!  The colors are wonderfully buildable and and can be mixed to create multiple looks.  It is limited edition so I am buying extra.,3
"I have been using this powder as my main powder for about 4 months now, but am still not sure if this is my holygrail powder. However, it is the best I have found so far. It doesn't do much in the realm of color correcting, especially since all the colors end up mixing together a little. However, it does leave my face looking poreless, smooth and does not sink into any fine lines.",0
I have been using this product consistently over the last two months and my skin has a lot less texture and bumps. when I do get the occasional pimple it's much smaller and clears up in a day or two. I highly recommend this product to try and if it doesn't work for particular skin type it's not a huge loss,4
"I have been using this product for 6 weeks now. I only use it as a moisturizer so I can only provide a review concerning the moisturising aspect of the product.  When I use the drunk elephant hydra-B serum along  with this mist, my t-zone becomes oily during the day. I do use this product AS DIRECTED. 1-2 sprays at the most. However when I use a different serum, the oily t-zone is not an issue. I can not determine if the oiliness is stimulated from the drunk elephant  or this tatcha spray. I really do enjoy both products and will continue to use. However I am surprised that I have not broken out in my t-zone area from the oiliness. Would I repurchase? probably not because   it does not take much my t-zone to become oily but it does provide a nice dewy glow to my complexion.   For extra hydration I normally use the clinique moisture surg spray which I really love. Sephora and Macy's were completely out of the spray so I decided to purchase this spray as a substitute.  Overall someone with dry skin, this will benefit from this mist.  Oily or combination skin may not so much (considering the type of cleanser, toner, essence & serum). If you have oily and/ or combo skin I defiantly wouldn't use a hydrating serum on top of this.",4
"I have been using this product for about a month and never seemed to get it right. It's very heavy and just doesn't settle in, always leaves a cast. As a result of the lack of absorption, it does not hydrate my skin; just sits on top. But, it hasn't broken it out or irritated it. Since I've been using it for so long with no results, it's kind of a chore at this point, and won't be continuing use.",0
I have been using this product for about two weeks and I can definitely see a difference. The spots around my forehead have dramatically diminished. The spot around my lip is completely gone. The only advise I'd say is to make sure you follow the instructions for pressing down the spots otherwise they won't stay on. Overall great product!,4
"I have been using this product for a couple of years now, but I decided I wanted to try other product when I noticed alcohol denat was one of its ingredients. After having tried a few other eye creams, I must say this is my favourite, despite my preference to avoid alcohol. I find this price point acceptable for its effectiveness. \n\nIts rich texture is moisturizing and it helps reduce the swelling significantly under my eyes, compared to other eye creams. I also didn't think it did much for my dark circles but I noticed them looking darker with other products. \n\nI currently use this at night so my eyes look refreshed in the morning, and I'm using a more lightweight gel product for the daytime.",1
I have been using this product for a few months now and have not noticed any significant changes in the direction I am hoping for. I have thin hair that seems to have gotten less dense over the past few years. My scalp shows through much of the time unless my hair is freshly washed and blow dried. I still have high hopes for this product but unfortunately I have not yet seen any results.,0
I have been using this product for a few years and feel it provides much needed protection on my aging hands.  I apply it to the back of my hands and smear any residual further up my wrists.  Don't wait until you get old to use sun protection.,3
"I have been using this product for over a.month. I love it. I will be 60 this year, and I love the way it feels before my concealer application. I don't have any idea how some find it difficult to apply. it is a custard-like consistency.   just tap your ring finger in, just enough product will adhere to your finger and tap it (do not rub) under your eyes.",4
"I have been using this product off and on for over five years and highly recommend it for people with redness in the cheek and chin areas.  It also acts as a makeup primer, so you get two products in one.",3
I have been using this serum for about a month now and it is amazing! It sinks in very quickly into my skin and I've noticed some of my acne scars lighten. Definitely going to repurchase when I run out!,1
"I have been using this serum for a little over a week now and have been enjoying it a lot. I use about two drops in the morning. I after I put on the serum I then use a hyloronic acid serum and moisturizer. The serum is very light and drys nicely on the skin. I am honestly not a big fan of the scent but have gotten used to it and barely notice it now. After using this serum for over a week I noticed how bright, even and hydrated my skin looks. My skin also feels very soft. I should also mention that I have been using the Josie Maran Argan Smooth Skin Resurfacing Serum at night and love the way the two serums complement one another. I am looking forward to seeing how my skin improves as I continue using this product.\nI was sent this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes.",4
"I have been using this set for more than a month. The products are nothing special and the face cream gave me a bad rash for a week. The fragrance is nice but way overpowering - I almost gagged when I first tried the products. I had high hopes because of the rave reviews. I wouldn't mind the prices as much IF they actually worked well. Sadly, they mostly just made my skin feel sticky with an overwhelming smell.",2
"I have been using this toner day and night for about 7 months straight. It did help in minimizing my pores but I found it did absolutely nothing for my red marks, which is what I most look for in a toner. It did dry out my skin for the first while, now I am just sure to lotion right after or it does dry my skin out... the smell is also a bit alcohol-y.",1
I have been using this trying to get rid of it as I paid full price for the big one instead of testing it first (bad idea). I love the colour and the way it makes my skin look but NOT the way it makes my skin feel. I can feel it on my face all day and by the end of the day it ends up looking really patchy. I use a lot of setting spray to prevent this from happening but would not buy again :( which sucks cause I love tarte products,0
I have been using this undereye cream for 2 weeks. I find that the formulation go on so smooth and I have seen a noticeable difference in my undereye hydration. I cannot say yet if I notcie much change to my fine lines (I do not have many). The smell is so refreshing with a hint of some cucumber.,1
"I have been using this under\neye primer for years. I have very dry skin under my eyes and I cannot use concealer without this product. I only use a little before concealer, after my eye cream and it works beautifully. It does not claim to brighten, nor do I think it does that job. It hydrates and prolongs the wear of my concealer. Lovely product.",4
"I have been wanting a superfine mist without sensitizing fragrant plant oils and fragrance for a long time, but it just didn't exist. This filled that void for me!\n\nIt isn't fragrant, and it is such a fine mist that I can use it any time. I like to use this especially immediately after stepping out of the shower and patting my face dry. It helps keep my skin moist while I dry off my body and put my hair up in preparation for the rest of my skincare. \n\nI loved they so much that I bought a second one to keep in my bag or beside my bed when I wake up feeling dehydrated from burying my face in my pillow. I'm so excited to have this!",0
"I have been wanting this for so very long and finally decided to purchase it in this shade. For reference,  i am a nc20 or n1 in Dior backstage, 2n1 cashew in Laura mercier flawless lumiere radiance foundations. I'm not super fair but I'm not medium either, I'm a solid light with neutral leaning warm undertones and this shade is perfect for me. I used it under my foundation (which was Givenchy teint courture everwear foundation) and on top of it after I set it with huda beauty setting powder, I applied it where highlighter would normally go and it was beautiful. Didn't disturb my set foundation or move it around either and lasted until I washed my face which was a good 12 hours of wear. I can't believe I didn't get this sooner. it is also so lovely worn on the collar bone and shoulders. A Very little bit of product goes and extremely long way. One pump did my entire face under my foundation and it only took one pump onto my hand and applied with a beauty blender onto the high points of my face for highlighter. I am going to try putting the Marc Jacobs powder luminizer in their new shade over it tomorrow when I wear it just to see what happens, lol. I'll update on my profile under my looks since i can't update my review (if there is a way to update reviews, please let me know) . I want to try the new tantalize shade now. might be a great bronzer.",1
"I have both we love her and we need her. This highlighter is to DIE for! For everyone who said it leaked don't buy it, they actually updated the packaging. I had mine leak when I bought it for launch and they changed it right away. This highlighter is beautiful! I love spraying it everywhere and I can't believe I got the fan but it is quite useful with this product.",1
"I have chronically dry and dehydrated skin that never seems to fully drink in any skin care I apply ... until I met this toner! I tap it onto my face after cleansing, pressing into my skin and suddenly my face is dewy and glowing with no irritation ... and the hydration lasts! I wake up and my skin still feels plump and hydrated, which never happens. I’m obsessed.",0
"I have clinically dry skin and this foundation did not disappoint! It does not dry matte, but slightly dewy, which has been a blessing for my skin type. I don't work at a pretty desk job; I can work 10-12hr shifts as a veterinary assistant. My job is go-go-go and always physical and messy. I've used tarte's Amazaonian clay foundation stick before with horrible results, as it did not match my skin type. Dior as well wasn't suitable for my skin. This foundation however is, and it's even enough to last through my grueling shifts. I don't use setting spray and it can last me 8hrs before it starts to slide in certain areas, but if I put in the effort to really set my makeup, I have no doubt this could last another few hours easily.\n\nAmazing product! ❤",0
"I have combination dry skin and most moisturizers are either too watery or too oily. I tried this first on a 10 hour flight, and my skin was not dry at all during the flight. I was so impressed. Now I use it as an overnight mask, which works really well on improving the texture of my skin. I highly recommend to people who have combination skin.",1
"I have combination/dry skin, my concerns are aging related but this is my most favorite TH mask.\n My skin is plump, calm and clear afterwards, I really enjoy it.  When being removed, you have to add a little water and exfoliate in little circles for a minute before completely removing. Gives Beautiful skin even non drying for winter,  though I probably use an oil plus a moisturizer afterwards.",2
"I have combination skin, a little on the oily side, that is prone to cystic acne. I struggle with finding any skincare products that actually work for me and provide the nutrients and anti aging qualities I want. I usually buy the water cream from tatcha because it actually doesnt break me out and the other reviews were so good. it costs a pretty penny though, and also contains alcohol and gold (which is unnecessary, I dont know how I feel about putting it on my face either) so I took a LOT of time to find a similar, GOOD replacement that is still a water like cream. I used skin charisma to look up the ingredients and effects by skin type, and this seemed to be the best candidate in comparison to the water cream, glacier skin cream by saturday skin (prolly my second choice to this), dewy skin cream (fungal acne trigger), protini, clinique surge, and caudalie sorbet. I chose this because the ingredients are clean, alcohol free, and include many benefits like anti aging, antioxidants, oil inhibitor, and acne fighting. the consistency is similar to the water cream, but a little more rich in texture. a little goes a long way. I love that it is in a tube as well so that the ingredients stay potent for longer. I've used it for a few weeks now and so far no bad skin reactions, a significant minimization of pores and oiliness, and soft, hydrated skin. it may feel like it applies a little gel like at first similar to the glacier cream but it absorbs quickly like the water cream, which I love!",0
"I have combination skin, but I find this moisturizer to be a bit drying and too thin. However, overall, it is a good moisturizer with no white cast. It doesn't cause any breakouts, but I'll go back to Josie Maran Spf47 moisturizer that is more ""rich"".",4
"I have combination skin, I still breakout and I have issues with acne scarring. On top of that anything with fragrance gives me a rash. I feel like this helps minimize my breakouts as well as improve my skin texture.",0
"i have combination to oily prone skin with redness. This cushion texture is comfortable on skin and doesnt feel tacky.  Natural to satin finish. Almost fragrance free. Barely to minimal oxidize.\n1 star down for the shade is quite lighter than expected, recommend to go 1 shade darker than ur regular match.\n1 star down for the packaging and the sponge come with the package, sponge size is too small, the case design doesnt feel handy...",4
I have combination to oily skin depending on the season. This was highly recommended because I also have sensitive skin and redness at times. Unfortunately it doesn't dry down at all and leaves my face tacky all day long. Can't return because I accidentally threw out the gift receipt. Very disappointed.,4
"I have combo oily skin and my ""go to"" for years has been the CoverFx Mattifying Primer.  But when I started running low, I decided to give this a try as a potential alternate.  So far this is just as good as the CoverFx in my opinion.  But time will tell in the coming month as the cooler weather arrives and I start wearing my non-matte foundations.  Using it with my matte foundations has been great!",0
"I have combo oily skin and the it Cosmetics Confidence in a Gel Lotion works so well on my skin.  Most moisturizers are usually too heavy, but this gel absorbs quickly into skin providing just the right amount of hydration.",2
"I have combo skin with an oily T zone. I exfoliate using my clarisonic but I often still got breakouts on my cheeks. After using this peel, it revealed how much dead skin I was leaving behind on my cheeks! my face felt soft as silk and glass-like just on the first use!",4
"I have combo skin with rosacea and I tend to get really dry patches on my cheeks and nose. I'm also 32 and I wanted something that would help soften any fine lines I was getting. I love this! It absorbs quickly so, I was skeptical at first but, my face was noticeably smoother and softer after the first use. After just a few days, I noticed that, even while removing my makeup, my skin felt totally different. I've had no dry patches and, because of how fast it absorbs, I've started using it on my lips too and I can see a huge difference in texture. It doesn't aggravate my skin and never makes me look or feel greasy. If using under makeup, put it on before brushing your teeth. By the time you're done, it will have absorbed enough that it wont cause piling when applying primer. I love it, a little goes a long way and I'll definitely be repurchasing!",1
"I have combo to dry skin with little wrinkles. Bought a small size to try, hoping it would solve my issues. Love the smell, texture, goes on smooth. All in all a good product, but it did not work for me. I put it during the day after the face oil, it my face was dry by 1 pm, like really dry. Put it overnight on the top of the serum, and it did not absorb at all. I washed my face with water and it was extremely dry again. Have to return now....too bad, had high hopes for it",1
"I have combo to oily skin that turns into an oil slick with humidity/heat. This powder makes my makeup last long work days in Hawaii heat with no caking in my face lines and no oil. I've tried fenty, laura mercier, and kat von d, and none of them hold up like this one and they always caked, creased, didn't help that much with oil, or picked up my foundation. Despite this mattifying me, it still looked natural. Absolutely a holy grail! \n\n2 cons worth mentioning, I feel that it does darken my foundation and concealer a tad bit so if you're contouring underneath the eyes, use a brightening powder after using the Too Faced one. This might not work for the fairest of skin tones. There's also a slight peach/pink tint. 2nd con is that there's a light peach smell so if you're really sensitive to smell, this might not be it.\nI gave this product 5 stars because the cons don't affect me but they might with someone else.",0
"I have consciously made the move towards a clean makeup routine. While lips and mascaras are still a little tricky in my opinion, clean concealer is a must in my opinion. I love all Ilia products and this was a recent acquisition for me after having tried and used RMS. The consistency of the True Skin Serum Concealer is creamy but not too much so and goes on easily. I use a medium sized foundation brush and gently using a patting motion for natural coverage. I then go in and lightly time with my fingers. It's great for spot treating as well. Note that it's also in a tube, which I think is more sanitary than a tube where you are constantly dipping your fingers or a brush in and ultimately bringing in bacteria. Would highly suggest to anyone looking for a great green concealer!",0
"I have curly hair and follow a ""curly girl"" routine - no silicones, no sulfates, etc. I'm sure a lot of curlies would say a salt-based product is not great for curly hair, but I love this product. There aren't many ""beach spray"" or sea salt hair products that don't also contain silicone. (I used to use Bumble",2
"I have dealt with blackheads, adult acne, and a superbly oily T-zone which encompasses the entire middle of my face for 20 years now. I was looking for a clean, affordable skin care line to try and found this. My skin absolutely loves this line. My pores are cleared out, the oil is about 95% gone, and the big pimples I would get monthly have disappeared.  Finally I am able love my skin again. It hasn't looked this good in a long time.  While I still have lines under my eyes and somewhat big pores, my skin looks so shiny and healthy and plump. Thank you Sephora!",3
I have dry acne prone skin and use sqaulene oil...but wanted to give this a try to take care of my dark spots. it gave me tiny rashes and did not help the dark spots or the dryness. Not meant for me. Also has a old oil kinda smell that lingers all day long,1
"I have dry but acne prone skin with lots of black and whiteheads, which is a nightmare in the more extreme seasons. I'm in my early thirties and my skin is starting to change a bit, so my old routine wasn't quite doing it for me. This oil has seen me from summer to winter and my skin has seen some of its best months under its care. I highly recommend it!",1
"I have dry, sensitive skin with no acne. This product made my face break out in small, red, hives. I'm writing this review, so people who have only tried a lightly formulated lactic acid treatment should spot test this before going full face. This product is very potent.",1
"I have dry skin and Im in my mid 30s, and I find this products really gentle and hydrating! I try to avoid face toner that contains alcohol since Alcohol can make my skin drier. and yes Im falling in love with laneige cream toner! refreshing and moisturizing at the same time. I use it everyday, morning and evening before my serum and moisturizer, I really like it! \nI will repurchase for sure!",2
I have dry skin and sometimes it's so dry around my mouth that the skin peels and flakes. I took this supplement and my face was less dry and my mouth area stopped peeling. I purposely did not change my diet or took any other supplement while taking this product.,4
"I have eczema and recently suffered a major flare up that required hospitalization. During the shedding process of my skin, I decided to use this because I felt the Cetaphil just wasn’t hydrating my skin enough. This soap is amazing! My skin is soft, hydrated and non-itchy when I get out the shower. A little goes a long way. I would recommend anyone with sensitive or eczema prone skin to use this. I will be trying the other body creams from their eczema line.",1
I have eczema patches and sensitive acne congested skin.  I use this daily ONLY in the areas where I tend to break out.  This product has made my skin become less congested and has made a huge difference in the slow process of getting rid of impurities.,1
"I have emptied at least 6 bottles of this red bottle serum during the past 3 years. I also use other serum products from la mer, kiehls, lancome, clarins from time to time, but this concentrate has always been my safety net. When my skin was too irritated from dryness or getting flakey in the winter, this is the only thing that soothes my skin. I will keep trying new stuff, but will never stop re-purchasing this one!",0
"I have every standard retail size of this cream. My notes:\n\n1. it smells better on me than in the jar. Also, the scent seems to last forever. \n2. it does not reduce cellulite but it WILL temporarily firm the skin.\n3. it does have a slight shimmer to it.\n4. unlike some other moisturizers, bum bum cream doesn't leave a greasy residue. \n5.  people compliment me almost every time I wear it. \n\nPersonally, I find the scent is a bit funky in the jar, but it's grown on me, and I seem to catch myself smelling my own skin when I wear it. although it is on the pricey side, it's well worth it.",3
"I have every treasure pot except for Pride which I plan on getting very soon.  I am not at all happy with the runny consistency of this jar.  Usually, the glitter is more of a paste- which gives better glitter payoff.   But trying to get anything out of this jar is a smearing liquidy mess.  I usually use a blender as the glitter will get stuck to my fingers, but it wound up taking most of my blush and base highlighter with it.  Not happy, but as a collector I can't bring myself to return it.  I would still recommend this product but less for face and more for hair.",1
"I have fair to light skin and a little bit of redness on my cheeks. I use A TEENY TINY amount, mixed into my moisturizer and my skin looks fabulous. If I squeeze out just a smidgeon too much though I look like I tried to give myself a self tanning spray, oompa oompa style. So less really is more with this product. I use a lot of drunk elephant products (Framboose, b-hydra, protini, marula oil and sunscreen if going outside) and since really going all in I actually don't wear tinted moisturizer anymore. So I really love putting a little bronzini into my moisturizer for some colour. But no more need to cover my skin! I'm basically blemish free and this product hides whatever buildup I might have in my pores on a bad day. Also I dont like this mixed with the oil, really is too greasy for me.",4
"I have fine lines in the under eye area. I have watched so many YouTube videos and tried so many concealers. this is by far the best, easy to blend, easy to build coverage, and DOES NOT settle into the lines!! love it.",2
"I have found it to be a cult favorite for a reason! This formula is so unique in that it is not drying, yet stays put. And the creamy texture fills in the lines of your lips making them appear plumper. I love using this all over the lips, then a deeper shade in the corners to enhance the plump illusion. I just throw a clear or tinted gloss on top and voila!",0
"I have full but short, naturally curled lashes that just need a slight lift. I like dryer formulas with big fluffy brushes that give me fluttery feminine lashes and seperates - rather than joining - my lashes. \nThis added more length, lasted without flaking, and performed all of the above needs I have in a mascara. \nI took a star off because the hour glass brush end bulb bit is just so big I can't use it without coating my upper lid with mascara. So I have learned to put my mascara on before doing my eye make up when I use it. \nI am using the two samples I got from ordering, but I will be purchasing a full tube when they are finished.",3
"I have Glowing Jen and J. K. Magic. Glowing Jen is a daily go to for work. It's a beautiful neutral that goes with everything. It's my lips, but better. J. K. Magic is great with a smoky eye. It's a shade I bought specifically for that. Try these. They are outstanding.",4
I have gotten this as a sample a couple of times and it does nothing. I don't notice any effect on my dark circles or fine lines. Maybe its meant for younger skin with puffiness? Definitely not for the middle aged.,2
"I have had a hard time finding the right eyebrow brush for pomade and powders. They all seemed to either pick up too much product or be too think for a precise application for my sparse brows (I have to really work for to make a proper arch and tail). I have the abh brushes and they just couldn't do what I needed for whatever reason. This brush is super thin and pretty firm to make hairlike strokes. It works perfectly with the kvd Brow powder too. I am super impressed with the application precision of this brush. Yeah, it does suck not having a spoolie on the end, but my brows don't care. If you aren't having luck with other brow brushes, definitely give this one a try.",2
I have had cystic acne on my chin and occasionally my nose since since my late 30's. I see a dermatologist for this. I was told by my doctor to remove my makeup and THEN use the acne wash on my problem areas. \n\nThe company that made my sulphur face was discontinued the version I used and replaced it with a new version for $200 for 8 oz per bottle AFTER insurance.\n\nI went into my Sephora looking for a sulphur face wash. I was recommended this and the mask. This works so well. I first remove my makeup with my favorite makeup remover and THEN I wash my T-zone with just a pea sized amount. It doesn't dry me out and my cystic acne only pops up under major times of stress. I then use the One the Spot sulphur treatment.,4
"I have had oily skin since my teens and I am now in my mid-50’s and have never found a foundation whether it be liquid or powder that didn’t look like it was “sitting” on top of my skin with all of my pores completely filled with makeup.  This is the first product that makes my skin look like I don’t have any makeup on, it just looks better.  Pleas don’t stop making this product, it took me way too long to find this skin “magic”.",3
"I have had perioral dermatitis and severe dry patches for several years now, and it usually is worse in the winter. I bought this foundation on a whim during the fall VIB sale and my dryness issues are considerably diminished. I was just looking for a foundation that wouldn't get crusty on my dry patches, but this foundation has IMPROVED the condition of my skin in general. I am crossing my fingers and knocking on wood that it will continue to be effective. I'm really enjoying not having to be worried about my skin all the time. It is such a relief.",4
I have had several neck and shoulder surgeries and for every 5 pumps or so I got 1 pump that actually spritzed product. I did not feel it showed up that well either (as you can see from attached pic) and it felt greasy and did not absorb well into the skin. This was exactly what I have been searching for but sadly for me was an epic fail. I returned and the search continues.....,3
"I have had the hardest time finding an eye cream that works to hydrate my often bleeding-and-cracked-they're-so-dry eye lids and under eye. This eye cream has been an absolute God send. Hydrates and soothes without the painful sting or burn, depuffs and lightens any redness from my reactions. I'm prone to contact dermatitis and sudden reactions and so far this eye cream has helped in every way. This is an absolute must try if you're looking for an eye gel that is lightweight but incredibly effective for soothing, dry, cracked, sensitive, puffy and discolored eye areas.",0
"I have incredibly sensitive and very acne-prone skin and this little jar is a must have. I've switched to other moisturizers but this is the best. Never has broken me out. I love the packaging but still wish it came with a pump for sanitary/time restraint reasons. When you get down to the bottom of the jar, the metal spatula doesn't have the angles to get it all. \n\nSometimes my skin gets dry because of acne products and if I add 3-4 drops of The Ordinary Rose or Jojoba to this, it's gorgeous.",4
"I have Kopari Coconut Deodorant in Coconut and in Gardenia.  The Gardenia is my favorite, because it smells fresh and clean.  The Coconut smells like coconut oil, and it actually smells kind of oily...not fresh smelling to my nose. Scent aside, both formulas work beautifully for me.  I used Lavanila Deodorant for many years (and highly recommend it) and I also use MegaBabe deodorant, and I have come to the conclusion that Kopari , unlike these non-aluminum products, seems to control perspiration as well as neutralize odor. (Most just neutralize or cover up odor). Other non-aluminum deododorants don't absorb moisture well if they don't contain baking soda (which fries my pits). Somehow Kopari managed to get a formula that seems to keep perspiration at bay, along with removing bad smells. One thing that I have to do for this to work the way I like is I apply a LOT more than I would a regular anti-perspirant.  I apply Kopari in a thick layer, all over my underarms and around the outsides of my underarms.  When I was in the shower, it feels like a layer of wax is coming off, but that""s what I need for this to work like an antiperspirant.  There are days I still use Clinique Antiperspirant, because I simply cannot take the chance of having perspiration and odor, but for everyday wear, including yoga, etc. Kopari does the job, and does it well.",3
"I have light olive skin and it has been a monumental task trying to find a foundation that isn't yellow, orange or pink toned and after sampling 100 different foundations (yes that many!!) I am soooo happy that I found jouer that actually has a shade that caters to olive  skin tones. you only need a teeny tiny drop to cover your whole face and I buff it into my skin with a foundation brush. other makeup plays beautifully and it lasts all day. also love the fact that it is oil free and doesn't make me break out or clog my pores.",4
"I have literally never used a lipstick this smooth.  If any lipstick is described as ""glides on like butter,"" it's not as butter as this one.  I tried it in store and immediately had to purchase it.  Yeah unfortunately it transfers but that's just how most lipsticks are.",0
I have long lashes but nothing seems to hold the curl and give me volume. THIS DOES! I love this mascara. Looks like I have fake lashes. I am surprised I saw bad reviews but I think two thin coats are best. Will definitely buy again. Worth the money.,2
"I have long yet thin lashes so I am ALWAYS looking for a mascara that will actually plump...I prefer my mascara on the "" older"" side because I like the texture better. with that said it tends to be clumpy...enter Pat McGrath labs Fetish Eyes!!! this stuff is the real deal!! couple of coats front and back and I swear im wearing falsies...the reason for 4 not 5 stars...it flakes...by the end of the day I'm seeing flakey fall out...such a shame but on gonna keep using it because the benefits outweigh the flakes!!!",3
"I have looked for my holy grail mascara for years. I have oily lids and usually end up with raccoon eyes by the end of the day. This stuff stays on my lashes. It stays on until you take it off, and when you want to take it off you don’t need industrial strength solvents to do so, just water. Love love love.",3
"I have many foundations, it's a but if an obsession, however nothing quite compares to this. It melts so beautifully into the skin and leaves you with a soft glow. I have combo skin and this pairs amazingly with the Laura mercier translucent loose powder. I'm so glad I took a chance on this because I'm not generally into tartes foundations.",0
"I have medium beige skin, with brownish pink lips. This lip oil was basically just a regular oil with no tint whatsoever. I get the same results from using any carrier oil or vaseline. Not worth the price, nothing special at all, and it even felt a bit sticky on my lips for a while. If you have lighter skin or want a convenient applicator, this product could work for you. But it was useless for me.",1
"I have medium warm skin, this is such a natural glowy bronzer with a teensy bit of shimmer-glow and its perfect! I tried Marc Jacobs omega bronzer and prefer the slight subtle  shine in this bronzer. i bought this 2 years ago and still havent found another bronzer I like better.",3
"I have mild-moderate rosacea, and was recommended to use this line of products.  Got a sample kit with all of them, and I see zero difference from any of them. I wish it worked for me since so many other love it  : / Only thing I have found to help is straight up pure CBD oil (anti-inflammatory)",1
"I have mixed feelings about this. At $25, considering the Urban Decay lipstick by itself is $22, it's a steal.\nUnfortunately, the Urban Decay and Anastasia colors are basically the same, with the Anastasia being more brown. If you like nudes, it's great.\nThe Tarte lip balm looks dark in the tube, but gives just the barest hint of color and is very minty and glossy.\nThe Laura Mercier and Bite colors are nice.\nThe packaging, however, is kind of uselses after it's opened.\nI recommend, but with reservations.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this product. I love how this product makes my skin feel. It makes make makeup apply so much better after. And after a week the little white dots on my face started cleaning. \n\nThe downside, and this is a BIG one, it sticks to my peach fuzz. It is so annoying. I spend at least 7 minutes picking it off my face. I never knew I had such a hairy face.",2
"I have moderate rosacea, but I get some pretty bad flair ups that burn and sting. And this is so soothing. It is so moisturizing  I got this set in April - it’s now November and I’m just using up the very last of the product. I didn’t use it every day but I probably used each of these maybe 10 or more days a month. So there is a lot of product in the packaging. Overall I am impressed with home quickly it soothes my skin, and how it helped prevent flair ups on days when I knew it might happen.",0
I have never been so in love with a mascara in my life. The brush is designed perfectly to coat every single lash while volumizing and curling! You dont have to layer it on like most other mascaras. The formula doesn't clump and its so long lasting! There is no doubt in my mind i will be purchasing this product as soon as i run out! Thank you so much influenster I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,0
"I have never been so pleased with a palette of highlighters and blushes as I am with Hourglass Ambient. I can use these on my eyes, cheeks, and contouring. I am impressed with the staying power also. This is a treat for your face and skin!",4
"I have never had a chemical peel before and now I know why.  With my skin being so sensitive it was very uncomfortable to use.  It may work for other people, but it just isn't for me.  I so wish it would have.  I have heard so many great things about this brand.",4
"I have never hated an eyeshadow palette more! I have about 10 palettes and this one is the worst I've ever tried. If I hadn't already thrown all the packaging and slips away, I would return it in a heartbeat. Tried the color called Crazy Rich, and it was almost invisible. Unless you count the chunks and flakes all over my face. I changed brushes and even tried a sponge applicator, tried it on the back of my hand, nothing. It has zero pigment, doesn't show up at all on the skin, and flakes all over the place. I then tried Bronzed Bod, directly beneath it on the palette. Thought it would be weak as well, so swiped a good bit on my eyelid and holy smoky eye!! It was dark and smudgy and impossible to blend. I ended up using powder foundation to try to blend it out and almost just gave up. And it was also super messy and half ended up on my face. I can't tell you how I loathe this palette!! It sucks. I would give it away, but I wouldn't wish these messy, cheap seeming eye shadow on anyone. Seriously, can't believe this stuff got any positive reviews. It's awful. Would not recommend!",2
"I have never tried Retinol cream so I was a bit hesitant at first. I love results! My face had a beautiful,  healthy,  youthful glow and was so smooth and soft! My pores pretty disappeared.  However, I hate the fact that I had to suffer for 3-4 days. The next day after I applied the cream, there was a visible reaction. Small bumps, slight redness, slight swelling, some tingling and itching. The reason I gave this product 5 stars is simply because I love the results.",2
"I have never used an eye cream before, as I haven't had a problem with my eye area... however I'm starting to develop fine lines under my eyes (I work out in the sun on a daily basis) so I wanted to try something to prevent them from developing further. \nI've used this product for a week and have seen a reduction in the fine lines for sure! The skin underneath my eyes definitely feels more plump and hydrated. I don't see any improvement in darkness (I don't have much to begin with anyways) but overall it's not a bad product. Plus it smells really good and you don't need much product.",1
"I have never used a primer that made my base makeup look so good. It looks like I'm not wearing any makeup at all! I wish they made a smaller bottle of this, I know I won't go through a whole bottle before it expires so I don't want to waste my money.",4
"I have never used the bum bum cream previously, but had heard so many good things about it that I decided to go all in with this set.  I'm so glad that I did!  There isn't an item that I don't love.  Guess, i'm lucky that i'm among the many that enjoy this scent.  I use all of the items in this set regularly and will soon be looking for a refill on that body wash.",1
"I have never written a review before in the 7 years i’ve been on here for. I suffered with teenage acne and still suffer in my 20s. My face was starting to clear up so well but still had scars and discolor. Decided to give this a try and it is the worst decision. My face completely broke out from this, even cystic which i’ve never had much of. Definitely a no for me.",0
"I have no idea what the negative reviews are about. The handle is awkward to hold? What's awkward about it? This is honestly the best foundation brush I have ever used and I have a stippling, paintbrush style and a few others. What I love about this brush is how soft and densely packed the hairs are. I go all over my face with it in circles and there are no streaks or areas left uncovered. I then take a damp beauty blender and dab my whole face before setting with the Hourglass Veil translucent powder. The foundation looks FLAWLESS on my face and I don't feel I have perfect skin. I have some pores on my cheeks but this brush is amazing and I have so much control over how much foundation I want to use. I'll squeeze some foundation onto the back of my hand and pick up from there. I get compliments on how flawless my make up looks. It's the only foundation brush I've been using since I got this one last year. Just amazing!",2
"I have no idea what this smells like but I LOVE it, somewhere between a campfire and cinnamon?? On a more serious note, I have very dry skin and live in a desert climate and it seems hard to find a primer these days that isn't aimed at ""mattifying oil control"". This primer is super hydrating but dries down to a sticky texture. I've used it for about a week and have noticed my foundation sticks for a full day without rubbing off around my nose like it normally does. Does what it says it should!",0
"I have no idea why so many people ranked this mask so highly. That mask did not even come close to fitting on my face--the eye holes were weird and small and product got in my eyes as a result. Pretty much all the proportions for the eyes/nose/chin areas are off. I have no clue whose face this mask would fit, without them having to cut it and manipulate it prior. Furthermore, the mask itself was just meh. I didn't notice any significant change after. It just felt like I had normally washed my face--cleanish but nothing special. It didn't get rid of the mild blackheads around my nose which is why I bought it. I just fought for fifteen minutes to keep the thing on my face, and out of my mouth and eyes. Not worth the fuss.",0
"I have normal with a slightly oily Tzone, it's worse in the summer obviously.  This sets down beautifully without looking flat and matte, which is what I was looking for.  My skin looks natural with a satin finish.",3
"I have not reached for this mask often, however I went to use it today and it is almost as hard as clay! There are at least two full uses left, but I'll have to figure out how to soften it. It says it should last twelve months in a cool dry place. I have only had it about half that time. Pretty annoying. Compared to other masks, even drugstore ones, this has not been a standout. I will not repeat buying.",1
"I haven't found a foundation or power that doesn't make me breakout. I tried a sample and liked it, so I bought the full size. I thought that this would provide ""coverage"" but it doesn't. Even so, it added a nice glow to my face and didn't make me breakout",3
I haven't had a lot of luck with concealers in the past.  They're usually very thick and heavy whether I purchase a store brand or a high end concealer.  I was skeptical about this product but tried it and I was surprised because this product is also a little heavy.  It covered my dark undereye circles and some age spots without using a lot.  My face doesn't feel tight or stiff.  I sweat a lot in the warm weather and this concealer doesn't come off until I am ready for it to come off.  I would definitely buy this again.,3
"I haven't tried all of DE products but this is one that I decided it felt nice in store and was worth spending for full size and also figured my face can finally match my body haha. Regular bronzers like powders are intimidating because I don't use enough makeup regularly for it to look natural. Found the perfect be product to mix in with spf, moisturizer or foundation. Versatile product that doesn't break my oily skin out and I get such a glow. Will repurchase when I run out!",4
"I haven't use a lot of YSL skincare yet but after trying this beautiful serum I will definitely pay more attention to their treatment products. Now to the serum! First of all, the design! It's so sleek, minimalist and stylish. I just love to keep it in my hands. Second, the texture is very lightweight, fast absorbing, silky. Without any oiliness or stickiness. And finally, the first impressions are very positive. I cannot say anything about brightening yet but this product is very soothing and make my skin very soft and smooth. It works well on sensitive areas and makes them more even. I'm looking forward to noticing more visible improvements! \nThe product was received as a free sample.",2
"I haven't used this for long, but I'm already incredibly impressed! The smell and consistency are amazing. A little goes a long way and it sinks in well. I have sensitive, combination skin leaning more toward dry and this keeps my skin super soft and glowy without feeling greasy. From now on this will be my go-to in the Winter and the Pink Juice moisturizer will be my Summer fave. It worked beautifully under my Double Wear foundation, and as a night cream along with their Pineapple serum. I'm really wowed by how much the redness from my acne was reduced. I've yet to be disappointed by anything from Glow Recipe! You will definitely see results from using a complete regimen.I seriously stan.",1
"I have oily, acne prone skin and have used too harsh anti-acne products which left my skin dehydrated, irritated, red, itchy and angry. Even very mild products would make my face sting and burn. I tried this wonderful product and I am so glad I did! Because of the nightmarish state my skin is in, it tingled a little when I first applied it but that feeling didn't last long and a few minutes after my skin felt soothed. It helped reduce redness just like it claims to do within only a few days. It is a bit on the pricy side but it is totally worth it. I will be repurchasing for sure. If you hesitate using this I suggest you try it.",4
"I have oily and acne prone skin. I use this moisturizer during the day. If it's cold outside I'll add rosehip oil for added moisture. This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I don't get breakouts as often. It's very lightweight and it smells amazing. I have been using this for six months. I used one bottle in 4 months, applying it to my face, neck and chest during the day.",0
I have oily and acne prone skin. This product made my skin more oily. I tought it was because my skin needed time to adjust but it didnt improve... Also it made my skin break out a little... My skin was really red after using this and I didnt feel confortable with my face. The smell is really great and the texture also is. I loved the feeling of freshness while washing my face but after it became red... I really wanted to like it but I just stopped using it beacause my skin was getting worse.,0
"I have oily, cystic acne/hormonal acne prone skin. I have always used full coverage high end foundations and about a year ago I just got tired of the caked look and went on a search. I tried the original cc and it was such a greasy mess on my skin, I absolutely hated it. So much that I was reluctant to try this one and past it up many times. On a whim, I got this and it is amazing and night and day different. Perfect for my oily skin! It is great coverage and actually has cleared my skin a bit I think. I use tarte shape tape and the it bye bye redness powder to set and it really stays awesome 12 hours. My oil is a lot less than normal with this too and I only blot once instead of several times. I wish when they did kits they gave you a choice of formulation because oily girls want gift sets too.",1
"I have oily/sensitive skin and I didn't like anything about this. the jelly isn't hydrating enough (and my skin isn't even dry), the pump is kind of messy, and I saw no improvement in my pores or skin texture. I was always reaching for my other moisturizers more so this was not with the money. I used it for 2 weeks before putting it aside and now I'm not sure what to do with it. good concept, poor execution.",0
"I have oily skin and had been suffering from moderate breakouts for about a month when I started using this product. I really like the way it smells and my skin does feel better after a wash, but it did absolutely nothing for my breakouts. If you need a good face wash and don't need acne assistance, I'd recommend. If you are hoping this will help clear up even mild acne, look elsewhere.",4
I have oily skin but I usually mix my night moisturizer with an oil.  During the fall and winter I use it cosmetics moisturizer which is quite heavy for an oily girl.  this is my spring and summer moisturizer. It is light but it gets the job done and my skin feels wonderful in the morning. I also love her SPF.,4
"I have OILY skin, except for under my eyes -- which, on my 29th birthday, became inexplicably dry as a desert.\nAnywho--I absolutely bought this because Katie Jane Hughes, who usually only uses dewy, moisturizing products, highly recommended it. I think it is a perfectly fine (not exceptional, just fine) concealer for spots, or areas on the face needing a little extra coverage, but this looks ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE under my eyes. It looks bad when I set it, it looks bad when I don't set it. It looks bad when I load on eye cream or use the sheerest layer of a hyaluronic acid serum or a dab of a silicon-based primer. It looks terrible on my eyelids under makeup. This concealer creates fine lines where none exist.",0
"I have oily skin so finding mascara can be such a challenge. I've been on this journey to find a mascara that would not smudge for me and so far, I've had no luck.\nThis mascara smudges so so so much under the eyes, even after setting the under eyes with setting powder and setting spray. Had to give it away.",4
"I have oily skin so I dont use oils often but once a week I like do do a facial mask and use a hydrating oil afterwards. I have several so I rotate to see what works best.  This is not it! This oil does not absorb into the skin, it sits there vm even after hours of application. I look like a total grease ball!! This is probably better suited for drier skins.",3
"I have oily skin with occasional breakouts. with larger pores, I'm always really hesitant about wearing foundation, but I was pleasantly surprised with this! got good coverage, without it feeling or looking to bulky on my face. \n\nI also appreciate the range of colours too! I had a lot of options which was good. \n\nmy one con was that there was a LOT of shaking to blend the product before using. it was worth it in the end and it did say to shake before use, but it was still lots of effort to make sure it all blended.",2
"I have oily T-zone and this powder did nothing at oil control. It looked very nice and blurred at first application but after 3 hours it got very oily, there were no traces of the blurring effect, and my T-zone area where I had the product on becomes this oily/patchy mess that seems to be breaking apart with the foundation underneath. I've never had a setting powder that breaks apart my foundation when it's wearing off. Maybe it will be more suitable for people who don't have oily skin.",1
"I have only just started to be concerned about my smile lines so I gave this a try. I used the patches overnight, every other night, for 2 weeks. \nThe lines are definitely less textured, which helps my makeup not settle in and bring more attention to them. The depth of the wrinkles did improve slightly as well. Overall I advise this is a topical treatment, not plastic surgery. My wrinkles are new, and not terribly noticeable to begin with. Results require continued usage layered into my skincare routine.",2
"I have only used this product a few times, but I LOVE IT. it doesn't flake off during the day. more importantly it doesnt irritate my sensitive eyes. It feels super light, like you dont have mascara on at all.",0
"I have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation which means after having a pimple, my skin remains red for weeks or months, but this helps soooo much!! Now, my red spots are gone within a week! I apply 3-4 drops onto my clean skin during the day, followed by my moisturizer. I dont use it at night as I find it reduces the effectiveness of my acne products.",4
I have purchased single beauty blenders for YEARS. Seeing as I have searched every where and haven't found a single person write an honest review hear goes: these holiday sponges ARE NOT the same quality as the non-holiday BB sponges. I bought this set and the sponge felt rough on the face and dragged the product without dispersing it nicely. I am never purchasing another holiday set from BB again. Even though they are listed as being manufactured in the same location in PA the lack of quality makes me believe they are manufactured elsewhere or that they are not made to the same quality standard in order to prepare for the holidays. Save yourself the trouble of becoming a detective and buy the individual high quality ones.,0
"I have purchased these eye patches multiple times because they are the best eye patches I've ever tried. I've used most of patches that are available at Sephora and the drugstore but nothing depuffs and smooths like these from PTR. Yes, it's tough to swallow the price tag but price per patch is much less than any other eye patch.",2
"I have purchased this product before in May during it's launch but received a second mascara complimentary by a company. Getting my second bottle reminded me of why I fell in love with this vegan formula . It's smooth, doesn't sting my eyes and gives me volume and length for days . I get no flaking ! I find you do need to wipe the excess formula on the side of the bottle . A little goes a long way !",0
I have really curly stubborn lashes and allergies with just a few coats I was able to achieve the look of false lashes and still wear my glasses. I cried multiple times throughout the wedding ceremony and had no issues with smudging or running!!!,4
I have really dry skin. just a small amount hydrated my skin. There was no residue or heaviness. I was able to wear it under my make up as well as a primer. it reduced my acne and redness. my face looked smooth all day with out make up.,1
"I have really tricky skin. It's very dry, but foundation has a tendency to separate on my chin. I have lost count how many foundations I've tried - even Laura Mercier Flawless Lumiere (which is beautiful) wasn't hydrating enough!\n\nThis totally did the trick for me! One pump for every day wear, and a second if I want extra coverage. I stipple then blend with a brush, and finish with a dry sponge stipple to make sure it's even.\n\nDefinitely not for everyone (probably not great for oily skin), but this super dry skin gal loves it!",2
I have relatively oily skin with little to no break out. I've only been using it for two weeks but I've already noticed my red spots are less discolored and my pores smaller. I don't mind the sticky feeling because I use an essence and cream afterwards so it's nice and smooth.,1
I have repurchased this product. I actually went through an entire one already. I really really like the very subtle minty flavor. I like that it is sparkly but not a glitter bomb. It can be difficult to get out the product near the end. my old tube still has a bit inside but it doesn't want to get on the applicator easily. I like the applicator though as it does not pull out a clump of product.,2
"I have rosacea, and this has just enough coverage to look and feel natural, neutralizing the red without being cakey or heavy. It has a dewy finish, and I have received compliments on how nice my skin looks when I wear it (which is a big deal for redness sufferers!) Love that it is my SPF and color coverage all in one.",3
"I have said it before, and I'll say it again. do not waste your money on any of the Sephora eyeshadow palettes, they have zero pigmentation.  I am blown away that people give a good review for these products. please save your money",4
"I have seen mixed reviews about this palette but I love it. I purchased on sale, it came intact and just like the other Natasha Denona palettes I've purchased.  At first I thought the colors were too bold for me but I love them. I've never had so many compliments as when I wear this one. It can be applied heavy handed for a bold look or lighter for a more natural look, surprisingly so.",4
I have sensitive and acne prone skin. It has taken me forever to find a routine that really soothes my skin. This lotion after using Murad clarifying cleanser has saved my skin.  This lotion has made my skin super soft and pimple free without making it too oily.,4
"I have sensitive combination skin, and this cleanser does an amazing job of removing makeup/dirt/etc. without stripping my skin or causing any unwanted irritation. I've repurchased 3 times and it'll continue to be my cleanser of choice unless something else  tops it!",0
"I have sensitive skin and am unable to use a lot of eye creams (had to return Le Mer!) This is my newest favorite! It’s not dramatic but moisturizes and settles wrinkles and gives a little glow. Great under concealer, not sticky.",2
"I have sensitive skin with dry cheeks and oily T-zone. After reading a lot about the company and watching videos, I bought this with high expection. It left my face feeling really tight and dry. The price is low, so I didn't even bother to go thru the trouble of returning it.",0
"I have several Natasha Denona palettes both full size and mini, this is hands down my favorite, finally a palette that works on olive skin, every single shade is gorgeous and easy to work with, I was ready to give up on this brand because it was so hit and miss but if they keep cranking out palettes like this I'm sold.",2
"I have several shades of this liquid lip. I love how long lasting these are and that they don't dry down and dry out my lips. However the newer metal shades, and sugar dose specifically, look gorgeous and this shade is perfect for autumn. Unfortunately I don't reach for it because it smells awful, like rancid chemical. It isn't super strong but it's bad enough that I decided to throw it away. I don't think these have an added scent but whatever ingredients they used for the metal have a strong odor. The non-metal shades don't have this odor. This 3 star review is for the metal range only. Formula, color, and longevity are ***** but the scent knocks it down to ***. I hope Sephora expands this shade range in the non-metal line. I would buy out all of the fuschia/magenta colors!",3
"I have short, sparse lashes and even the tiniest false eyelashes look fake on me. I was looking for volume and length and boy does this deliver. Bonus? No bleeding under my eyes. I only wear mascara on the top and this stays put. It comes off with my regular cleanser. LOVE this mascara",3
"I have short, straight lashes and even if I curl my lashes, no mascara can keep them curled. this mascara didn't hold all day but, it's the best I've ever used. it lengthens my lashes and gave them volume and a curl that lasted longer than any other mascara I've tried. I thought the brush was going to be to big for my short lashes but it wasn't at all! I'll be purchasing the full size for sure!",4
"I have silky smooth skin to begin with, this primer really makes my foundation look dewy without setting spray. (Estee Lauder double wear foundation) Honestly wish I would've purchased this instead of my other brand primer.. Thanks sephora for the sample!",0
"I have Skincare and Cosmetic Acquisition Disorder (SCAD), and I've tried different products. There might be help for this concern, but I'm having too much fun to look for a remedy. I have tried scads of cleansers, and I keep coming back to Fresh Soy Cleanser. I am able to remove face and eye makeup with no need for a special eye makeup remover. This cleanser doesn't irritate my eyes and it doesn't dry out my skin. I've used this for years with great success.",2
I have smaller Asian eyes with oily eyelids. I've always thought gel liners look more natural but could never find one that didn't transfer and give me panda eyes. I use Kat Von D liquid liner since it works well for me. I came across this liner recently and it seriously does not budge. It didn't budge either when I was hot and sweaty. Amazing stuff!!,1
"I have sparse, microbladed eyebrows and this does a good job defining the brow with some colour. I like the small brush but if you have thick, bushy brows, this would be a lot of work. Sometimes it can be hard to control or add too much product. It's not bad!",2
"I have spent almost 2 years looking for a foundation that provides a healthy glow & one that doesn't cake up after a few hours on my combination skin. The others claimed to be THAT one, but as soon as I'd be out in the heat, my foundation moved all over - especially around the sides of my nose.. even wearing my sunglasses caused the dreaded shifting! I finally decided to stop avoiding the pricier products & splurged on this foundation, a quality primer & setting powder.. lo and behold FINALLY found that elusive HG combination!! Living in Florida, there's no avoiding the heat or that sheen that's inevitable doing anything outdoors, but this foundation does not budge! It looks as beautiful after an 8-10 hour day as it did when I applied it. I love the glow it provides, which is surprisingly not a problem with my combination skin. Definitely my HG that I will not be straying from. Highly recommend this foundation.. the results are totally worth the extra money!",3
"I have splotches, sometimes, and dark spots and an uneven skin tone. I’m 64 and Asian so my skin quality is pretty good, not too many wrinkles. These products work to get me glowing. Of course, it works best if you also use the 3-step peel on a regular basis. It does make my skin a little bit dry so I always put an extra night crème at night and a moisturising sunscreen for a day. This stuff works for me!",3
"I have struggled to find a moisturizer that is hydrating but not oily.  I am not over the moon about this product, but have repurchased several times, because it is the best solution I have found so far.  I am sensitive to fragrance and my husband even more so, but we both like the scent which never happens with him!  I feel it helps with my fine lines particularly around my eye area.  It never has caused any irritation or clogging of my pores.",2
"I have struggled with puffiness my entire life and this cream removed my dark circles and puffiness within a few days! it is so light for the skin so it doesn't feel heavy. I think this is better for those of us with younger skin, as it isn't heavy duty but overall I've been thoroughly impressed. I bought another one recommended to last longer and also help protect against aging and it pales in comparison. Definitely a great find",4
"I have stubborn short lashes. They naturally don't curl up. I also have a difficult time keeping my lashes curled even after curling them and applying mascara. I work for long hours and applying false lashes daily is just no reasonable. This mascara however has been the only one that keeps my short lashes curled after curling them. Just what I need. it also does not smudge and lasts all day! I have tried several including better than sex, Mac, Tarte, and other Over the counter and this one tops them all! To believe it started with a sample. I have bought this over and over since.",1
"I have sunken in under eye bags that always cast blue and purple, due to my under eyes being this way every concealer or corrector I've used either creased badly, wasn't bright enough, very thick or let the blue hues come through. This product has changed my whole under eye problem for the better. My under eyes never looked as bright and well rested. This product doesn't crease on me and the shade works great on it's own, I dont apply concealer on top of this as it works well for me. A little goes a long way. I used this product with the Laura Mercier Under eye brightening powder in my routine everyday and could not be happier with how my eyes look.",0
I have super oily skin that usually gets very slick and shiny within an hour of putting on my makeup. I used this translucent #12 loose powder on top of my makeup forever HD liquid foundation and it really controlled the shine and set my foundation in place. Several hours later my face was still very matte with only a slight sheen on my nose. Works better than any other loose powder I have tried yet,4
"I have tan-deep skin (nars Tahoe, fenty 350) and the highlighter looks beautiful on me. Sunkissed only works as a blush and is also great. Unfortunately I can't use Sweet Peach Peony because it's way too light and that's the reason this gets 3 stars.",1
"I have the charcoal one and I love it. After two years, it's like new, comfortable, and blocks all light. It's sooo soft. I wear it almost every night (I skip it when I have to get up early) and it's holding up well. Def recommend. Worth the price.",3
"I have the oiliest skin in the univerise and having heard good reviews from ssssamanthaa, I was quick to give this a shot. Sadly, it's not match for my extremely oily skin. Honestly, the best primer I've ever used is Milani.",1
"I have the two four pan palettes and the single (Disco) and have been using them since June. I love the shimmer but there can be pretty bad fallout with all the shades. It is a unique formula that I have found so far works best applied with a finger. I do find it interesting that many of the rave, glowing five star reviews for these products are coming from newbies whose only reviews are for Roen. Folks, don't be so obvious about trying to seed positive reviews for your products - maybe let people try them and then let the products speak for themselves?",3
I have the worse issue with mascara. Doesn't matter if it's waterproof or not I always somehow rubbed it all over my eyes. BUT I was sooo surprised with this primer! Keeps the mascara on all day. Simply the best.  I can finally wear mascara!,1
"I have thinning, fine hair. I have used many products over these last few years to help hide my scalp and bulk up what is left of my hair. This product does that! I can even skip an occasional day of shampooing, as it  keeps my hair from looking oily and flat. It says to use on a clean dry scalp, I use it on my clean, fresh from the shower damp scalp. This along with  Alterna Anti aging Volumizing spray has gotten me SO many comments on how nice my hair looks. It feels thicker too, even my hair dresser commented. It is a great product for a very good price!",3
"I have this in a few shades, but Au Naturel and Vanilla Kiss are my everyday go-tos. I have oily skin and oily lids, but I don't use a primer with this shadow. Au Natural goes on my lid and Vanilla Kiss under the brow. I use a flat, stiff brush to blend out the edges and I'm done. Stays all day, doesn't change colors, and gives my eye area a brighter (but not shimmery) glow. I'm 59 and I don't have time for contouring. I just want a quick routine that gets me out the door, and these shadow sticks are must-haves for me. Worth the money!",3
"I have this in both Orange Fizz and Sangria Slush, but Orange Fizz is my fave of the two (what I'm wearing in the photo). It's a bright coral-orange red on me that turns into a bright pink but I love that it's still bright enough that you don't see it fading so reapplying isn't needed, unless you're like me and to punch up the orange-red again. Sangria slush is more of a true red but doesn't fade as evenly, and although I like the color, it still wears more like a regular lipstick. Don't get me wrong, though - these stains will last til the next day no matter how powerful your makeup remover, lol. I'd love to see them come out with a bright fuchsia-purple!\n\nAlso - prepare to pick up some whitening strips with these since the shades kinda bring out the yellow in your teeth.",0
I have this in boy collector and catwalk killa and they are my new favorite lipsticks bc you can put them on really light and use gloss over the top or put them on heavier for a bolder look and they aren't drying or gooey and they stay on a while w/o having to reapply.,2
"I have to admit that it has been quite some time since I wore fake lashes. I’ve almost perfected my natural lashes and haven’t a need for the fake kind. With that being said, these lashes are incredibly light, natural feeling and fresh. \nI trimmed maybe 1/3 off of these lashes but still had trouble applying them. The glue That came with them was tacky as expected And did not leave a mess, I just struggled to get them on before I needed to get out the door. I look forward to learning to perfect this look too.",0
"I have to admit this goes on with the most luxurious feel to it. its velvety, creamy, and highly moisturising, and honestly made my make up look fantastic!  So if you dont have sensitive skin or challenges with acne then this is for you. BUT if you do have those challenges... unfortunately you cannot use this more than once in a week. Using this daily clogged my pores and I suffered some minor breakouts. I suggest finding something else.",2
"I have to assume that the bad reviews come from the people that didn't need this product to begin with, because they perform beautifully on myself (45) and worked a miracle on my Mother (68). If your under eye is aged, this is what you want love.",4
"I have to say I am actually loving this foundation. when I first looked at the color I thought it was way to light. but then I applied it to my skin and it blended perfectly with my skintone. it looked so natural you couldn't even tell I had on foundation. then I noticed how light it felt on I will say it gave me a mediumish cover.   it's comfortable, wears well and doesn't have that sickening scent that dior foundation tends to have and I'm grateful for that, because I wasn't able to handle the smell.  so all in all I'm impressed. now I will let you know I did receive the foundation as a free sample to try. however that in no way influences me or my opinion on the product.",4
I have to say this was a pretty good box. I absolutely love the Clinique lippy and in fact that's why I got it. The reason I gave him only three stars is because I don't know why supplements are in there and the lip gloss in that little packaging is really hard to use.,0
"I have tried all of these.  The color payoff is zero, it quiet literally disappears on the skin.  I have extremely fair skin, for reference, I am PatMcgraths foundation 01.  This literally does not show up on my skin at all ""she's sincere"".  I heavily layered it, I used brushes and my fingers, it won't swatch and it wont go on the cheeks.  If you're someone who heavily overuses blush, you're gonna have to heavily dip your brush into this power and apply about 5-6 times before having any color show up, and it's seriously barely there by then.  It's seriously that bad of a color payoff. This is not ""a natural"" or ""minimalist"" blush, this is just zero pigmentation period.  The other blushes still take about four, HEAVY dips into the pan and layering to show anything.  It's a serious shame because I have really loved all other PatrickTA products until this.  It's a great concept, I adore the packaging and the colors inside the pan, but it should have more color payoff than this.  Like seriously, I am an extremely light shade, good luck to anyone with a darker complextion trying to get this to show up.  This is a complete waste, you're going to be hitting pan and running out of this blush far faster than any other blush because of the amount of times and heavy dips it takes to show up.",0
"I have tried a lot of drunk elephant products, and as much as people love them they have never really worked for my skin type. I have super sensitive, acne prone skin, but after much research I decided to give this a try. I absoultely love this product! It hydrates my eyes so well, and I usually get pretty dry under my eyes and this really does the job. I use it morning and night, highly reccommend.",0
I have tried another Caudalie toner but felt it dried out my skin too much so I tried this one thinking it would be gentler.  Instead it gives me  very noticeable redness in the cheek areas and bumps.  I will never purchase another Caudalie product ever!,2
"I have tried a number of eye gels and creams, but have not found one does the trick. Either not moisturizing enough, too sticky, cause milia, too oily. The Origins formula is creamy enough yet gets absorbed quickly enough. I have been using for a month. It has a small depuffing effect, and makes the dark circles appear a little brighter. Definitely liking it.",4
"I have tried everything for my maturing, dry, large pore,red skin! everytging was patchy, cakey, drying, or came right off but This is phenomenal!!! I use a combo of this and the stick in shell and everyone compliments my complexion!! it also has the ability to be a full coverage! I also use cover fx dewy primer and setting spray and I swear (I have MS and sweat A LOT) it stays put for at least 12 hours. get a sample asap!!",4
"I have tried EVERYTHING. My skin would be cracking and dry, but then break out in other spots and be oily. It made no sense.  This miracle cream cleared up the excess acne, reduced oil production in problem spots, and healed cracked cracked skin.  It moisturizes, but somehow my skin no longer looks or feels oily. I feel fresh all day.  It has been Heaven sent. I never knew I needed it until I received a sample. I wish those were available for purchase so everyone could try it, and see why it is worth every penny.  (I'm in my 30's)",1
"I have tried just about every foundation; liquid, cream, powder...  I love this foundation.  I have oily skin and no other foundation I've tried in the past 30 years gave me oil free skin through an entire day.  I maybe only have to blot about once a day now.  It is the perfect coverage for me.  Not too light, not too heavy.  Looks very natural and dewy.  No caking or drying or filling up small wrinkles.  I have medium color skin and the mid color matches wonderfully.  YOU MUST APPLY THIS FOUNDATION WITH YOUR FINGERS.  I actually love putting my foundation on this way now.  Also, no more washing brushes, sponges or feeling guilty for throwing away disposable sponges.",4
"I have tried just about everything from drug store to higher end products and this Trump's them ALL! I hope milk never ever gets rid of this one. I have dry skin and have always found it difficult to use a foundation that doesn't highlight dry patches and isn't too cakey. this foundation definitely does not do that. not only that, it is the EXACT color it my skin tone. to the t. it's super light weight but buildable. extremely natural looking and literally looks like your skin! I love this!! it also has improved my skin health, it doesn't make me breakout and it never dries out towards the end of the day. I can use this with both their primers and set it with their powder and it looks effing amazing! even after powder it looks sheer. stays on all day. please buy this! it'll change your makeup game! ❤️",1
"I have tried many different types of moisturizers, but this is one of the few I will go out of my way to find. it's one of the best things I have found for both my face and body. I just wish that they made it in quart size bottles.",4
"I have tried many different versions of Hyaluronic Acid serum. Some are thick, some are sticky & some are unpleasant. The Inkey List's version is so light & feels clean when you apply it to your skin. It feels like a cool drink of water for your complexion. It is not sticky & it does not leave a residue. I recommend this product & I believe it is good for all skin types.",3
"I have tried several different products claiming to refresh or resurface but this one is the best!  I use it every other day or less depending on how my skin looks - which is amazing lately! My skin can be sensitive and dry but this does not cause any issues.  There is a slight tingle when you apply it but that's it.  My concerns are unevenness, dark spots and fine lines - this has greatly improved all 3 very quickly!  It is now a permanent part of my skin care regime!",2
"I have tried several different types of Vitamin C serums, never seeing any results at all but this product is just lovely and within days my skin was looking radiant. I have pretty sensitive skin also and haven't had the least bit of irritation.",2
I have tried several magnetic eyelashes and nothing compares to these. They are so easy to put on and they stay on all day. It definitely beats putting on falsies with glue and sitting in a chair for hours to have them attached to my lashes (not to mention much cheaper). :),2
"I have tried several primers and they seem to be the same until I tried Ciate. I read the reviews and thought why not. This is so different than anything else that I have tried. You get a refreshing wake me up scent. It goes on wet and easy to spread on the face and then dries very quickly and gives you a nice matte finish. Everything else that I put on after (concealer, foundation, etc.) just glides on and stays put. I don't have to use as much blush because it sticks to my face. I even use this a primer for my lips. This has a very different feel and result like nothing I have every tried before. This is so unique. I just love this. This is my forever primer.",3
"I have tried several samples and currently have a travel sized tube. I really like it for it's moisturizing properties and find that it does help calm my skin, especially post-microneedling and using a high potency alpha and beta hydroxy mask. I took one star away because while I am satisfied with the product, I am still going to continue my search for one I really love. I can see keeping it in my rotation for use after microneedling though.",4
"I have tried so many different tinted moisturizers and bb creams trying to find something to even out my skin tone and give me that no makeup look but they all either have too much coverage and make me look too ""made up"" or look orange on my pale skin. I got this in my sephora play box and instantly fell in love! It blends so nicely and looks so natural.... I just put a bit of Glossier Cloud Paint over top on my cheeks and am good to go. Best product ever!!",1
"I have tried so many eye creams from cheap drugstore to natural and not so natural. This is the best so far that I have tried. It is moisturizing, de-puffing,and yet firming. My biggest eye problem is eye puffiness in the morning and this cream is really helping. Now, I don't look as if I've been on a tear and also ate 2lbs of potato chips.",3
"I have tried SO MANY mascaras in the last year trying to find THE ONE. Big brushes, little brushes, you name it. This one? Its perfect. Its MY HG. Glad the mini sizes are available so I'm not wasting money trying full size and hating them.\n\nI did not expect to like this one, as I haven't found one that I've loved, even previous 'loves' from years ago aren't the same or I have different demands than I used to. \n\nHighly recommend trying it!",1
I have tried these serveral times and they just look chalky. They however; swatch really pretty they just dont look good on the skin. The powderiness emphasizes texture and makes my skin look very dry.,0
I have tried this mascara several times and each time I have ended up with lashes that were a clumpy mess- even after wiping the excess off of the applicator. It also smudged and smeared within a couple hours of applying it. This absolutely didn't work for me. I am so glad that I didn't purchase the full size.,3
"I have tried tons of primers, Smashbox, Armani, Benefit pore one, Dr. Brandt pore one, FAB, I can go on and on. This one wins and blows the rest of them  away. I got a sample and tried it today. I do not have huge pores, but  have some that appeared as another joke for us maturing ladies, this primer blurs them out of existence. I actually went and cleaned off my glasses to look again. I used it under my Chanel Vitalumiere and there was no piling, balling up or anything like that. Just a great looking finish after my hourglass mood light powder. I am not a fan of matte anything, and was so happy that it didn't give me that flat look. I just signed up to be notified when it is back in stock to get the full size.",3
I have tried to stray from this concealer and always regret it. The finish and coverage is unmatched. The color/shade undertone is impossible to find for darker complexions in other brands of concealer. I will remain faithful till the end of time.,0
"I have two other BKR water bottles, one teeny (250 ml) and one little (500 ml), I just ordered this bottle because I wanted the larger size and have been wanting a spiked sleeve.\n\nBKR makes great water bottles that you will not lose or leave behind because you will love carrying them. I like my water cold so I ordered ice trays from BKR which makes cubes small enough to fit through the opening.\n\nGreat, healthy, environmentally sound product.",3
"I have used a lot of powders over the past 40 years. As my face began to mature and dry out, I was having trouble finding satisfaction with the powders I was trying after my old powder just didn't work anymore.  This is soft, doesn't settle into lines, and just feels good. A fun, albeit weird, side effect is the subtle taste of peach as the powder drifts into my mouth.",4
"I have used a multitude eye creams I just tried BRIGHTEYES from GLAMGLOW and it is now one of my favorites! When I use it my eyes look brighter, fine lines are minimized and I appear rested. The texture of the cream is light and my concealer goes on smoothly. During the day if I want to give myself a refreshed look I put a little cream on my fingers rub them together and lightly tap under my eyes. I will be purchasing this eye cream again!",3
I have used BB for years and have gone threw a ton of them. I bought this to replace my old one and found that it doesn't absorb as well when you wet it. It doesn't swell as big as all my others and it's harder to use. something feels off about the one I received.,1
I have used Lancome mascaras for 30  years. Why? They don't flake. As a contact lens wearer that's the most important quality in a mascara. Also don't smudge. This specific mascara adds volume and length. Great mascara.,3
"I have used many foundations until now, but this is the best one I have used so far. It flows with my skin so well, it looks so natural, and my face looks flawless as well as spotless!! I am so happy I found my color and I will definitely restock!",0
"I have used other , more expensive , powders like this. The price of this made me switch brands.\nNow that I’ve been using it, I really like it! The transparent has no color, just a very light, finely milled powder. So soft on skin!\nI keep in my purse, in case I need more SPF later in the day. Not chalky.",3
"I have used retinol religiously for the past year and have seen zero changes in my skin. I decided to swap that in for this product. One week of use and I am blown away at the changes I already see. My skin looks smoother and my pores less noticable. If retinol products are not working for you, give this a try.",2
"I have used so many under eye correctors and primers and this one is a knock out. I've used it only for two days and can say my concealer has never worn better throughout the day . I have dry under eyes which can look a bit crepey after a day of wearing concealer. With this on, makeup was worn throughout the day and still looked incredible. It feels super creamy and soft to the touch. No tugging on the skin. It's worth a shot if you have dry under eyes! So good!",2
"I have used the Bite lip mask prior to trying this in the Treat yourself set and it smells like a creamsicle or orange julius (and it's cheaper and a more efficient overnight lip mask than the mask, which I find makes a better lip gloss.",4
"I have used the Clear Improvement mask for over a decade and was excited to try this product. I've noticed a distinct difference in the clarity of my skin, and even though it's in the middle of summer, I'm breaking out less frequently. I like that it has a matte finish too, it feels weightless under makeup.",0
I have used these masks as preparation before putting on my make up for a big night out. It wakes up the skin and makes a day's worth of tiredness go away in 20 minutes! Definitely worth the purchase. Will repurchase again when the next needed!,1
"I have used this for the past 2 years and love it.  It doesn’t break out my sensitive, acneic skin, and it doesn’t dry it out.  I’m visiting in Louisville right now and both Sephoras say they don’t have any b/c it’s being discontinued or reformulated.  Don’t discontinue it and don’t change it!   Geez.",2
"I have used this kit for a full year and love it. Just about everything you need is included, I do suggest buying a travel size nail file (flat type) to store inside and there ya go - all set! I keep mine in my purse because I have brittle nails and am very hands on so always need a clip or file on hand. Great kit for yourself or to gift!",2
I have very dry patches on my face and oily spots everywhere else. I've been using this serum along with the Original moisturizer twice a day and I have seen some improvement in just a week. the dry patches aren't flaking any longer! This item is on my repeat purchase list for sure.\n\noh and the price is awesome!,2
I have very dry skin. This makes my under eyes look amazing. I also use it all over my face. Only down side is that you dont get a lot of product for the price. I find myself going back to my laura mercier and saving this for my very dry skin days.,1
"I have very fair skin, and the darkness under my eyes has been an issue for as long as I can remember. I started wearing makeup at age 12 to mask it, and have tried pretty much everything over the years. This is the only thing that really works for me. Other products end up looking chalky or like I'm obviously wearing makeup. This appears more natural and has saved me so much time. Honestly, if I wear any makeup at all, it's just coverup under my eyes. Using this product alone, I can easily cover my dark under eye circles and blemishes, then curl my eyelashes and I'm done!  I hope they never discontinue it!",2
"I have very large pores around my cheeks and nose and noticed an immediate improvement in the size of my pores. the effects lasted a couple of days. I'm going to start using this mask once a week to see if the effects are cumulative.  feels great on, doesn't slide around and easy to use!",3
"I have very oily and very dry combination skin, with a persistent shiny forehead, large pores, and occasional acne. (Whew!) After using this for a month, my pores are noticeably smaller, my acne has chilled out, and my skin doesn't seem to get as dry as before. \n\nIt's not perfect - the texture is a bit sticky, and on humid days the feeling stays around. I was also hoping it would help with my shininess, but I haven't noticed any changes with that.",1
I have very sensitive and picky skin and grabbed this product because I was struggling with subcutaneous bumps all over my face. It has been a total game changer and really helped decongest my skin. I have dry skin and found that this product is fine. sometimes I leave it on as a spot treatment,1
"I have very sensitive, dry reactive skin. I wear full coverage makeup everyday at work and my pores get clogged easily. I use an oil cleanser first, then apply a second cleanser (usually tatcha rice powder) and use the Foreo to scrub everything clean. I noticed that with continued nightly use, my breakouts are much much fewer than they were before. I went on vacation and lost my little Foreo, and almost immediately my breakouts came back. If you have sensitive skin prone to breakouts, this is a wonderful device to add into your routine. It isn't abrasive or painful, it's very easy to use and gentle. My first device I had for a full year without any issues. Hopefully I don't lose this one!!",1
"I have very sensitive skin and break out if I don't use the perfect cleanser. My skin feels oily and dry at the same time, and this is the only one that didn't irritate it. I use it with a foreo, and I hardly ever break out!",1
"I have very sensitive skin in my 40's. I have tried many primers which either leave my face greasy or breakout which makes my makeup looking awful. I love the way it looks on my face with or without makeup. I also have noticed my skin doesn't look red, my dark spots and dark circles are not as noticeable. It just gives me a bit of a glow. Plus I have been combing it with her Anti-pollution serum. I am crossing my fingers that this one is a keeper..",3
"I have very sensitive skin with rosacea.  It can be very reactive.  The last few days it has itched, burned, and red.  Nothing would calm it completely.  Finally, after using a sample of the Ren Evercalm Recovery Mask I got from Sephora yesterday followed by this Overnight Recovery Balm, my skin is calm.  A true lifesaver for me!",3
"I have very sparse and thin eyebrows.  This is a quick and easy to use pencil that gives a natural look. The shape of the pencil makes it easy to control the thickness and intensity of the color.  I will continue to repurchase, however, I really wish the company would fix the issue with the cap on the brush falling off.  This hasn't happened on every IT Cosmetics brow pencil that I've purchased, but this is the 2nd one I've gotten where the cap does fall off all the time in my makeup bag that I carry daily.  It's annoying and makes it difficult to keep the brush clean from other makeup bag debris while on the go.",3
"I have VERY watery eyes due to constant allergies, and this mascara holds up. However, I've had drugstore mascaras that hold up just as good, but this is the only mascara that does not make my eyes itch and swell more than normal. Before this mascara, I could not stand putting on mascara every day due to this. Although I wish it held the curl longer and be less clumpy, I really like this mascara since thanks to this product I can wear eye makeup how many times I want without the worry of my eyes turning bright red and extremely swollen.",0
"I have wanted the Lila palette but couldn't commit to the price, this mini seemed like a way for me to have my cake and eat it too. I wasn't sure if I would use all of the non-brown tones (thanks hooded eyes!) but I feel confident enough to use only this palette to create flattering and fun eyelooks. I haven't experienced fallout, patchiness, and the colors blend beautifully. Now I feel like I must buy the full size Lila!",4
"I have weird lashes. They are short, perfectly straight on the left side, and super curly on the right side. Putting on mascara can be a nightmare. It will look nice on one eye and a clumpy mess on the other. \nWith that being said, this mascara works perfectly for me. The formula is wet and it’s one of those comb style brushes. I didn’t find the brush hard to use or the formula messy. It went on beautifully. It definitely lengthened my lashes, and the color pay off was great. It’s such a pretty black. I had no problem applying this to the curly side of my lashes either. There was no clumping, and it separated them also. It stayed put for hours without flaking or smudging. I highly recommend this mascara. Trust me, I have tried everything out there, and this preforms exactly how a mascara should.",2
I have yet to be disappointed by ABH and this setting powder is no exception. I usually switch between Laura Mercier and Hourglass setting powders and while both LM and Hourglass powders were finer and silkier I found the ABH powder to work better with my oily skin. It didn't make my concealer cake under my eyes and gave me a mattifying finish for the night.,1
I have yet to figure out how to best use this . I can’t understand all the five star reviews. I find it goes on thick. As mentioned like butter. I do not like my face looking like it has been painted gold. My goal was to get a shimmery look. I’ve yet to discover how to use this product. I based my purchase on other reviews. Just not for me.,3
"I hesitate buying this since I have had acid peel facials in the past and those are intense. Even though 7% is not nearly as much as getting a peel, I was still a bit scared. However, I don't really like using physical exfoliants since the smoothness afterwards only lasts so long. I bought this just to try it since the price point and reviews are great.\n\nNeedless to say I like this product! I use this at night, and sometimes with 2% salicylic acid, and it does a great job in keeping my skin smooth for the whole day (and starting off my day with a smooth canvas) keeping the cystic acne away. I also used this every other day at first since I wanted to ease myself in using this.\n\nI do also use sparingly on my cotton round and it is enough to cover my face and neck. You don't need much.",2
I he usually go for something more pink. but I wanted to try this because I wanted to get away from powders to see if they would make my more mature skin look better. and it definitely makes my skin look fabulous. it looks very natural it and blends beautifully.,4
"I highly suggest swatching these in person instead of buying blindly online.  A lot of colors swatch very different in real life.  Some of these palettes are safer, like number 5 is a safe bet (or number 4 which is like it's darker complextion sister).  Other palettes are a giant gamble, like number 7.  The grey and the yellow do not show up as the color you think it should.  The gray is much more ""murky"" in a very bad way, the yellow is ""dusty"".  Number 6 is quiet dark for all the mattes, it just ends up a bit murky too.  I find that all the mattes are really powdery, they don't go on super smooth, but it isn't the end of the world to work with. There's a lot of fallout.  Also, these palettes are quiet small, but that's point, it's meant for travel and these are very travel friendly.  I think that's the biggest selling point here, the travel-friendly aspect.  The shimmers are more safe, except for in palette number 8, the shimmers in there are not as pigmented as they could be (I mean, compare it to her kilowatt highlighters/duos! those have so much more pigmentation and way better quality of shadows).  I personally would not suggest buying these palettes unless you plan to use it as your ""to-go"" palette to touch up at work or do makeup on the go or traveling.  I docked only one star because honestly, just go in store to swatch first, you may end up being just fine with the color and fallout, plus the travel aspect is really solid.",0
"I honestly didn't see any change. I have dark circles under my eyes and even with the creamy and brightening qualities it says on the box, I don't see any improvement, after having emptied the pot. Waste of money.",4
"I honestly don't get the hype around this product. I tried so many different things and techniques to get this to work and failed each time. I alternate between 3 different foundations: Pur, Lancome, and Estee Lauder and this product made each of them crack, shift, transfer, and look like patchy, greasy, embarrassing messes. It was so bad, I rubbed as much of my makeup off as I could at work and looked 100% better. Ridiculous price for an overhyped disaster.",3
"I honestly don't know how others are reviewing this so high. I always brush off the brush a bit on the neck of the bottle to get rid of any excess mascara and BOY does this have excess. I brush off so much only to have so much still on. Maybe that's why my lashes don't stay curled. They get CRAZY clumpy and heavy. I'll see if it improves over time, but to me this is a major flop. I miss my Dior mascara with a plump brush and the perfect amount of mascara.",0
"I honestly love these lip crayon! It isn't too thick or thin and glides on smoothly.  It isn't long lasting like other lip liners, but I will still give it a 5 because it lines perfectly.  Other lip liners, I feel like I need to glide over and over to get a perfect line.  Plus the formula feels nice and smooth.",4
"I honestly LOVE this lipstick. it is so unbelievably creamy and long lasting. it lasted through a large coffee at McDonald's and a can of soda even. and, it STILL ON!! It lasted through a whole chicken salad with loads of ranch and a cheeseburger. It most certainly proved its self. I usually dont like lipstick cause I find them messy. But if you use a lip liner (which i do recommend cause of the creaminess of the lipstcik) it stays put. and it looks amazing for any occasion!!! honestly please try this lipstick! you wont be disappointed.",0
"I honestly wasnt expecting much from this line, as the majority of sephora owned products are a bust, but I can say without a doubt this is the best moisturizer I've ever used. I have a lot of experience in skincare, and I've tried many high end ($60-$120) moisturizers but nothing has worked as well as this. I have dry, dehydrated skin and it is a perfect formula, as it is almost whipped in texture making it lightweight but still ""thick"" (it isn't heavy at all) moisturizer for both summer and winter. the fragrance in minimal, it smells very clean and fresh, but not overwhelmingly so. Most importantly, it's very very good as a base for other products. my serums, ampoules, gels and oils layer perfectly over the product. Never again will I waste needless money on high end products to do 1/10th of a job this one does.",0
"I hope they never stop making this. I originally bought this peach corrector for my under eye circles, but it doubles as a concealer for around my nose or any spots on my face. I already use an under eye concealer, and I can put this on top of it & pat it in with a brush or beauty blender. \n\nI have a bit of darkness above my lips due to past Minocycline use and this helps hide it. It never creases & lasts a long time. For reference I wear Mac C5 powder foundation. I used to be much cooler but tanning has made my skin more neutral, even peachy. This also lasts a long time. For years, I'd never use a wand because I was afraid of introducing bacteria, but I've never had a problem & this has never caused me to break it.",2
I hope this full size to replace my now empty pans in the Ambient edit pallet. I love this powder so much for a quick all over face powder. It really adds a beautiful glow from within and makes me skin look so smooth!,1
"I ignored the negative reviews of this shade because I wanted so much for it to work, but it just doesn't.  The green itself is beautiful, but the formula just doesn't seem to apply well, no matter what I try.  The felt applicator doesn't blend and any other attempt using my finger or any brushes just picks the product back up.   Lighter shades are probably more forgiving.  I would be satisfied if I could get the color to apply opaquely, but I can't figure out how to do that, either.  Two stars because I haven't given up on the lovely color and at least it was inexpensive.",3
I immediately picked this up as the Sephora I visited started carrying more Natasha Denona. Could not be more please. Yes you can wear this alone but it will be sheer. I love adding it on top of an eyeshadow for a little extra something something. It is new to me and just to be safe I do store in a drawer to help prolong its life. I have had NO drying up issues but I thought better be safe. Very pretty color with a purple/pink shift. Lovely!!,4
"I incorporated this eye cream into my night routine and saw results. After washing my face and then using toner I began to also use the eye cream. In the morning my eyes were not as puffy as usual. In addition to looking better in the mornings, I also felt better. My eyebags didn't feel as heavy but instead felt tighter.\xa0 Although the overall results are not immediate, I imagine the longer the use the better the results will be. So far, I am continuing to use this eye cream.\n\n\n\xa0I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes",4
"I initially bought this because it had a good review from one of my fav makeup youtubers. I wanted to try to see if it will really hold up and not crease with my combo skin. Sadly, it didn't. I've been using it for 2 days now and still the same results. It doesn't sit well on my skin and my face became an oily mess. I tried to set it with powder to no avail. I didn't use a primer and just had moisturizer and sunscreen (which is my usual routine) and used a sponge to apply the foundation. The only one that has worked well with me and holds up for 8 hours or longer is the TooFaced Peach Perfect---I think I will stick to it for now until I find a much better alternative.",4
I initially bought this to occasionally use instead of my concealer because it was supposed to be an eye cream and better for yoir eyes but I did not expect it to have as nearly good coverage.\nWhen I tried it I was pleasantly surprised that it has a great coverage. A tiny bit goes a long way and now that's all I use. If it is better for my eyes too then what else would I want from it? :),1
I initially got it as a sample and loved it! i'm now at my third full size. I like it because i already have long eyelashes so i'm not looking for length in my mascaras. this one really gives volume to my lashes without being clumpy. it's my favourite mascara i ever had,0
"I initially loved this spray. I tried it on in the store and needed to have it, but smelled so amazing. Although when I began to wear it on the daily, I noticed that the scent would disappear within 30 min or so...I also noticed that the scent would sometimes go from a lovely scent to then smelling like a chemical scent mixed with vanilla, not really the ideal scent I was go for. I had high hopes for this spray.",4
"I initially purchased the travel duo set in the travel case and enjoy using them both. I use the white bar in the morning and the JuJu bar at night. I liked the JuJu bar so much that I purchased this full-size one to leave in my shower to use nightly. However, for the price and the size, I'm not sure if I'll repurchase it. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, which is always a plus with any product. My skin is left feeling clean and moisturized.",2
"I initially swatched these in store and was not into them, but ended up purchasing a couple online and have changed my mind! The colors I ended up with are Dusk and Orchid. They both are smooth and moisturizing with great pigmentation. Although not the longest lasting, I'm pleased with the comfort of these lipsticks. For the darker shades I would suggest using a mirror to apply/reapply as the are so pigmented. I wish they were a bit less expensive, but the product and packaging certainly justify the price tag.",0
I just bought this a week ago and this product keeps balling up on me and peeling on my skin. This is the WORST product ever. it can't work with other products layered. Glad this was cheap I don't feel bad throwing it away.,3
"I just bought this hoping that it will remove or at least lighten some of the freckles I have under my eyes and temples.  I don't have many, but I see them.  So far, I can say that it hasn't irritated my skin.  I use it every night and my skin has not become sensitive in the areas.  I have been using it for about a week or two.  No visible changes yet, but it may be too soon I will keep using it and hopefully, it will lighten the spots.",3
"I just don't feel like this did a ton. I used mine after cleansing in the morning and like, it didn't feel like it was getting the gunk out of my pores or anything else really.\n\nIt gets an extra star because it didn't do anything bad to my skin and it was fun when it tingled a bit.\n\nI got this as part of the pack with the glowstarter so it was a much better deal at the time.",1
"I just got a trial size of this. it hasn't even been five minutes since I used it and I already love it. my face has never been this smooth, and I always struggle with little patches of stubborn dry skin. I will be purchasing a full size ASAP.",0
"I just got in the mail today, I just used it for the first time and I like that you can customize it right from your phone. All the different intensities and you can use it without the app too which of course I like. I haven't used the tarte products yet but I have had the luna mini 2 before and this is definitely a upgrade!",1
I just got this and I've been using it straight for about two weeks and I'm already seeing results! the texture around the highlight of my cheeks is less noticable! your skin feels so nice afterwards and you can just feel the clean!  I saw Desi Perkins recommend it so I decided to try and I'm so glad I did! I just got some other stuff from their brand I'm very pleased so far :),4
"I just got this product last month. I like to try new things, when i first tried tgis product is was with a beauty blender and i loves the finishing look of it, i wouldnt have changed a thing i loved the dewyness and how over all applied the coverage is beautiful and i have combo skin mostly oily on my nose but the rest of my face is dry. this product IMO is also beautiful and flawless with a Brush. i use my smashbox kabuki and again loved the outcome. would i recomened yes, do i add my own concealer on top, yes i do because i love alittle bit of a brighter under eye. It has a neat bottle make as theres a locking mechanism when opening to pump out product, safe for travel as well. I hope this healps have a beautiful Day :D",0
"I JUST got this, so will update if my mind changes, but this pairs SO well with my nightly routine of the soy cleanser, rose toner and dream cream night recovery. In just a week, my skin has gone from uncomfortably dry and tight to supple and smooth. It isn’t too heavy, but feels substantially moisturizing and does a nice job sinking into the skin without leaving a heavy layer.",1
"I just love it!! my skin is really oily and after +15years of using the same skincare brand, I decided to switch to this one and for the first time in a long time I feel my skin under control. I would definetly keep using it.",2
I just love this toner. I love that it's a spray and has a nice fresh scent to it. It feels so good on my face and removes residue that I can see on the cotton pad after wiping my face. No sticky feeling! I love Indie Lee products! I'm re-ordering another one!,2
I just purchased this bc so beautiful. I like it especially the Blues\n I took off one star bc the colors seem to fade on me even over primer. The other reason is the Blues are a little gritty which is ok but some of the eye shadow flecked in my eye twice today and caused me discomfort. So is this beautiful yes. I have to be careful using it tho.,3
I just received in the mail today and opened the box and there was glitter everywhere.opened up the palette and there was shade C2 chunks everywhere got all over my pants and hands. it's so soft I can't really press it back in. I bought the palette for the unique greens. sucks my new palette is broken. I know glitter greens are hard to produce but come on ABH. Sephora can I get a new one? hopefully the colors work great and I'm the only one who s is too soft.,4
"I just received this in my December Play! Box, and am really enjoying it. It feels nice moisturizing on my lips, and the hint of color is great for ""low maintenance"" days. I am thinking about purchasing the Nude in a larger tube along with another shade. Lips feel slick but not goopy. It was nice to receive something that wasn't even on my radar!",4
"I JUST RECEIVED THIS PALLET, an was So HAPPY SEPHORA had it in stock!!!! The Pat McGrath website had ran out of this particular pallet!!!(They did reimburse me though!) So I JUST KNEW TO GO TO SEPHORA!!! And Thanks to them, My COLLECTION is COMPLETE!!! Now about the actual pallet, I'm Not IMPRESSED with, for some reason its Chalky when applying, and it takes 3 swipes to get actual pigment, ESPECIALLY the Purple!!! (However Purple's are VERY HARD TO MAKE THEY SAY!) But Even the GOLD didnt impress me!!! and she does Golds so Nicely But this ones a FLOP!!! VERY MUTED!!! NO SHINE like with most of her Golds!!! Blue is BEAUTIFUL!!! NO COMPLAINTS HERE !!! All in all, I LOVE PAT MCGRATH and will continue to Purchase her products to Add to my Massive Pat McGrath collection!!!!",3
"I just received this today and this is the best setting spray I have ever tried. I love that it comes with the full size as well as a travel size for the same price as just 1 full size. I literally just blew my nose and saw absolutely no makeup on the tissue. I was in disbelief. I have tried the cover fx dewy spray and it leaves a nice glow but makeup transfers with every little touch. This one leaves ur makeup looking natural and doesnt transfer at all. And as with all the brands sprays, I love the fine mist that comes out. Doesnt feel like Im spraying my makeup off lol and it dries quickly!",1
"I just repurchased. Eye cream is likely the most difficult product for me. I have very sensitive eyes, so I have tried many of the better brands. With Drunk Elephant I had no negative reaction like itching. After using it for a bit, I saw an improvement in the dark circles. But, being me, I still want to see if there's better. Well, I haven't found it if there is. So until someone tells me about a better one, I'll be buying this product.",3
"I just turned 41.  My skin has always been pretty good, besides for being oily and a little breakout once a month.   I have recently noticed my under eye area becoming dark, small/fine wrinkles and a little dry.  I started using this eye cream nightly about 2 weeks ago and I have already started seeing improvements.  The area seems more plump, my makeup is definitely sitting better and I noticed I don't need as much concealer in my under eye area.  Hopefully this will keep getting better with futher use!",2
"I just used this for the first time and I was SHOCKED when I rinsed it off— it really had brought everything to the surface of my pores! I couldn’t believe it. Truthfully I wasn’t sure exactly what to do next; I wished I had some pore strips which I imagine could have grabbed a lot of gunk to actually remove it. I did a couple of extractions, but I’m not one to stand there doing that for long. So I guess I’ll just continue to use it and hope that my pores get fully cleared out over time! Definitely worth a try.",0
"I just used this mask for the first time and I love it. I washed my face with a gentle moisturizer, applied the mask generously, let it sit for 20 minutes, and washed off with warm water. Afterwards I can still feel that I used a clay mask because if the drying sensation all clay masks have. I recommended following with a moisturizer. My skin feels brighter and has a healthy glow. I recommend if you’re in the market for a clay mask. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.",0
"I keep seeing good reviews and hype about the bum bum cream. Instead of spending $45 on the body cream, I decided to try this kit. When you put the cream on your skin, it feels and smells good. Don't use all 3 together. The smell of one product is very loud on its own. The body wash is basic. It's kind of runny, and you will use a lot just to lathered your whole body. The body mist is similar to any mist you get from BBW or drugstore. I wouldn't recommend buying everything separately. I recommend getting a kit or waiting for the bum bum cream to go on sale.",4
"I keep the travel size of this in my makeup kit for my clients and the full sized on my vanity for personal use. This is the perfect middle of the road moisturizer.  Not to heavy for oily prone skin and just enough moisture for dry skin. If you have combo skin, i would recommend this. \n\nFor my oily skinned sisters, I suggest using this at night. This will help your skin get the moisture it needs at night and not to over produce moisture (i.e. oil) during the day.",1
"I keep this in my travel makeup case. It's easy to do a quick neutral look or a look with a pop of color. I do wish the matte green was a little warmer, and since it's not I layer Night Trip on top of it and it looks really nice. The textures of the shadows are nice, they blend well, and stay on until I remove them with a makeup remover wipe. I do use an eyeshadow primer.",2
"I kept buying those and trying to like them but I give up now. But I cannot stand the stinging feeling and the overly strong mint flavor and smell that will never go away and that makes me nauseous. Dior, please bring back the previous addict glosses. I loved the way they were catching and reflecting the light and thus creating illusion for beautiful plump lips. Huge selection of shiny, sparkly colors. I miss them.",4
"I kind of fell in love with the bag first, of course, shiny and iridescent, who doesn't love that in the current trends? Inside is filled with a variety of lightweight glosses. Several I use over another lip colour to bring some shine and shimmer, a couple I have used on their own. A nice little splurge for myself as we get into the holiday's. Although I like glitter year round haha. Not all are super glittery, several have just a sheen of glitter, a few are more intensely glittery. Something for everyone, or every mood.",2
"I know a lot of folks see the influx of cannabis ingredients in products as a trendy thing, but my skin LOVES it. I learned this by using the Origins Hello Calm Mask (seriously...buy it) and decided to give this a go. I love it! I apply this as my serum step as it is incredibly lightweight and absorbs into the skin beautifully. I have hardly any redness anymore and my skin has such a beautiful glow. I use this in my morning and evening routines. The price point is also awesome. Just got my second bottle during the summer sale!",1
"I know everyone is saying the new formula isn't as good & I never tried that one, but I love this! It's super creamy & feels amazing on the lips & lasted for hours! I'm always reapplying my other balms but this one lasted so much longer. If you don't like a slippy lip balm them you probably wont like this, but I really enjoy it (:",4
"I know everyone loves this mascara, but it just wasn't for me. The wand bristles are really soft, so I felt like I didn't have so much control, and it clumped oddly. Messier application than most other mascaras I've tried. It also smudged on me by the end of the day, and I have other mascaras that don't do that. \nGiving it 3 because I don't hate it, I just don't like it.",0
"I know everyone raves about these, so I am the odd girl out - but I am just not in love with these.  It dries down tacky/sticky, and it really dries my lips.  I bought these when they first came out, and thought they had improved based on the rave reviews, but no. Colorwise,, 407 is a plum/mauve color with warm  undertones, a wearable color but nothing special.  If these dry your lips also, I  recommend the YSL water stains, big difference between the two.",3
"I know it says ""balm"", but I was definitely not expecting it to be the texture of candle wax. I'm wondering if mine is just dried out because it was coming away from the sides, and when I stuck my finger in, the whole thing lifted out in one piece. This can't be what they intended. It's kind of sandy in texture so it's really hard to rub in and drops crumbs all over your face? Also, I think it's burning my eyes and they're charging almost $40 for the super tiny amount you get? Yikes.",4
"I know the product is a 2-in-1, but I only use it as a toner. I don't think it works well with combination skin. It doesn't add enough moisture back to my skin after cleansing. Love how it feels as a toner though! I tried the fresh rose toner, and that somehow felt like it was stripping my skin (and also made me break out). I would recommend this product for those with sensitive skin with just needing a toner.",1
"I know there's a lot of dislike for KVD regarding her beliefs and I do believe some of the reviews are reviewing her and not the actual product. That being said, if there was no name brand on the palette I would look at this as a pretty safe color palette; neutrals with some colorful splashes. The shimmers are surprisingly buttery and glow like no tomorrow! The glitter was the biggest hit! I patted some glitter on with my finger over a dry cream shadow (it wasn't sticky anymore) and I only had one or two specs of glitter on my face after at least 6 hours of wear! Some of the  lighter colors can be a little monotonous, quite a few look very similar. I think they could have skipped some of those light nude shades, turned it into a smaller maybe lesser priced palette. All in all I think the brand played it safe with the shades they picked and with them adding only one glitter and a couple pops of color they were really trying to appease a wider group of consumers. I liked it!",2
"I know this is a product designed for KP which I deal with on the back of my arms but I bought this also for ingrown hairs/shaving. This stuff is amazing for all over, completely abolished red dots on my bikini area. I can't speak highly enough about both the texture and ingredients as well.  A perfect product!",0
I know this scrub is targeted more toward the male population. I’ve heard other women say they liked it as well. Tried it and enjoyed the cooling effect and it’s cleansing as well. Will buy again. Price is not bad either.,3
"I lack patience to apply liner to upper lid, and it often smears,  but I like the way it makes my eyes look. This is an excellent idea which works.  You linger at the base of lashes and rub a bit, and you end up with what looks like a lined upper lid... then you keep going up through the lashes for regular mascara.  You can go back to add a bit to gaps in the line or add another layer to lashes.  But it covers well.  And waterproof! The only thing to be aware of is that it's not a big tube of product. But I don't know how much you get in a regular mascara anyway.  Regardless it is worth it.  No stretching lids, poking self in eyes, etc.  One step. Yay.",2
I legit thought the palette was bigger; my mistake lol. I love the shades for they seem pretty essential. I'm so disappointed I got a travel size though... like @Sephora please let us know what size we're getting henceforth :'(,4
"I like both products from Peter Thomas Roth. It's a good deal, but the value is not $55.  \n\nThe regular size has 60 eye patches (30 pairs) sells for $52, and this one has 15 pairs, 30 eyes patches. The value should be $26\nThe Water Drench Hydrating moisturizer mini (0.67oz) sells for $22. \n\nSo the value should be $48 instead. Still it's a pretty good deal.",1
"I liked the regular sleep ones so I was going to pick these up because they have a different name so I figured these would have something extra to help skin or hair, since radiant sleep is different than just sleep. Nope. They are exactly the same, these are $3 more for a different name and collaboration branding. Just get the regular kind from the super market.",0
"I liked these brushes a lot more than I thought I would! I'm a newbie when it comes to brushes, contouring or anything other than eyeshadow and mascara. There is an easy breakdown guide inside its adorable case which was EXACTLY what I needed! While I'm no expert, the brushes seem to be a great quality especially for the price point. I bought this simply because I didn't know what else to get and I couldn't be happier!",1
"I liked this eye cream. It was good but I wasn't blown away. You get very little for the price, I went through the bottle quickly. I also hate the packaging. Sooo much plastic garbage for 15 ml of product...",1
"I liked this mask a lot, though I've only used it once. I got a sample and used it in my nightly routine after a gentle peel. It seemed to make all the products I used after it really sink into my skin. Definitely considering buying full size",4
I liked this product a lot but it isn't very hydrating. Usually had to use another a more moisturizing eye cream underneath or at the end of the day. It works well and the tint does make you look more awake but wouldn't recommend it to someone with sensitive skin.,0
"I liked using this, but I think the price doesn't exactly justify the results. I have combo skin and this was nice. However, I would recommend this for someone who has a true oily skin type, since with even the minor dehydration I deal with, it didn't hydrate as well as I would have hoped. I loved the sensorial aspect to using this as it has that water burst effect where it melts into a water-thin consistency as you massage it into the skin. Overall, it is a nice product, but doesn't exactly deliver on any pore-perfecting or anti-aging properties that it claims to have, especially when it has such a high pricetag.",4
I like experimenting with blending colors to achieve a natural look.  A barely have any eye brows and this makes me look like I have naturally thick brows. The wax and the powders work well together. And it stays on all day.,2
"I like how easily the concealer blends into the skin.  Unlike other concealers, this one wears really light so you don’t get that heaviness underneath the eyes.  It is a matte finish but I wouldn’t say it’s full coverage on the first layer it’s more of a light to medium and it’s buildable to full.  I have minor dark circles and after applying one layer I can still see the darkness peaking through.   I’ve tried doubling the layer but it gets really cakey and started to crease really bad.  It doesn’t really cover my acne spots or redness unless I double the layers but even so it was hard to build up the coverage without it rubbing off.  I would say this is an okay concealer it wouldn’t be something I would purchase once I finish it.\n\nI received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.",0
I like how this moisturizer feels on my skin.  It isn't too heavy and it goes on smoothly.  I really like the dispenser as it will keep the product from picking up bacteria from your hands.  Very clever.,3
"I like it, but I went through it in a month.  (I feel that's becoming a common issue with various brands though.) But, I was expecting out of the gate a two month use.  Price point is okay.\n\nPros: able to select a shade easily without going in store.  Always a plus.  Also, THAT LITTLE BRUSH ❤️ It's just too cute and it actually disperses the product well.  I use the little brush everyday even though the pencil is finished.\n\nCon: Goes on too lightly, I often feel I needed a brow tint after I applied.  And, it only lasted a month... and that's not with continuous use.",2
"I like it but wouldn't buy it again. I think the foundation itself is nice but learned that you need to layer it on thinly otherwise it will look cakey. I also hate it without a primer and it does not work well with the Hourglass primer but does work well the Smashbox Photo Finish primer. The packaging is unique, I'll give it that, but it wears out it's novelty after the first time using it. The makeup gets stuck underneath the nozzle and is really hard to clean, even with a q-tip. The shade range is a bit lacking as most people know as I'm really in between a 1.40 and 1.50. I think you can make this work for you but it just doesn't do a great job on its own.",2
"I like the 2 bum bum cream products in this set and the beautiful packaging. After I bought 2 of these sets,  I figured out they contained the old coco cabana formula once i saw Sol de Janeiro's Instagram story on how to tell the difference between the new formula and the old formula. They must have filled these sets with old stock of the old coco cabana cream to get rid of it. Pretty disappointing.",1
"I like the brush and the fact that the pencil is then, but it didn’t break the first time I used it. My brows are somewhat thick, but then towards the end so I don’t have to do much stoking. I would purchase again and recommend. I’m live the brush on the end. It lifts the hairs so much hat you can get as many strokes of the pencil as needed.",3
"I like the clean formulation and creamy texture, but the color payoff and longevity are poor. It might be the colors I chose -- Lady Bird and All of Me -- which when blended barely show up on my light olive skin. Part of this might be due to the slight sheen of the product. For the amount of effort it takes to build the color up, I think I'd be better off with a more pigmented product. Your mileage may vary, obviously.",3
"i like the color it leaves, like a violet-pink tint on my lips. going on it feels nice and smooth, but with continual use (after 2 day) it made my lips chap too much so i had to discontinue. It may work well for others so for the sale price to try it's not too bad.",2
I like the fragrance and that there is no top to take off.  My problem is that it's difficult to get an even mist from the pump.  Sometimes it comes out with a fine mist and the next spray will be wet!   It needs a little more work for it to be a full 5 stars,3
"I like the lip scrub, cute packaging as well but I don't think I would buy again because elf also has the same lip scrub for a better price. would recommend if you dont mind spending the money and love all things fenty.",0
"I like the palette.dont get me wrong...but by no means is it worth over 50.00...As far as the shadow, it goes on nicely..blends well but so do a lot of other..much larger palettes..I'd save the money to be honest with you...and I'm definitley not in love with Charlotte Tilbury or her prices as I've bought other products from het foundation, brow gel and lip gloss...rip off..better brands on the market",1
I like the shape of this sponge with the flat side for applying powder or blending in more precise areas of the face and rounder side for applying foundation all over. My only issue is that I think it's a little softer than what I'm used to with the beauty blender.,1
"I like the way my lashes look after using this mascara, but I repeatedly have to over them like 4 to 6 times to get the look I want. I see the length forming but the volume is harder to produce. It's a very dry formula and not a lot comes off the brush and i tend to go for something a tad clumpy anyway. I do really like this mascara because it lasts all day with no smearing or flaking but so easy to clean off at the end of the day.",1
"I like the way the product finishes. It looks flawless, the color is great, and it wears fairly well all day.  I have normal/dry skin and I like it with the Bobbi Brown face base.  Its very pretty on.   Only 4 stars because the price for the tiny container hurts the pocket book some.",3
"I like this balm as far as how it feels on my lips. It's not sticky or slippery at all, and seems to last a while. However, I'm not impressed by the color payoff at all. I love sheer tints as I'm not a fan of lipsticks, and bought this shade hoping it would provide a sheer gray-blue tint. However, it is nothing more than sparkly clear on my pale lips. I'll keep it because it does feel nice, but would not buy again at this price as it's just a clear balm on me.",2
"I like this, but it took some time to figure out how to make it work for me. I use it as a wash off mask just before applying makeup. It makes my skin plump and the makeup looks pretty afterwards. I don't use it as an overnight mask, though!",1
"I like this, but there are other cheaper and just as effective products on the market. The lotion itself visibly reduces fine lines, but does little to nothing to reduce puffiness. I love the smell and the lotion is great for under concealer. I give it three stars because I wish it also reduced puffiness and dark circles. I would recommend this product for someone mainly looking for fine line visibility.",1
I like this but they are not a must buy. I used these to do an amateur at home dermaplaning. They worked. You should be careful because they are sharp; sharp enough to cut my face. It isn't a must buy because it is larger and harder to use in smaller areas. My skin was smoother. It removed the hair and dead skin from my face. DO NOT PEEL AND USE THESE. I suggest using a hydrating serum/mask after using this across the face.,1
i like this concealer. I recieved it from influenster to try for free. The consealer for shiseido is very buildable and coverage is thick and full. i like how it looks once applied. it sets into your skin and doesnt budge.,2
"I like this cream. It's not quite enough moisture for my very dry skin, but I've been using it with a little bit of my regular moisturizer, and love how it feels on my skin. I think normal and oily skin would find the level of moisture sufficient. I received this product in exchange for an honest review and can say that it's a fantastic product, but I don't know if I would personally buy it again only because my skin is so dry.",2
"I like this liner. Although, if you're used to a super soft, creamy pencil, it may shock you. I think this formula is easier to use and sharpen, and that comes from it being a little bit tougher. It does what any good lip liner should do with ease, but is it a little over priced in comparison to other products? Maybe so.",4
"I like this palette but I dont love it. I ended up having to pull out my Urban Decay basics palette. There are NO light matte shades. The foils are pretty however, there isnt a bright inner corner shade. There are abundance of pretty lid shades & crease colors. The formula is very good! I'll keep it but I wouldn't repurchase if I lost it.",3
"I like this palette quite a lot! The shade range is versatile going from neutral, to purple, to pink, to golden, and warm nudes. Of course your enjoyment of this aspect depends on your colour preferences! Blue and green lovers need not apply. However, some of these shimmer/glitter shades are a bit rough to work with at times. Also, I don't think powderiness even needs to be addressed in a review about an ABH palette. :P",0
"I like this product and began using it together with the Murad lightening gel about 2 weeks ago. I had to stop the Murad product (couldn’t tolerate the odor) but am finding that the tranexamic acid is already lightening my smaller sun spots.  I will update as time progresses to see if it is effective with my larger spot.  For reference, I have combination/oily, light olive skin with lots of damage from tanning (I now wear SPF50 every day!). The product has a soft gel feel that seems to absorb better if patted in rather than rubbed, at least in my experience. You will probably want to put on a moisturizer or face oil afterward.",2
"I like this product, but you definitely have to work with it. My recommendation is to put some on the back of your hand, wet a beauty sponge, and quickly tap it where you want it since it dries down. not really beginner friendly. its also hella sparkly. not subtle at all",0
"I like this solely as a blotting powder throughout the day.  It’s very finely milled and is great at de-greasing without adding bulk to existing makeup.  As a person who is VERY oily...this will be a staple in my kit!  I did try this a few different times/ways as a setting powder (I normally use Laura Mercier) and it was not substantial enough to properly set my foundation.  It may work for someone less oily, though!",2
"I like to use a tinted moisturizer with light coverage for everyday outings. I have very dry sensitive skin. I bought this one because it was part of the MoistureSurge line, and I've liked some other products in this line. When I use this product, my skin becomes flaky and irritated. It is definitely NOT moisturizing. If you have normal or oily skin, it might work for you. But, it creates a flaky mess of my very dry skin.",3
I like to use glitter over my polish. I don't love thetime and effort to get it off. I thought this might at least make it slightly less time consuming. It didn't. This was no more effective than the cheap non acetone stuff I was using before. The hunt continues.,4
"I like to use The Ordinary's mandelic acid and put this on top. I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to skincare, but the I feel as though the mandelic acid keeps me from breaking out while this product brightens my skin and reduces acne scarring. \n\nThe only downside is that I have combination skin and, with daily use, the dry parts of my face (around my mouth and along my jawline) get SUPER dry and flaky. However, take this with a grain of salt because, thanks to my PCOS, I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out. I think that if you moisturize daily your face should be glowy and clear in no time!",0
I like to use this product after a oily moisturizer because it is not very moisturizing. IMO Josie Maran is much better for drier older skin. This has a matte finish which I don't really like on my middle aged skin but the color is very natural in fact I could even go one darker with no problems.,3
"I like vanilla and the fact that this balm was color-changing. It doesn't seem to absorb or moisturize but sit on the lips... so I realized to just dab on a little with my finger. Just enough for some color and semi glossy lip. The packaging is terrible though. After a couple of weeks, the seam of the tube has come apart.",3
I literally had to read up on this phenomenon -- that hyaluronic acid can actually have the opposite effect. This is not a holy grail for me. A few drops and my skin felt just as tight as when I tried The Ordinary. I considered trying Good Molecules but it's likely more of the same. Currently awaiting The Ordinary Marine version-- if that doesn't work I'll go back to NIOD ...,2
"I live in a very dry area and have had genetically dark circles since I was in middle school. I kept hearing about how wonderful this cream is. Sadly it hasn't done much for me: while it may have slightly reduced the darkness of my circles, it hasn't hydrated my under eye area nearly as well as other creams and caused my concealer to sink into my very fine crows feet and creases (I'm in my mid 20s), aging me.",0
"I live this lipbalm! it's like an oil for you lips ! I put it before bed, while doing my makeup to prep the lips and just for hydration during the day. it doesn't just smell good, it also works wonders!",4
"I'll admit that I didn't read the directions because I assumed you smear it on your face and wash it off whenever, so I don't know how long I had it on. I had dry skin that made foundation look really flaky and like it was sinking into portions of my face. I bought this and got a sample of an overnight moisture mask. After I used this mask I noticed an immediate difference. It did have a very strong scent, so if you're sensitive to that,  I wouldn't recommend this product. I didn't care for the scent, but I can tolerate it since I was very pleased with the results.",2
"I'll be honest I have never been the lash primer type and I didnt think Id like it but using this with my mascara really makes my eyes pop. I don't use the primer every day, I use it only for special occasions but I now prefer using this with my mascara rather than wearing false lashes.",4
I'll be sending it back. Very pricey for how tiny the tube is and the ingredients are similar to Eczema Honey Co. which is the same price but you get a 4 oz. jar and no petrolatum or paraffin (if you're worried about those things).,1
"I'll never be able to say enough good things about this concealer. The formulation is phenomenal. It works for all skin types. In summer I'm quite oily while in winter I'm very dry. With this concealer you'd never know the difference. Not to mention it lasts and lasts and lasts. A little goes a long way, so you're for sure getting your money's worth too. I bought my first tube months ago and it's only halfway gone. Amazing stuff!",0
"I'll start by saying that I have never been a big highlighter user.  I've never found one that suited me or that matched my extra fair skin tone.  But, after receiving a sample from Sephora and playing with it a little, I really love this beautiful highlighter. It is buildable and glittery and quite bold.......and just so beautiful. I'm hooked.  Now I want to try the other shades. I highly recommend this product!",3
"I’ll start this with - I HATE liquid lipsticks. I have tried oh so many brands and they all leave my already dry lips, parched and shriveled. I gave up a year ago on them. I recently bought this one because of the color. It really is a true red. No blue or orange undertone. Just red. It’s perfect, so I gave it a go and I’m so glad I did. Finally a comfortable liquid lipstick. Doesn’t dry out my lips, can barely even feel it on, and it doesn’t transfer. I definitely am going to be picking up more colors.",0
I look forward to this set every holiday season! The two full size mascara I enjoy much more than last years set. This is a great opportunity to try brands you maybe wouldn’t think of trying. I personally would rather have more mascara and skip on the false lashes.,1
"I loooove this powder. I use it as a foundation by it self. It has really good coverage. Doesn't cover all my freckles, but enough to even out my skintone. It really blurs the pores and has a good staying power. It doesn't make my skin dry (I have dry skin already). At the end of the day, my forehead is a little bit shiny but not oily. I really recommend this powder. I liked the it cosmetics illumination powder but this one is better because it blurs the pores. I love the effect on my skin.",4
I loooove this! The colour is so pretty and the finish is super comfortable to wear. It's not sticky or tacky its more of a silky finish. It's a little pricey tho but I will repurchase again I  hope they never get rid of it!,2
"I love ABH dip brow pomade, it's my go to. But I tried something new with a different color and I wasn't super satisfied with it. The Auburn in the photo is not what the product looks like. It's a medium brown, at best. There is no reddish tint to it whatsoever. I'll still use it because I love the quality of the product. But be warned that the description may not match what you receive.",0
"I love a dark green/black eye pencil for my hazel eyes--it really makes them pop even more than a navy eyeliner.  I originally used Chanel's but it was discontinued, so I was really happy to find this one that is every bit as good as Chanel if not better, especially since I found the Overt color.",4
"I love Algenist products, and I really wanted to love this. However, despite the ""Universal color-correcting beige"" color, it is not universal if you're fair-skinned like me.  This just looked like dirt on me, and oh how I tried blending it a zillion different ways.\n\nI feel badly for giving it a 3-star rating; I'm sure this stuff is great for anyone who isn't fair/light.\n\nHad to return it. :-(",3
"I love all the attachments that you can buy to cater to your own skin needs. I have found my pores to be smaller, skin clearer and my face just feels so clean. I gave this 4 stars, cause my first one, the battery died. Although Clarisonic will replace it for free.",4
I love all the Becca highlights. Smooth almost creamy and doest emphasize texture. I've been using these guys for years. I just dont like Jaclyn Hill and I find her annoying but I do like her highlighter. I have all of the shades.,2
"I love almost all things Mother... but not this mascara.  This formula creates bold, black, fan-like lashes that are beautiful... for about an hour... and then my beautiful eyelashes are joined by dark smudges under my eyes which become flakes as the day progresses... I wanted so much to like this formula, so have tried it with and without concealer, powders, staying sprays... nothing helped...",3
I love a multi-use product so this one is already winning because of its versatility. Honestly it goes beyond my expectations by wearing long without feeling sticky or actually staining. It feels hydrating without being greasy or goopy. I also love that it's not scented.,2
I love a nice wispy lash. These are so light weight and easy to apply. They give a little drama for a nice night out but can also be used for daily wear. I received this product free but all thoughts are my own.,0
I love anything peach I've had all peach anything and everything this set I've already but separate it's all good and smells so good my favorite so yummy If I had enough too face peach I would aply all day and night yummiest set tooface you are every thing to me think you tooface appreciation too you,2
I love applying serums before I lather on moisturizer. This serum felt hydrating the  moment it touches your face and then it absorbed almost immediately so the wait time between serum and moisturizer was minimal. Which I prefer.  I also love the packaging of this new bottle so much. Great addition to my vanity.,2
"I love baby facial, but the rest of drunk elephant products are meh for me. They make my skin feel nice to the touch, but it feels drier overall than before I used them. This is fine for babyfacial (which is amazing at fixing the discoloration from picking at acne), but the ordinary's marula oil is just as good, and the rest of the products are meh for me (should add I'm Boston-based and need hydration during the winter!).\n\nAll of these products may work well if you live in a humid environment, but they are drying in the winter as a northeasterner",0
"I love bareMinerals and use many of their complexion products. Been eager to try this Night Treatment. Finally took the plunge when it was on special. A nice feeling applying this at night. Very calming and soothing. I can't say I noticed much in the way of results. What I wasn't expecting was the scent, or should I say odor! Wow something odd and not at all in a good way. I wish I could describe it. What I can say is I think it is very unlikely that this is how Bareminerals intended any product to smell. I have to wonder if it is a freshness issue? Very old or exposed to elements, poor storage? I use a lot of their foundations and other powder/crushed mineral products daily over 14 yrs as a customer, they all have no scent or smell really great. This was a bizarre departure. 3 stars because I believe it is a good brand over all. And might continue using or possible benefit anyway if not for the scent.",2
"I love BB foundation.  This is the third time I am ordering it. The moisturizer, however, did not seem to work well with the foundation.  It is a also a primer.  I found that I had to be careful not to use another moisturizer under it of it got all blotchy.  Not sure I like it enough to use as my everyday moisturizer.",4
"I love blush.  I have fair skin, and blush is a must have for me.  I like pigmented blushes, and these have the color impact that I prefer.  I also love the highlight in the gold set.  Great value overall, fun to use packaging, and a great range of colors.  This is such a nice alternative to so many eye and blush palettes that have had repetitive color schemes within the same set, with tones looking the exact same once applied even though they look slightly different in the pan.  ( I see you Natasha Denona!) Very pleased with this purchase.",1
I love Bobbi Brown products & this eyeliner is no exception. It glides on the delicate eye line area with the greatest of ease. It smudges nicely & has great staying power. I highly recommend this product.,3
"I love Boscia blotting wipes .. the green tea ones used to be my go to! they don't stock them so I thought I'd give these a try. They smell really good and are pretty big BUT the do take off more makeup than the green tea ones. 4 stars for cost - great bang for their buck, smell and size of blotting paper and does get oil off. 1 star off for also taking off make up.",1
"I love both of the body oils, but Jasmine is my absolute favorite scent of the two.  I use these oils when I get out of the shower, using a damp wash cloth to pump 4-5 pumps of the oil onto it for different areas of my body, and ""dry"" myself with the cloth.  This body oil is light, but very effective.  It's not sticky at all, and calms my sensitive skin year round.  I also use a little as a hair oil.  The scent is light, and intoxicating.. I LOVE the scent of Jasmine.  It's not strong as if it were a perfume, but it lasts on me most of the day.  I am getting some for my daughter for her birthday.  I am positive she is going to LOVE this!",3
"I love brow wiz, but it’s so little for the price and breaks easily unfortunately. However, this kit is a great deal. I love everything in it. I tried dipbrow gel for the first time, and I’m in love. My brows are done in seconds with the gel. I just comb my brows back and forth then clean the edges with a q tip. It literally takes less than a minute, and it lasts all day.",1
"I love Buxom Lip Gloss! Non-sticky and long-wearing. Although I don't think there's much plumping, I do enjoy the feel and scent of the formula. Does not add color to the lips but delivers great shine!",2
"I love buying sample sets as they're an effective way to try a line, that being said I didnt care for most of these. the cleanser was nothing special, nor did I care for the vitamin c serum, had a rancid smell and didnt soak in well at all. I did like the night resurfacing serum and marula oil but not enough to purchase. this had such great reviews, but I dont get the hype. total letdown.",1
"I love Caudalie products, this beauty elixir is not an exception! The smell is light and refreshing. I like to use it before my skin care routine and after putting the makeup as the setting  spray. The only issue that I have is the after used half bottle,  it's so difficult to get the rest of the product out. Most of the time like 90%, it only spray out air instead of the product inside the bottle. So sad to see half bottle sitting on my vanity that can't use.",2
I love cleansing balms and when I saw this was $12 I was interested (I used a handful of drug store ones for this price but never at a Sephora).\n\nIt works okay and by that it removes about 80% of my makeup. I use a washcloth to get the balm off. And I'll wash my face with my preferred face wash afterwards. I follow up with micellar water to get what the balm did not get. \n\nThe size is TINY! Only 0.71 ounces. After doing a brief search on the website if you convert this balm to an average size it would equal around $30. \n\nI just take this when I travel now because otherwise it would be gone within 1 to 2 weeks.,1
"I loved it because it moisturized without feeling greasy, I feel like it definite did something as a primer. This definitely got added to my love/emptied pile. When I get tired of trying something new, I'd definitely give it a try again!",0
"I loved most things in this Day kit, and I now love everything.  D-Bronzi and Umbra Sheer has finally won me over. I applied Protini, then D-Bronzi, then Umbra Sheer, and my brown skin looked flawless.",3
"I loved the color of this lipstick but it didn't serve me well. First off, although the container is pretty, I was afraid to travel overseas with it, thinking the sharp point might lead it to be taken away if in my carry-on. Most importantly, my particular lipstick didn't maintain it's shape/consistency and is messy to use - even when it was quite new. Wonder if my product is defective.",3
"I loved the packaging, so silky smooth, just like the product application. Soft and sort of powdery, applying with fingers has better payoff then using a brush. I did try wetting a brush a little, and that helped but it's easier to just use your fingers. I loved how easy to blend this product was, really made for a nice smokey eye.\nI received this product for free for testing purposes, the opinions are my own.",1
"I loved the scent and thought it was a beautiful shimmer oil, but the bottle was SO big and the price pretty hefty for someone not wanting to use it every day. Per Patrick Ta's website, minis are available and probably the perfect product for me since I returned the big bottle.",0
"I loved these shadows ever since they were introduced to me whilst on vacation in London last Summer.  The formula is smooth, creamy, and is reliable with no fall out.  I love how easy it is to build intensity with this eyeshadow just by applying more product or with a slightly damp finger.  Yes, fingers work best as I've tried application with a brush.  Each pot is slightly smaller than the original individual pots and I wished that the product description would have mentioned this.  For the price, it is still a good value for an expensive product and will last a long while.  Fortunately, I don't have any of these colours, so what a find for me!  Try this limited edition out; you won't be disappointed!",3
I loved this color. Creamy yet not runny like other cream lipsticks. Lasted most of the day too. It's the main reason for the rating. The only thing I could complain on is the odd smell. Almost overwhelming. It kind of reminds me of melted crayons but not in a good way. I hoped to purchase the full size but that's not happening if it naturally smells like that.,2
I loved this! It left my face feeling super clean and fresh and it didn't just last a couple of minutes. I've used a lot of different products from different companies and I really liked this one. Will definitely be using it more in the future and recommend it! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,0
"I loved this liner at first! I went to lightly itch the corner of my eye and I felt something flake. when I looked in the mirror I noticed that my wing had totally flaked off. :( I adore melt cosmetics, but this one is a hard pass.",0
I loved this lipstick because it is so hard to find a color that will go over black lips and this did it well and I was able to create a nice ombre. I got so many compliments on it. I would definitely buy it again.,0
"I loved this product, was stunning and beautiful. exactly what I am looking for... wet dewy sheen. \nBut after two uses the product was all gone. It leaked (stored upright on my shelf) and nothing came out. Had it less than a week. Very disappointed.",4
I loved this set! I was honestly surprised I would like them this much. The formula was super creamy to put on and lasted all through my christmas eve! It didnt feather or budge. The most important thing to me was that my lips didnt feel tight or dry!,0
"I loved this stuff so much.... until it got in my hair! Both myself & my 14 year old daughter have major damage to our ends. When we used it on our shoulders & it got on the ends of our hair... it caused irreversible damage (according to our stylist). The only thing we can do is chop our hair off... so we are currently living with damaged, straw-like, unmanageable hair. I'm guessing it's because this stuff has some kind of drying agent. It really needs to have some kind of major warning on the label to not use anywhere near your hair!",2
"I love everything about this cream.  I use it just at night, and my skin is fabulous.  I am using it on my lips, and I finally feel like something is helping them!  So dried out from winter-this is the only thing working for me.   Expensive, but worth it.  You use just a little bit.  And I love the little scoop too.",2
I love everything about this pallet all of the colors are very wearable they can be built up or blended out\nI like to do monochromatic looks once in a while and this makes it very easy. I also love the packaging. This would make an excellent gift !I Highly recommend!,3
"I love everything in this kit.  Adding a little A-Passioni to Lala avoids peeling. Protini is everything.  Slaai leaves my face feeling pampered, as part of a double cleanse. I  totally underestimated B-Hydra.  During the winter months, my oily skin becomes dry, and I used to add a little oil to my moisturizer.  I should have been adding one pump of B-Hydra instead.  My skin feels incredibly nourished now.",3
"I love everything olehenriksen!   I am a skincare junkie and when this came out I had to buy!  I initially bought for my mom, because she has very sensitive skin and has issues using any acids without it frying her skin. She is now obsessed with this and so am I !  I use this once a week, since I use so many other acids daily, anyway I tend to use before applying makeup and it makes me look flawless!  tightens pores and controls oil. if I have any dry spots, this stuff takes care of them.",2
"I love everything that Fenty Beauty puts out and was super excited to buy this brow pencil, but I must say I don't find anything too special about it. The formula is great and I do actually enjoy the brush I feel like it really does blend the colour effortlessly into your eyebrows buuut it's just like any other standard brow pencil. I typically use precisely my brow from benefit and I actually prefer that formula. This formula is a bit more dry so I feel like it actually takes me longer to fill in my brows. The price point is great and like I said I do like the brush, but it's not revolutionary.",4
"I love exfoliators and this is a gem. I got it in a sephora favorites kit and it was a mini size. I use two dime sized amounts twice weekly and leave it on for 2-3 minutes after scrubbing. I personally like a fine grit on my skin to remove the dead skin  cells so this is perfect. 2-3 minutes after I rinse my face,my skin feels so smooth and hydrated ... I believe there are some hydrators in this formula that aid with hydrating and smoothing. My mini size is still in use (it's been at least 6 months)  so worth it and I would definitely buy again.",1
"I love eyebrow products! But this is one that I simply can not like. It is heavy, messy, and gooey. It smears so easily and is extremely hard to get off the the skin. I did give it three stars because when the product finally adheres to the proper place it is beautiful! It is just so much trouble getting it there.",3
"I love Farmacy, everything I have tried I have lived and repurchased... NOT this.. \nIn all honesty it may not be fair to judge as I only  used this 3x . But it burned!!! I could not last a full day on any of my attempts before washing it off and going back to Native. I wanted to like this at least but nope definetly a hard pass.",3
"I love First Aid Beauty, so when I saw this set I knew I had to purchase it. It's such an amazing deal. The body cream is my absolute favorite and the the one I reach for the most especially during winter because it's super hydrating.  \nI've tried All the products in this kit except for the serum whichI cant wait to try because I've heard great things about it.",2
"I love fresh products but bummed about size vs cost ratio. This is basically travel size minis. if that's what you want then this will be great. Comes in small box. Intended to give these as a main, stand alone gift but now need to get something else with it, or return. Overall wasn't impressed with the qty.",1
"I love Glow Recipe's watermelon moisturizer and sleeping mask.  Are they really doing wonders for my skin?  Haven't noticed a huge difference, I'm probably just suckered in because I love the scent of it.  I was super excited to try this jelly sheet mask.\n\nPositives:  Felt very cooling on the skin, which I can really appreciate since I live in a very hot and humid climate.\nThe Jelly texture felt better than ordinary sheet masks.\nOf course the scent is heavenly!\n\nNegatives:  The mask kept sliding down my face, so I strongly suggest you use this when you're able to just lay down flat in bed.  The top eye portion of the mask didn't fit right.  Also, the jelly material is VERY easily torn.  My mask tore in several areas, and I was being as careful as I could.",2
"I love hourglass products. It didn't pull or tug on my skin or brow hairs. The only problem was the pencil snapped off, at the tip about 1/4"" size. I sent it back and reordered. When I was using the replacement, the pencil just fell out of the case while I was using the brush. Have the ingredients been changed or are they of lesser quality? I've never had that happen before with Hourglass. I am currently using the one that fell out (2nd pic). I just didn't feel like going thru the reorder/return hassle, again. Do I recommend this pencil? I'm not sure now, try at your discretion. There needs to be a maybe box!",3
"I love how gentle this product is. I have sensitive skin and rosacea, and this has not caused any flare ups. My skin feels smoother, make up applies so much more evenly, and I feel like I glow.\n\nThe pump is smooth to use and I love that the pink mask turns to white when you massage it in. It doesn't drip and feels comfortable on while you continue about your home as it works. \n\u2063\nWill continue to use time and time again.\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n*I received this product complimentary for testing purposes\n\u2063\n#PHATGLOW\xa0#contest\xa0#complimentary\xa0@olehenriksen\xa0@Influenster",1
"I love how hyaluronic acid plumps up my skin,  and as this is supposed to be four times better,  I expected good if not great things.  But it just doesn't perform for me.  It feels acrylic and fake going on,  and holds absolutely no moisture.  I've tried rotating it around my routine, putting different products on before and after it,  and it simply never seems to add anything.  If anything,  it puts a barrier on my skin that prevents moisture from fattening it up the way it should.  I can't compare other brands with this ingredient as I've seen none,  and reading about the great results other people are getting makes me all the more disappointed.  This is clearly a product that doesn't work for everyone.  At least it didn't break me out.",3
i love how it has a really fresh smell and really does give an instant glow to the eye area. you really should continue daily use with any eye product to see dramatic changes. Highly recommended . i love it,1
"I love how it smells, and how my skin feels. It never seems to soak into my skin and just lays on top no matter how much I rub it in. Great product otherwise though. \n*I received this product as a complimentary gift from influenster*",4
I love how light and clean this feels on the skin. The spout allows for just the right amount to come out.  It spreads over the skin easily and absorbs fairly quickly.  Works great in combination with the Tatcha brightening serum. My skin looked plumper and more even within 7 days of using this. I did receive this free for complementary testing.,2
"I love how medium to full coverage this mattifying powder is. If you have oily skin, this is the pressed powder for you. I wear it alone when needed, and on top of liquid foundation if I want more coverage on a night out",0
I love how my skin feels after using this. It seems to also help with my skin texture. I have sensitive skin and didn't react to this. Seems like there's a decent amount in the container and I will get many uses out of it.,1
"I love how rich this is. I haven't seen a difference in my dark circles like I hoped, but my undereyes are more hydrated than they were with other eye creams. I really love the packaging, it's very travel safe.",4
I love how this feels on my face. It’s bubbles up so I know it’s really working and smells great! I love that it’s gentle but I feel it working because my face feels smooth after. I received this complementary,3
"I love how this mascara feels and looks on my lashes, but it smudges underneath my eyes if it's even slightly humid outside and it looks like I've been running. Love the natural formula though and it's fine when it's not raining or the air is more dry outside.",0
"I love it! A lot of product comes out with a full pump. I use a half a pump for each eye, it's more than enough. I really like the roller ball, it feels great and I feel like I don't waste any product. My eyes feel hydrated.",1
"I love it!! It literally made my skin calm from its redness right before my eyes basically. This stuff is truly amazing and absorbs quickly. I will say though, since I saw others mention this, it did break me out. But I fought through it, because skin does purge, and I am glad I did! Little white heads started popping up in places. I was so upset, because I love this product, but they weren't like my normal hormonal acne. It's been about three weeks now and my skin is clear! And it's fading previous scars and my skin isn't red. It's pricey but I'm glad I invested in this product.",4
I love just dabbing 3-4 drops on my face before going to bed and before makeup. My skin feels super hydrated and supple. Your makeup will look so glowy!!! Have recommended this to a few people and they are hooked as well!,1
"I love lip liners that are creamy and glide on easily but I also like drier formulas, like MAC, because they last all day. I find these NARS liners to be the perfect combination of the two. They are smooth and apply super easy but yet they don't budge. I took one star off because even though they are really nice, $24 is pretty expensive for a lip liner.",1
"I love liquid shimmer shadows and I'm very impressed by this formula!  It's a refined shimmer, not glittery, applies and blends out easily and can be sheered out or built up to look more foiled.  Once dried, it doesn't budge and I didn't have any fallout.  I do recommend applying it over a primer or glitter glue, especially those with hooded eyes, to avoid creasing if applying more than a slight wash of shimmer.  Although Magnetic is described as brown, it's actually more of a mid toned silvery taupe that easily pairs with many different looks.  I highly recommend these shadows and will definitely be picking up more colors.",2
"I love love LOVE it. I was planning on wearing falsies to complete my valentines day look, but I was pleasently surprised and loved the length and volume of my natural lashes using this product. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1
"I love love LOVE it. I was planning on wearing falsies to complete my valentines day look, but I was pleasently surprised and loved the length and volume of my natural lashes using this product. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1
I love love love this foundation powder!  I have the foundation and I like it enough but I am an oily girl and I thought I could use this to darken my winter shade match with it for summer use.  When used in conjuction with the Too Faced Hangover primer my skin was FLAWLESS!!!! Natural finish and stayed all day!  I was so impressed.  I love Too Faced Complexion products!!,3
"I love love love this oil. Much better than the many others I have tried. It absorbes quickly without leaving a film, it has lighted up my dark spots. I only can find it online, I hope Sephora doesn’t stop carrying this brand.",2
"I love Lunar. One of the best things is how long it lasts. I can put it on and the glitter lasts all day into the next. Depending on how you layer Lunar, you can have a subtle glitter sheen to full on radiant sparkle. Must have for all those who love glitter and sparkle. I have sensitive skin, never gotten a rash or breakout from Lunar.",4
I love milk products and really wanted this to work. The product only held for about 30 minutes before my brows lost the bushy look. My brows are medium-thick so it looked great at first.. then they just had a weird wet-look .,0
"I love most of the items in here! The Kaja blush stamp is super cute, not really my color but I blend it with another color. The ND blush and highlight is great. My favorite is the Violet Voss liquid shadow, makes blue eyes pop! The milk stick is useful for my skin care routine. The melt lipstick is an okay color, more of a light brown nude than a pink nude. The only complaints I have is the farsali bottle is soooooo tiny it will only last a few uses and the artist couture I will probably never use because it is just straight up glitter. I love more of a glitter shimmer like the VV shadow not just straight glitter. I bought this on sale for 25$ so I would say definitely worth the price!",0
"I love Nails Inc, and I have purchased two bottles of the Old Bond Street color. I will say, it is very dark. Unless you are outside or in a very well-lit room, it will look almost black. I still quite like it, and I purchased another for my sister.",1
I love Noni Bright vitamin C Serum I received it complimentary and I used every morning and I have noticed my acne scarring and dark spots has become lighter tremendously and I highly recommend product,2
I love nost CT products but this concealer is not one of them. It makes my undereyes look cakey and dry but the biggest problem I have is the packaging and lack of product. It is nearly impossible to get the cap off and it keeps me from ever reaching for it. I have to click it so much for a tiny bit if product to come out and after a few uses its halfway gone.,2
I love peach tones - I'm a fan of ABH and this didn't disappoint me! This is pigmented so a little goes a long way! I was really intimidated by the orange 'miami' shade but it is so flattering on my olive tone complexion! I also like to lightly dip my brush into all three shades  - I love the fresh peach tones of this trio! Perfect for summer!!,4
I love Sephora Favorites Kits! It's great to try out products before buying full size. This set offers a good variety of items. I purchased it mainly for the mascara but ended up enjoying everything included.\nGive it a try! Recommend!,3
"I love that Becca has the minnie highlighters to match the large ones. I never hit pan on regular size highlighters & will get bored pretty easily using the same highlighter every day. I always feel like I'm wasting money when buying $30-$40 highlighters. I didn't know Becca sold these Minnie's till I saw them while shopping in Sephora. Vanilla Quartz is a beautiful white gold shift highlighter that has a amazing dewy gold reflect! It's wet looking & not loaded with glitter like most glitters on the market now. The packaging is very elegant, sturdy & high end. Just like the regular Becca highlighter packaging but small. I plan on buying all of them because Becca has great highlighters.",2
I love that it's tinted and it brightens up my undereye. I wouldn't recommend if you have dry undereyes. It does brighten the undereye area beautifully. It is not moist. It blended okay with concealer for a couple of days before it started looking streaky. You don't need a lot product to cover.  I will use it on more casual days when I don't feel like I need concealer. Supergoop sent this to me complimentary and this is my review.,2
I love that this face mist is actually a mist! It doesn't squirt in your face and leaves blots of it on your face. It applies evenly and the smell is to die for! It's very refreshing and hydrates my dry skin. I hope fresh comes out with more nectar stuff.,0
"I love that this is supposed to be a primer and setter in one. Genius! However, not so much. People say it's transfer-proof. Nope! By the time I got home it was all over my crewneck sweater. Also, I was oily and it was coming off by 10:30am when I applied it at 8:00am and I have combo skin. I love the idea but this was a miss.",2
"I love that this mask comes in an opaque bottle with a pump as opposed to in a jar where you have to scoop out product every use. I feel this makes masking a less messy experience and wastes less product. This mask feels comfortable on the skin and after the 15 minutes it is supposed to sit on the skin, it doesn't feel overly dry or like it is pulling, as some clay masks sometimes leaves your skin. The one drawback to this mask is that it does have a scent to it and I would have preferred it to be completely unscented. Overall, after washing this mask off my face, I did notice that it felt softer and smoother. This mask is supposed to also instantly exfoliate and illuminator. I would say it was a relatively mild and gentle exfoliator. I didn't necessarily notice my skin appearing to be more radiant and brightened right away, and think it would take a more prolonged use to see those kinds of effects!",1
I love that this mist is truly a fine mist. I've had some that just wet your face. This didn't make me feel like I needed a fan to dry my wet face. I also like that I can use this fine mist as my toner. I have normal to dry skin  and being able to hydrate my skin before my primer helps my foundation stay on better. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.,1
I love that this product has an spf in it. Ir makes me feel great that I am protecting my skin. The application is very easy it just glides on. I also love the bottle and how the product comes out onto my brush. This is a fuller coverage than I am used to but I do not mind. I would reccomend to anyone.,0
"I love the color and sparkle of Wildside. It's beautiful on it's own or as a top coat. The minty tingle is fun and the scent reminds me of Andes Candies after dinner mints. It's just a little more thick and goopy than is comfortable, so I find myself blotting a lot.",4
"I love the color and texture of this nail polish. I would call this more of a chrome purple/pink than straight-up pink, but it looks fabulous. This is my first purchase of this brand, and I am definitely going to buy some more.",3
"I love the color, and the puff applicator is great. The only thing taking it down to 4 stars from 5 is the scent.  It's supposed to be peach but to me it smells like banana which is a huge deterrent for me.",0
"I love the color and thought the smell was decent and was super excited to try it. I have acne prone skin but it had been clearing up of scars and active acne. Within the 2 weeks that I incorporated this into my skincare routine at night, I finally started to realize that I had fresh breakouts, even on my neck where I never breakout. And the smell of the oil became annoying to me. Had to return.",2
"I love the color, finish and coverage but it made me break out. I really didn't want it to be the foundation since it looked so good, but after eliminating everything I narrowed the problem down to this product.",2
"I love the color of this blush and loved the color on myself.  However, I bought twice and both times the blush cracked and broke apart.  The first time there was a small flaw in the blush when I received as I ordered online.  After taking it on a trip in my cosmetic bag, it was completely shattered.  The 2nd try I dropped it on my counter and the blush shattered.  So, I can't repurchase even though I love it.  Perhaps they need to provide in a thicker case.",3
"I love the colors in this palette.  I don't use much eye shadow but stalked this and intended to use it all the time, as the colors are perfect for making green eyes pop.  The mattes in this group are nicely saturated, a little gripping when attempting to blend, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The shiny shades, however, need extra product and careful placement, as they do not blend well at all.  I have worked hard to get the colors to play well together but the foils resist settling in without a struggle.  And after a day at the office, all of the shade fade.  They don't crease so much as FADE.  I have tried all kinds of layering and bases, even my foolproof cream eye shadow under 'baked' powder shadow. sad.  I will keep this and keep working at making this palette work as the colors are amazing.  but meh on performance.",3
"I love the color, size and cost of the brush but the bristles are way too soft!  I didn't feel I got any product on my cheeks when I used it.  It's now living in my ""nice but don't use and can't throw away"" drawer!!",3
"I love the colors of the palette as I am very fair with light eyes.  However, they apply with tons of fall out, no color payoff, and they do not blend well.  The eyeshadow is not long wearing.  I even went to the store to purchase with my rouge rewards because it was out of stock on line based on all of the positive reviews.  Never again.",2
I love the colors. They're not super pigmented where they go on easily. I had to work at it - really build up the color.  But once they're on they're lovely. I didn't experience any fall out like some of the other reviews said.,4
"I love the color, the color payoff, and the feel of this lipstick.\n\nBut the smell...oh, Lord, the SMELL.  when I initially applied it, it smelled like a wet, musty carpet.  I previously returned a gloss and primer because of that smell, but this color is just too pretty to send back.\n\nif they could do something about the smell, this would be my 5-star, holy grail nude lippie.",3
"I love the contents of this spray, unfortunately the spray nozzle leaks and doesn't give a good fine even mist. I have used it a little unconventionally by spraying it on my brush when blending out stick foundations and I have loved using it that way. So if it wasn't for the packaging I would have given it 5 stars. I received this product complimentary for my honest review.",0
"I love the coverage and feel of this foundation.  It makes my skin look flawless even at the end of the day.  HOWEVER, and this is a big however, I can't seem to find a shade that works. There is something strange about the undertone, and just when I thought I found a shade that matched, I took home a sample and when I applied it the next day, it oxidized within an hour and my face is now orange.  Sephora also refused to give me more than one sample.  I had previously tried 4 different shades in store and they all changed colors within an hour.  it would be great if they could give more than one sample on this foundation because it oxidizes.  it's difficult for me to take multiple trips to try the shades one at a time (and still can't find a good shade).",4
"I love the dewy  and soft finish this spray gives me. I love that it is packed with great clean ingredients. This spray is really great to refresh your makeup, just gives your skin a burst of hydration and awakens tired stressed skin. I am using it when I am on my computer, in time we shall see the benefits.",4
"I love the Dewy Skin mist but it tend to make me a little greasy looking throughtout the day. Thats why I thought this would great. Unfortunately the spay is chunky, not a fine mist, so it tends to land more in one place on my face than the whole. The formula also clogs constantly which is so annoying. Also feels really drying and tight on my skin. I'm returning it.",2
"I love the double sided brush; it combs through my  lashes without flakes and clump free. Lengthens and adds volumes when used as directed. Wears all day but washes offs easily.  I love that!!  Most important,  it is non-toxic and cruelty free.",4
I love the double Wear foundation and thought this will do magic for me but unfortunately it was super hard to blend and the more I tried to blend it on my forehead the more it crumbled up and looked super heavy and drying. I still have it and will use it during summer for its SPF but it's not my favorite and I wouldn't repurchase it nor recommend it.,2
"I love the feeling of this cleansing balm. I've used others that leave my eyes cloudy when removing eye makeup but Slaai didn't affect my vision at all, even being effective removing waterproof mascara. My skin doesn't feel oily or overly dry, just clean and healthy.",4
"I love the feel of this mist and ever since i started using it, I feel it has helped my moisturizer absorb so much better. It is the perfect mist for all around the face. Although, when you spray it, it's not long enough to be able to cover the face. I have to do 3 sprays: 2 to make an x and 1 for my chin cuz I feel driest there.\xa0Also, I have a big face so you have to take that into consideration. It has lasted for 2 months with everyday use, 2x a day. I was gifted this by @biossance with Jenn Im at the Feb Beverly Hills  event in CA.",4
"I love the finish and colour of this blush! It is a true cream to powder. It's easy to apply by hand or by stippling brush; blends out like a dream and without patchiness. This blush is a true peach, not coral peach (which I love, but already have so many). The colour is very complimentary with my Asian yellow light-medium skin tone; brings colour to my face in a natural way. This blush lasted well over 8 hours on my oily skin.",1
I love the formula and actually don't mind the packaging but it's too dark for me? I literally start to turn orange after 10 mins regardless of what foundation I'm using. Wish there was a white/colourless option for super fair people.,0
"I Love the formula. It's smooth, pigmented, stays all day, but isn't too soft or waxy. The only issue I have is with the purple. Its gorgeous going on and is a rich, royal, bright purple, but only after a couple hours the purple starts to fade. By the end of the day it looked like a dark charcoal black with almost no indication of ever being purple. Not the vibrant gorgeousness it started as. That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. The brown is excellent!",1
"I love the formula of these liquid lipsticks so I had to get this new shade. I'm a little disappointed that the colour is way darker when you apply it to your lips, it almost looks black. It's also slightly patchy, but adding another layer fixes that. The formula is the same comfortable plush matte finish. I just wish the colour looks the same on your lips as it does in the bottle.",0
"I love the formula of this bronzer but couldn't find a shade that works on my skin tone for the life of me. I have light skin with olive undertone and at this point I tried all the shades on in store. The diffused bronze light has reddish undertones, luminous and radiant have more orangey undertones, and nude bronze is probably the closest I was able to find to a natural looking bronze shade on me. It is still very warm but a lot less orange based than the others. The formula on this is divine. It is shimmery but doesn't deposit any visible sparkles on the face. It just makes the whole face look bronze and glowy. If you find a shade that works for you, get it. HOURGLASS, PLEASE MAKE MORE SHADES!!!!!",0
I love the formula of this lipstick. Its definitely on the list if lipsticks that are long lasting. I wore this all day and touched up once after I ate. They apply smooth and the texture is creamy. With these you don't need a lip liner but I still use one but if you wanted to wear them alone you definitely could. The lipstick also smells so good.,0
"I love the gloss bombs and have tried all of them besides the clear one, this one is my favorite though! I love it so much i need them to make it permanent. This is also my favorite highlight shade I've tried by fenty so far. Great set, especially for the price. Need a restock asap so I can get everyone one for Christmas!",1
I love the idea behind this product as it's an all in one. However I was shocked as to how much product there actually was. I twisted the pencil all the way up to see and it's not even 1/4 of my pinky. I love the shade it matches my brows perfectly and is not too harsh. I'm still working in growing out my eyebrows and this product worked great and is buildable. Unfortunately once I run out I won't be repurchasing due to the cost and how much product I'm actually getting.,4
"I love the ingredients, the formula is thick and hydrating (a little goes a long way), and the scent is fresh and mild. I wear it at bedtime and wake up with the softest skin. I've had no irritation or dry patches. My only wish is that it came in a pump.",2
I love the Laneige water sleeping mask so I was super excited to try this one. I have mature dry skin and the winter months make it worse. After the first night of using this I seen a huge difference in my skins hydration. My skin feels plump and hydrated without being heavy on my skin. I definitely recommend this sleeping mask.,3
I love the lip mask in the tube. Love the potted one. HATE the mini lip balm. The mini is so soft that it mushed as I applied it and broke at the base on top of that. I might have to depot it just to use it because the more I use it the more it's ruined. I don't think I would buy a full size of it due to how soft the product is. The other two are worth it though.,1
"I love the lip mask, it's the middle of winter in Canada and I don't have chapped lips at all thanks to using it every night. I will definitely be getting more of that. The sugar scrub is nice too. I'm not a huge fan of the balm, though, I find it a tad dry and waxy. I have other ones I like a lot more.",4
"I love the luxe, gorgeous packaging and how the product is refillable. It’s super lightweight but hydrates well and applies well under makeup and other moisturizers.  \n\nIt has peptides in it to help firm up the skin. I haven’t been using it long enough to see the firming action yet but it definitely makes my skin softer and just better looking. No breakouts at all from this and I have acne-prone, aging skin. I received this item as a gift from YSL in exchange for my honest opinion.",0
I love the moisturising and lightweight feel of this product and am very impressed by the coverage it achieves all things considered.  Yes it's expensive but is sooo worth it - I haven't even used up all the product off the lid yet!,1
"I love the moisturizer,  second time buying but the tingling treatment and the serum made my face break out in an allergic reaction, luckily they are free in this box because the moisturizer cost the same",1
I love the products thats in this set. now my skin is acne prone so I don't know if it will change in a good way or a bad way yet but so far I enjoy the H2O moisturizer I put it on at night and morning before doing my make up. I'll update this after using them for 6 weeks but so far I enjoy them no burning or not hurting my skin to wear i have to wash it off immediately.,0
"I love the quality of Kat Von D eyeshadows - high-pigmented, they blend easy and stay on all day long, even if it's hot and humid outside. In my opinion, they're one of the best in matte eyeshadow segment. This eyeshadow palette is perfect for casual office makeup, or smokey eyes - for any occasion.",2
I love the scent of this cream. Ir is very thick and creamy. I use it everyday after shower and my skin is very soft . I have Eczema and psoriasis . This cream has helped me tremendously. One negative is that it takes awhile for it to absorb. You have to rub it in. I reccomend this to everyone . I received this for free in exchange for a review but opinion is my own.,4
"I love these blushes! They're very easy to blend and they're not too dry or too dewy, JUST RIGHT! I picked up sweet peach peony online but I wished I had gotten a brighter color instead too as this one is a little bit subtle. I don't really care much about the brush that it comes with as I use my own blush brush for blending. Nonetheless, I'm still keeping it!",4
"I love these brushes. they clean and wash beautifully without any loss bristles. They are soft yet firm enough to blend eyeshadows seamlessly and I love the sponge applicator for metallics, pressed glitters and shimmers. This pairs wonderfully with the new mercury retrograde palette.  I can't stop using these even though I have tons of eyeshadow brushes. These are very well made and perfect for travel. You won't need another brush when using these in conjunction with each other.",1
"I love these colors. I bought a smaller, similarly colored palette from Clinique years ago that's no longer available, and I missed the darker bronze colored shadow as well as the golds, and this one has them. It's hard to find these colors w/o either being to brassy OR not pigmented enough to last more than a few hours. I look good in the golds/metallics, but I'm also very fair, so it's hard to find the right shade that doesn't look too clownish. This palette checks all my boxes.",3
"I love these colors so much and especially that there are Metallica, glittery, and matte. A versatile, simple, clutch, and genuinely beautiful pallette. And the packaging is AMAZINGLY TRIPPY /BEAUTIFUL as well as sturdy . The eyeshadow is vivid, yet subtle, with a primer you can achieve more dramatic and glamorous looks, making it great for day and night.\n\nOnly con, which is always just a dream of mine, is that it came with a nice double ended brush.. But I wish every pallette did.",4
"I love these, especially the purple/blue shimmer. This is my go-to set when I want something fun but low maintenance. The lighter shade masks any imperfections and if something chips over the course of the week, it's not as noticeable as my normal shades. Has great staying power, opacity (2 coats), and the shimmer removes easily. The glitter shade isn't as duo-chrome as I'd like, and definitely needs a topcoat for easier removal.",1
"I love these! I bought them on a whim because I was on my way to a big trip and realized I had forgotten acne products. \nI do tend to break out quite often so I was hesitant to buy them since I've tried so many products. \nI was splendidly surprised. I used them on the plane and when I got to my destination, I literally did not have that bump anymore. It sucked everything out!!! I kept using them throughout the trip until I ran out but I will definitely be repurchasing soon.",0
"i love the selection of products included in this year's trunk and love that it came with a working mini fridge. but like most, i am a little disappointed that the interior is so small. everything has to lay down rather than standing upright. i also wish the shelf was height adjustable. but for it being included ""free"" i really cant complain. i love how it looks and that it is not super loud (its similar to the sound of a computer fan). i also love that they included a car adapter so you can use it in the car for drinks/snacks.",2
"I love these little lipsticks several colors to try out before buying a full size one. Yes they are small, but it was what I wanted, more choices to try out. They only complaint I have is when you open the lipsticks, BE CAREFUL! Can not stress this enough. The lipsticks stand above the case and you can easily nick them when opening them I really love bite beauty!",3
I love these mini palettes because they blend in easily and quickly.  The shimmers are just enough pigment that you don't need to pack it on too much.  It's a subtle dramatic look bringing a neutral look for a slight smokey eye glam.,4
I love these oil blotting papers! I work 12 hours as a nurse and by the 9th hour my t-zone looks like it needs some major skin CPR. It gets embarrassingly super shiney! I haven't been able to find a skin primer that works but these papers are a life saver. A quick dab ok my forehead and nose and most of the oil (and my stress) is gone!,4
I love these peel pad so much!! My skin looks so amazing after I use them. I started off using them every 3 days and now I use them every day. I love that it’s helping my other face products absorb better. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for brighter and younger looking skin. I received this complimentary but this review is completely honest.,0
"I love these so much, and have been so impressed with every Nails Inc. product I've purchased. The hot pink shade is so pigmented and bright that it is perfection - especially for a pedicure. My favorite shade by another brand was discontinued and I think this one is actually better. I haven't used the orange as much, but it's also a really fun shade (although it is a shimmer).",1
I love these so much! I prefer the glowy ones because they are similar to a lip balm but give you a light wash of color. They also are really light on the lips and very hydrating. The matte ones are okay but not my cup of tea. I feel uncomfortable with most lipsticks. For reference I need something that feels like Armani's lip maestro lipstick or else i just can't wear them.,1
"I love these, they are the only wipes that do the job without drying my skin\n  As for.the scent, it's not offensive and Ihow.long does it take to remove the makeup?  Less than a minute.  All you beauty wizards should know to use eye makeup removers for eyes.",4
"I love the SK-II Essence. It works wonders on my skin! The Amorepacific Time Response Eye Reverse Creme is absolutely amazing. Best eye cream I've tried so far. It's ridiculously experience, so I was excited to be able to get two C boxes. Everything else included is just a nice bonus!",3
"I love the smell and even tough It's not perfect, but it works fairly well for aluminum free deodorant.\nOn a regular day it lasts me though my work day and I usually don't need to reapply it. On a hotter/workout day I need another layer halfway though the day.\nIt goes on smooth and dries fairly quick. \nWhat I really like is that it doesn't turn my armpits dark.",1
"I love the sparkle.  Super fun topper.  What gets me is that I got 104, and 106.  The little jar for Blue-White has a shiney lid.  106, Grenny White, has a matte lid.  Clearly made differently as Grenny White decided it would be fun to burst open in my work bag.  I mean, glitter is life, bit that's just not cool.  lol.  That's what the 3 stars is for.  Great product. Crap packaging.  Btw, you may want to use a glitter glue.  I use Too Faced Glitter Glue.",1
"I love the texture of this foundation. It melts into your skin like it is a part of it. It offers coverage, but doesn't enhance texture or look heavy. It leaves a beautiful glow on your skin. I would say the coverage on this is medium, not full. But I'm ok with that! I love a good medium coverage foundation!\nWhat is really special about this foundation is that it leaves a glow but still dries down to the point where you don't have to set it with a powder. Even without a powder it wears all day. Because of that, I think this formula would work for multiple skin types.\nI love the color of this foundation! It is SO hard to find foundations that work with olive skin tones. And when I do, most of the time they are not what I'm looking for this! This is a perfect shade for me during the winter!\n The packaging is luxurious. I love this foundation! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",4
"I love the tones in this palette; however, I was not expecting to love it so much. I like the level of pigmentation offered by both the shimmer and matte shades. The shadows last all day on my eyelids and the vibrancy at the end of the day is impressive.",2
"I love the VV mini palettes, I found this one to be a little different than the others though. they still blend well but that red unfortunately faded. I did a full review on my yt channel but it's not the best or the worst .",4
"I love the way that this applies, it feels very light and natural on the skin. I received a small sample of this in a sephora play box. I find Tarte to be a very hit or miss brand in general and this one is iffy. I think I might just have the wrong shade because the foundation seemed to oxidize poorly on my skin and make me appear too dark/orange. I would be interested in trying a lighter shade with different undertones but I'm not sure if I'd be willing to spend the money on it for a maybe.",0
"I love the way the colors look on the cheek.  It gives such a beautiful pink glow.  I didn't realize how pretty it would be.  I did notice some glitter here and there, but it was not so terrible.  I would definitely repurchase this mini duo again, but wouldn't mind just a larger one or just get the Darya palette.  I really do love it and may purchase other colors in the near future.",3
"I love the way this essence leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. I have been using it in combination with the moisturizer, both which I received complimentary through influenster. It's light but leaves my face feeling quenched!",1
"I love this as a curler! so much easier to use than the ones where the handle sits on the cheek bone m, I can never get a good curl or placement with those but this was so easy and it's super pretty! and comes with two replacement pads!",2
"i love this as an under eye concealer. it is really light and doesn't dry out my eye area like a stronger concealer would. this doesn't work for covering dark spots, and for me it can rub off if I try to use it in oily skin areas, so it is perfect as a hydrating under eye concealer. I wear lots of eye liner and it doesn't seem to smudge it either!",4
I love this as my Base routine moisturizer. This is one of the only products that has fragrance but it doesnt hurt my skin. No breakouts or burning. I enjoy using this on hot summer days when im oilier and i dont want to have product on my face. My skin is smoother and has more of a glow from this product. Makeup looks and applys better. This is the first moisturizer Ive started using. If you have dry skin i recommend pairing with an oil or hydrating serum. This is what i do in the evening time when my skin in dehydrated. I like the gel cream consistency of this product. The formula is just what i wanted. I dont like cream or lotion like moisturizers. This feels light and soaks in instantly. Perfect for California days. I also love how this comes in a bigger size than most moisturizers i buy.,0
I love this balm but it is way overpriced . Its half the size of a normal lipstick. It's  a beautiful color and sheer not as much color as in the picture online . For the amount of product this shouldn't be more than $10-$15.,2
"i love this blush it really takes my makeup routine to the next level. Blush usually wears off quickly on me but adding this under a light wash of powder blush really does wonders for me. Like many others, I twisted off the cap.. i actually had this blush for months before realizing it was a pump design lol. WARNING: a little goes a very very long way!! you barely need half a pump for both cheeks. I normally apply mine with a fluffy buffing brush and i get a very nice finish.",0
"I love this blush palette! First of all, it's such a good deal for the price. Second of all, the colors are beautiful! I was afraid the very light pink shade wouldn't show up, but it looks great on my skin. The finish of these blushes is so natural and pretty. I would recommend this to everyone!",0
"I love this blush, this is my ride or die blush, my #1. For reference I'm African-American, my skin is dark so it's not always easy to find blush that's going to show well. It's a pretty rose color, the pigmentation is off the charts it's gorgeous on me. I am so glad I splurged on this.",2
I love this bronzer. I use it everyday and I haven't even put a dent in it! Super creamy and super pigmented.  I love the colour too! I dont know if I would day it smells like coconut tho... The scent isn't too overpowering,2
"I love this bronzer/self-tanner as a bonus facial product! It adds great natural color and lasts a few days if you use 2 drops, wouldn't really recommend more for a redhead. If looking for any   additional color, this is a great choice and most natural I have seen.",4
I love this brow gel. the brush is so thin that you can very easily control where the product goes. the color is perfect for me. it's not warm but also not grey. it kept my brows in place all day without that concrete feeling.,4
I love this CC cream formula a lot. It's easy to spread. It covers well. After 8 hours of testing without other products on top of it this still stay well on my face. The reason I gave a 4 stars is that the one I got is a mini size. But it didn't came with a pump like the full size one. It's kind of disappointing as that is such a great feature! I think this should be informed on the product description for consideration if anyone want to use just mini size.,1
"I love this cleanser and it's natural yet thorough exfoliating power!  It is just what my skin needed! I'm leaving this one in the shower to use several times a week versus by the side of the sink,  It's such an effective cleaner with great exfoliation that I don't need to use it twice a day just to cleanse my face!  It's a great size tube for the price too!",2
"I love this cleanser, especially when I double cleanse at night. I notice that my pores shrinks instantly and also my face is even more smoother and soft than before. Since I'm oily combo, id only use this during the winter time.",2
"I love this collagen! I got this as a sample for a review, but was looking for a collagen product that (a) was easy to use, (b) tasted great, and (c) wasn’t cow based. This hit all marks! The flavor is really great and I’ve taken it daily since.",0
I love this concealer. It wore beautifully. The color match was perfect. It was easy to work with. It made fine lines and wrinkles more diminished. The finish was natural looking. No complaints here. This is my new favorite,2
I love this concealer. My under eyes and the dry acne spots I like to conceal are usually so so dry and concealer would just cling to it in the most unflattering way. This concealer covers my imperfections and makes my face look fresh. It’s great on its on for the no makeup makeup look.,0
"I love this concealer. Sometimes I use a little under my eyes and sometimes I conceal as many imperfections as possible (which means a ton of concealer all over my face lol). It blends out seamlessly into my skin every time and covers my dark spots - and I'm a brown skinned African American woman that gets dark brown hyperpigmentation. It covers it with a skin-like finish. \n\nIn addition, if I don't have time to powder afterward, I'm good. I don't get weird creases in my eyes or breakup around my nose or corners of my mouth after a few hours. I went back to another concealer from a different brand a few weeks ago and I regretted it a couple of hours later - it creased and looked terrible. I'll stick with my MUFE concealer from now on. It looked so much better than the other brand I put on that it compelled me to write this review.",0
"I LOVE this cream! at first I was a little upset when I seen the size of the cream. It looks like a sample size for $39. I figured to just give it a try anyways. I dont care for the smell, and the size which is why I took away a star. But I will say a little goes along way! I have been using it day and night for about a week. I already notice a change in the dark circles under my eyes. They are not as sunken in and tired looking. It also keeps my eye area hydrated all day and makes putting my concealer on so smooth. My skin is also very sensitive and I had no issues. Over all its definitely worth the try!",1
"I love this cream! It feels very thick and creamy when you put it on but doesn't leave the face feeling greasy. My face no longer feels uncomfortably dry when I wake up like it normally does. When used before bed I have noticed that my skin looks better first thing in the morning. I don't have noticeable lines but it does look smoother and plumper, the few lines I do have are reduced. I have no problem wearing this under make up and haven't noticed it affecting the wear of my foundation at all. I will definitely be purchasing another one. \n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",1
"I love this cream! It's lightweight enough that I don't feel like I've got anything caked on right before bed, but still provides great coverage. Smells amazing, better than any night cream I've used before. I can definitely see the effects - my skin looks more relaxed and bright on mornings after I've used this cream!",4
"I love this cream!!!!!!!! leaves my skin really soft and feeling hydrated! thw only small downfall is that it burns for a few minutes after applying, this happens with the rose toner, and the deep hydration overnight cream.",4
I love this day cream. It’s lightweight and goes on beautifully. I love that my Day cream has a light tint. Mornings are easy. I use different serums before depending on my skins needs. I’m 48 and it’s the only coverage I use besides a concealer.,2
I love this eye cream. I actually had an allergic reaction to another eye cream and once that rash healed I was left with tons of tiny lines that weren't there before. A Sephora consultant helped me and she felt it was just dehydrated skin that was leaving those lines and recommended this eye cream to undo what the other eye cream had done and for moving forward. \nAfter 3 uses I noticed a significant improvement. Now a week later those new lines are almost entirely gone from this great moisturizing product. Also I experienced stinging the first few uses because of how dry my under eye was but now that has stopped. \nSuper happy. I have highly sensitive skin and am thrilled to have finally found an eye cream I can rely on.,1
"I love this eye cream! It is one of the first to not irritate my sensitive skin, and doesn't cost a fortune! Plus I can actually see a difference. I am obsessed with the results from this product and love the way it feels!",1
I love this eye cream. I use it twice a day and it's very easy to apply and not sticky at all.  It goes on very smooth and after only 2 weeks I noticed my fine lines were diminishing and the skin under my eyes seemed to have more elasticity.  I couldn't be happier and have definitely found my #1 eye cream.,3
I love this eye mask! I started using it I noticed that the puffiness and dark circles have disappeared! The applicator makes it really easy to apply the cream. It doesn't really smell like much and it is very light on the skin.,0
"I love this floss - it is the perfect thickness and grabs every bit of gunk. When I used invisalign braces, I had to floss several times per day after eating, before putting my aligners back in. I tried ribbon floss (too thin and it didn't seem to work), waxed flosses, (still too thin and weird wax residue) etc. I was at a spa and they sold cocofloss. I decided to give it a go. I will always use this product. It's perfect. I love that it is made with coconut oil and not some weird chemical ingredient. Yes, it is pricey, but such great quality. Why buy cheapo floss that doesn't work well (for me anyway). No one loves flossing, but this product makes it at least a bit more enjoyable. Like a spa treat for your teeth. Love.",2
"I love this for my dull , dry skin. I'm 48, use it ever other night alternating with my retinol emulsion. This gives my skin a smoother look and feel and brightening effect. I prefer this to Glycolic acid.",2
"I love this foundation/concealer. I goes on smoothly and just makes my skin look like a better version on itself. Does not look ""made up"" and has a very natural look while still evening out skin tone and covering imperfections.",3
I love this foundation. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation. It gives such a healthy flawless looking finish on the skin. It is buildable and doesn't look cakey. It is worth the high price tag. It is my special occasion foundation.,3
I love this foundation. I have dry skin and my makeup usually melts off halfway through the day. I pair this with Laura Mercier setting powder and UD All Nighter Setting Spray and my make up lasts all day. I also use FAB Primer.,1
I love this foundation-it helps that it is cruelty free but that is not what made me fall in love-it is so LIGHT!! This lightweight foundation makes you forget you are wearing make it. The colour match was also very close-as a black woman I appreciate not have to mix foundations to get my colour. it spreads so easily on my face and it LASTS! I wore it on Saturday to a spa- showered everything but my face after a massage  and it still looked that good! thanks Kat Von D for a fabulous foundation. Thanks Influenster for sending this to me for free to review!,2
"I love this foundation, it looks so amazing on. It is very watery and does need a good shake before applying it. I use a Real Techniques buffing brush to apply it. I have mature skin with huge pores but it doesn't settle in them or accentuate texture. I don't use a primer either. I use Sunday Riley CEO serum and moisturizer prior to application. This foundation looks so dewy on me. It is sheer yet it does blur out the redness in my cheeks. Initially I got the color wrong, or maybe the color isn't how it's described. I'm usually light sometime light-medium with pink undertones, pretty much the same as one of my favorite You Tubers Nic Chapman. She did a look using Light Medium 9 which is described as light medium with  neutral pink undertones so I decided to also go with that. OMG! The actual shade was about right as I had a tan at the time but it pulled so yellow on me, I looked like I had jaundice! After studying the skin color photos on the Pat McGrath website I decided to try Light 6 which is much better and is definitely for pink undertones. I have a slight tan right now so it's a little bit too light but once that fades it will be perfect.",3
"I love this foundation. I use 450, 445, and 440 (sometimes individually, sometimes mixing depending on what my skin needs that day) because my complexion changes throughout the year based on factors like sun exposure etc. I can wear this foundation to work for 9 hours straight with no touch up and still come home with a full face of makeup. With that being said, coverage is up to you- it is buildable and very natural looking. I have used a wide range of foundations from MAC, Lancome, Bobbi Brown, Origins to Covergirl but this is hands down the best. The only drawback is that it does not have spf. I use Clinique Pepstart moisturizer with spf and it works amazing well as a primer! I’m a product junkie but this combination is so good, I’m not changing anytime soon.",0
"I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION!! My all time favorites are NARS Natural Radiant and Too Faced Born this Way, but ever since I tried this, I have been using it literally everyday! It is the perfect every day foundation, it's lightweight, medium coverage, and leaves skin with such a pretty glowy finish. It has a super runny consistency and it blends out easily with a brush or sponge. It lasts super well all day long. I can't say enough good things about this product, I just ordered a 2nd bottle as back-up.",1
"I love this foundation stick! I start thinking I can try another, give it a little bit, but always come back to my one true love. This foundation makes my heart sing! So silky smooth, blends beautifully, covers nicely and doesn't feel cakey or heavy on the face. Two thumbs up.",0
"I love this gloss! Every single one of them! My only gripe is that it’s hard to swipe it around to get every last drop. I’m glad I got to try all of these, but I wouldn’t get it again- I’d rather get the full size",2
"I love this highlighter so much, it's such a perfect subtle color on light skin tones and great for an everyday look. But it's 3g for the same price of all the other 8g benefit powder boxes and I don't understand at all why that would be. I'm switching over to the new Tinkle one even though it's glittery for my taste and I prefer the Dandelion's subtle shimmer. I don't know what their reasoning is for this is but it makes absolutely no sense to me and I'm not going to repurchase.",0
I love this. I am a product junkie. I skip around looking for the next best thing. I will keep using this. I use it at night. I have oily skin and it is not too heavy. My skin feels great int the am. Smells delicious!,3
I love this! I am new to Glamglow. I got the gravity mask as a deluxe sample. It is by far the best I have ever used. other reviewers said it doesn't peel off. You have to put it on thick. I leave it on about 30 minutes. It does peel off. My skin looks bright and clear.,4
"I love this! I am olive skin brown eyes and this looks beautiful on my skin . I bought the 8oz. bottle and it lasted me a long time .loved the feel on my skin ,the scent was fine too. I was a sun worshiper but stopped sunning years ago .this product gives me the best color no worries does not turn orange. F.Y.I. I use moisturizer before applying and it blends evenly ,no streaks.",3
"I love this.  I bot this and i sleep better and i dont have bedhead in the morning and creases in my face.  i know some ppl wrote that when they washed it, they got rips in it etc but i used a gentle silk wash that i got at la vie on rose i use for lingerie and it came out same as new.  i dont advise putting it in wash machine i hand wash mine.  it is pricey but i found it worth it.",3
"I love this. I got to try a variety of new mascaras and now i have a couple new favorites. I already have and love the Benefit Roller Lash but now i also use the Milk one, the Sephora one, and the YSL ones religiously. If you're looking to try out some new formulas i would highly recommend!!! The only thing that i did not like was the lash because they are super huge and dramatic and not suitable for my small eyes nor my style.",0
I love this! I have many of KVD products and love them all. It is a great line. The shade of this matches my brows perfect. I used it to shade in thin spots and make my brows look fuller. You don’t need much. It will last for quite awhile.,2
I love this. I have never used an oil cleanser before but I got this as a Christmas gift and was excited to try it. It is so amazing. It cleans and removes all my makeup and leaves my skin soft and moisturized not tight and dried out like many cleansers typically do to my skin. I have super sensitive skin and I have had no issues.,4
"I LOVE THIS! I'm a little surprised to read some of these reviews, however I may be able to offer tips and context on my skin issues to possibly help someone else. I have combo skin, which has been becoming more on the dry side as I age. I have tried dozens (I'm not exaggerating) foundations and cc creams in an effort to see what works best and actually stays put throughout a long day. I find most foundations seep into any wrinkles (I don't have many, mind you) or slide off my face, even with primer. This, however, doesn't slide. it stays put and stays put beautifully. It truly is my skin but better. I start with fresh skin. Ladies, remember to exfoliate few times a week and always, always, always moisturize. I like to start this off with my favorite moisturizer and add a thin layer of The Ordinary's squalene. It gives my skin a dewy look. I apply this with a foundation brush. I have the IT Cosmetics brush (any good foundation brush will do). I dab product and tap into my skin. I loooooove the IT Cosmetics poreless powder on top. My skin looks dewy, hides acne, blemishes, discoloration etc and most importantly, stays put and fresh for a long 12 hour day. Love it.",4
I love this! I wasn't sure if it would work for me because I have combination skin with a very oily t zone but this worked so well at keeping it matte! I didn't feel any dryness on other parts of my face and all the other products I use went smoothly over it. Just need to shake it really well before using it otherwise the clay will slip out and become difficult to use.,1
"I LOVE this lip balm. It is CRUELTY FREE (most important- why should any animal be tortured for make-up?), it has clean ingredients, it's vegan, and it works! This wonder balm hydrates my lips at night and by morning, they are smoother and plumper. I also use it in the morning under my lipstick as a primer and throughout the day for a moisture boost. (put the leftover balm from your application on your cuticles). I will check out the rest of their products from this amazing brand. Thanks Biossance!",1
"I love this lip mask, especially during the windy NYC winters, so when I ran out of the original berry, I decided to try the vanilla. Unfortunately, I don't like the scent/taste as much as I had hoped.  It does have a slight vanilla scent but underneath, it almost smells and tastes like plastic. I've used it a few times and it's the first scent that I'm not a fan of.  Both the berry and green apple versions are great and neither have this plasticky flavor.  I definitely recommend this lip mask but not the vanilla version and I think I'll be exchanging it for the berry.",2
"I love this lip mask for nighttime use. I put it on any night my lips are feeling dry and it stays on all night, moisturizing my lips. Particularly in winter with the dry heated air, this stuff does wonders to stave off chapped lips. I rarely use it during the day but that’s not what I bought it for. True, the product is difficult to squeeze from the tube, but it’s performance outweighs that defect.",3
"I love this lip oil! it is really hydrating and feels great on the lips! This oil is not sticky st all, which is awesome and makes it very comfortable to wear. I really like how glossy it is. Anything with cannabis oil in it is great, and I enjoy this product a lot!",0
"I LOVE this lip oil, I use it day and night after I've exfoliated all of my dead skin away to rehydrate and revitalize my lips. They've never looked this good, my lips look super plump throughout the day and night, I've been told I look like I have bigger fuller lips and have been asked if I've gotten fillers/tattoo fill ins, but no, it's seriously this product.",0
I love this lip set. The color pay off is amazing and the liquid lips last forever. The only reason I am not giving this set 5 stars is because two of the liquid lips don’t work for my skin tone. But otherwise it is great. I received this product complimentary from Influenster to give my review and opinion.,0
I love this lipstick! It's a beautiful bright red and it's so smooth and silky on the lips. It doesn't dry at all! the color looks beautiful on brown skin and it is well pigmented. I also really like that the lipstick does not bleed,0
"I love this little bag! It's the perfect size to put 2-3 beauty blenders (unsquished) or maybe even keep it as a little purse on those days where you just need something to throw your keys, chapstick, and ID into. I am definitely buying at least one more when they come back in stock.",2
I love this little beauty! The packaging is so travel convenient and the gloss gives lips a beautiful shine. It is not sticky or uncomfortable to wear. I love how hydrating and smoothing it is. I strongly recommend this!,2
"I love this little duo. I thought the one color was red, but is more of a sienna or burnt orange, which is just fine with me. Both colors are great fall colors and the lighter color is a good neutral for any season. I really like to way the tops open as well. Clever.",2
I LOVE this little duo palette SO MUCH!!! Every time I have worn this duo my husband has complimented me on my cheeks looking beautiful and glowy. My Morphe E4 blush brush fits perfectly and ABH highlighting brush fits great too! Highlight doesn't emphasize my pores or texture.,2
"I love this little palette and it quickly became my most used go to choice. the mattes blend out so easily and the shimmers are gorgeous,  especially the bottom right gold, which is the most stunning gold I've ever seen imo.  definitely hitting pan soon.",1
I love this loose powder because it really does take away the shine but not the glow! As I've gotten older my go to loose powders started emphasizing the fine lines on my skin. I like a slightly more satin finish to my foundations but other powders either take away the finish or make me sparkle in the sun like a Twilight character. This is perfect for setting my foundation!!\n\nThe amount of product you get more your dollars is an excellent value and I'm so glad I got this for Christmas! The packaging is less than ideal but it also helps me not waste as much product.,4
I love this mascara.  I have always used just an OTC brand because I thought all mascara was the same - but wanted to try a better brand based on a sample I had used from Sephora.  I bought this brand and am in love.  It lasts all day until I take it off in the evening. :),2
"I love this mascara.  I have thin, short eyelashes and this is the most volumizing mascara I’ve found.  It clumps a little when I keep layering it but not if you don’t apply too many coats.  This was like a better version of Diorshow for me.",2
I love this mascara. my lashes become extremely volumized and give the effect of fake lashes. it is definitely one of the best mascaras I have tried. you do need to put it on carefully or else you will smudge it. I received this free for testing purposes but I have purchased this in the past and due to the primer I will be purchasing it again,1
"I love this mascara since it focuses more on thickening than lengthening. Only needs one coat! It stays on well unless it gets wet, so it's easy to remove at the end of the day. The mini size lasted around 3 months of daily use. Would get again for sure!",0
I love this mask because it does exactly what it says! My skin was so smooth and bright after just one use! My make up went on better and looked better too. A great surface to put make up on especially if you struggle with dry skin. I would highly recommend this to those who want brighter and more even tone skin.,1
I love this mask! I don't use it as a rinse off mask but as an overnight sleep mask. I do my normal routine and use this last and my skin is so soft and supple the next morning. I have fairly sensitive skin with combo skin and its difficult to find clean brands that work and I recommend this to everyone.,1
"I love this mask! I love masks where I can see the impurities poking through and getting sucked up. It leaves my face feeling so smooth and flawless. My skin is sometimes dry so it gets kind of hard to apply with just my fingers so I get them a little damp for easier application. I am definitely considering buying the big bottle of this! I also like how there is not really a smell and it’s very easy to remove, just need to use water.",0
"I love this mist it has a light fresh scent. The bottle is amazing quality and the mist is a fine mist unlike other sprays. It is so refreshing on your face, and moisturizing. Made my skin so smooth and soft all day long. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.",0
"I love this moisturizer, bought this set to try it for the first time and I'm in love. Such an amazing deal too, you're basically getting the eye cream and cleanser for free. Will definitely be buying the cleanser full size.",4
"I love this moisturizer. Entering the winter my skin was drying up. So i decide to get this cream and it has done wonders. My skin is hydrated and smooth. Makeup looks flawless. Natural glow,not oily or shiny. Will recommend this product.",1
I love this moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and am able to use it daily without breakouts. It's also helped to clear up redness caused by dry skin - I haven't been able to see my freckles so clearly in years! I'll definitely be a repeat customer for this item.,1
"I love this moisturizer. My skin is always very dry, I have tried so many different moisturizers and nor worked until now.  I love this, at first I only used at night. But I sometimes use in the day, it works great under makeup.  This will now be my go too moisturizer, and the price point is great.",3
"I love this. My 9 year old is getting interested in makeup, so these soft shimmer shades are perfect for her to play around with. Yes 9 is young, that's why this is great, you can't tell too much that she applied it ;) They all have a soft pale tone.\n I kept the other items for myself, the mascara is amazing, my lashes look so FAT, in a good way.",2
"I love this! my kids call it my ""blood mask"" and it definitely looks dramatic when applied but that kind of adds to the fun. do not leave it on any longer than advised or you WILL regret it. this is a wonderful tool for regular maintenance and it is super affordable so extra bonus!",4
"I love this oil, great on my dry skin, I wake up each day to glowing skin! I started also using it during the day, it works beautiful under my foundation.  This is my third bottle, so happy it was included in a Sephora play box way back when, or I may not have tried it!",2
"I love this oil! I have very dehydrated skin, and it instantly soothes the itchiness, and replenishes the moisture. Make sure you put their HA moisturizer overtop to lock in the moisture all day. The only thing I don't like is the smell, but It doesn't stay on the skin for long and for the quality and price it's definitely worth it.",0
"I love this palette! ABH never disappoints. I received this palette free for review from Influenster. The pressed pigments are so impressive, especially shade C2!! Gorgeous! These colors are so versatile and playing around with them was lots of fun. The formula is very smooth, minimal fallout and the pigment lasts through my 12+hr shifts managing a BBQ restaurant, especially when I use the ABH eye primer",4
I love this palette! All shades are gorgeous and apply beautifully. The shades stay on my lids all day with absolutely NO creasing. I can use this palette every single day and can create eo many different looks with it. 10/10 would reccomend!!,4
"I love this palette as an everyday, quick, and easy eyeshadow palette. The colors are blend well and show up nicely on my skin tone. The colors are buildable and you can intensify an eyelook without having to go into another palette. This palette is neutral perfection and travel friendly!!",4
"I love this palette! I always use neutrals and taupes for my everyday make up. I want something that's barely-there, just- enhance-my features kinda look. This palette fits my needs. While I thought it doesn't apply as smoothly as UD Naked...you need some patience blending it out. But for the price I think it cant be beat. And it stayed on me for at least 10 hrs. Mind you, you have to go to the store to see the actual colors coz it doesn't look like this on-line.",3
I love this palette! I don't have the original one but this extra spicy palette is worth it. Every shadow is pigmented although some of the shimmery shades are dry when you feel them but they still apply great on the lids. The shadows are also not too chalky therefore no fallouts.,1
I love this palette. I picked this gem up mainly for the shimmers as I think they're pretty unique. As always with ABH shadows this palette is pigmented and the shadows blend almost effortlessly. I do wish the palette had a  matte blue instead of the matte purple but I won't hold it against it lol,1
"I love this palette! it's a perfect neutral for my medium/tan skin and hazel eyes. mattes are amazing and the shimmers are beautiful. the only reason I'm giving four starts is because you need to use your fingers for Luna and a couple other shimmers to get the correct payoff and application. after I figured it out, I'm in love. worn it every time I put on makeup since I bought it.",1
I love this palette. Its easy to work with and blends out perfectly. The package is nice and worth the money. I can make many looks from this to work and nights out. I did receive this for free in return for my honest opinion from influenster but I will be buying another shade range for sure,1
I love this palette.  it took me some time to figure out what worked best for me. but once I did I loved it! try dipping your brush in water prior to dipping into the shimmers.  once you do that you really do get the molten effect and it is stunning! I also received this item from influenster so for that i am greatful!,1
"I love this palette!  I've also been watching You Tube videos to try and get the looks I love so much but for some reason, I just can't seem to get it!  As for the fall out some people complain about, I can say you touch the pan of color lightly to pick up a little color which goes a long way and tap the brush before applying and you won't have the fall out on your face as others describe.  It's all in the application of color.  I look forward to experimenting with this more than most of my other palettes and, I have many!  Beautiful colors!",2
I love this palette so much! I hadn't intended to get it but I saw a few looks and I just needed it. This was my first purchase from this brand and the quality is awesome. The shadows are pigmented and very easy to blend. I know some people had issues with Sabrina but it worked fine for me.,1
"I LOVE this palette!  The colors are beautiful and highly blendable.  Many people commented that some of the colors were too peachy; I actually like this bc I was unable to wear the Too Faced ""Peach"" palettes and was looking for something with similar shades.  As always, great product from UD - would definitely recommend, if you like warm peach and pink colors...",3
I love this pallet the shadows are amazing for the holidays they're soft blend well no matter what your skin tone is light medium Olive deep these colors will show up on you the only thing I don't like is the bronzer which it's gorgeous so was the formula I just like the bronzers from her other pallets this one's more warmer I enjoy it more neutral bronzer because of my fair skin tone but other than that the blushes the eyeshadows the highlight is amazing this is the best all-in-one travel palette it's luxury it's beautiful it's everything !!,3
"I love this pencil. The green one was a miss, but this turquoise one is perfect. The pigmentation really stands out and it goes on nice and creamy but still has control enough to do fine lines. Ignore any imperfections in the liner; my hand was super shaky when I was doing it.",0
"I love this powder. I have dry skin and have struggled the last couple of years with powder bc they all looked cakey. This one lasted all day long, locked in my face makeup and made it last!!. I recieved the product complementary for testing purposes. #lauramercier #loosepowder",2
"I love this powder! It doesn't settle in my fine lines, doesn't dry my under eyes and smooths my pores to almost invisible. I'm in my mid 40's and refused to use powders because its drying and settled in my wrinkles but I got this in my Boxycharm box and sooooo happy i did! I will def buy this when I run out! if you're over 40 and have fine lines and stay away from powders and setting your concealer and/or foundation, you have to try this! since they offer a mini size for $19.99, you can't lose!",3
I love this powder.  It works so well with this foundation in the collection and is finely milled. I like the flawless finish over my foundation. I don't feel it looks cakey or powdery at all. love it!!,3
I LOVE this powder. I use it every day. I'll even dust it on when I'm wearing no other makeup with just a little blush and mascara. It just makes the skin look so pretty. The only reason I'm taking off a star is because I wish they would come out with more of these 3 pan palettes. I use radiant light the least. I've hit pan on the other 2. There used to be an option on the hourglass website where you could customize your own palette and choose the powders you want for a couple extra bucks but I don't see that option anymore. Also when I bought this palette it was $62 and now it's been increased by $2. This is the most expensive makeup purchase I have made but I don't  see myself going without it now. Its definitely a 5 star product but I wish there were more choices in this design and I don't think the $2 increase was necessary.,1
"I love this primer, I first found through my Ipsy Glam Bag. I am someone with combo skin, hydration is really important to me and this is a very hydrating, and sticky primer. It kind of feels like a moisturizer going on, and while it doesn't do anything for filling my pores, it does stop dry flaking skin from showing through my makeup and the stickiness helps keep my foundation perfectly in place. I've been using it ever since! love.",0
"I love this primer so much that I repurchased when it during the Rouge Sephora sale. It's become my go-to primer and is now the only primer I actually use. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and my foundation stays on until I remove it. It does feel slightly tacky when applied, which for me helps my foundation stay. Even when I sweat, my foundation doesn't slide around on my face.",2
"I love this product. After washing my face, I use Witch Hazel toner everyday. Once I began to use Alpha-H I saw results. Every other day instead of using Witch Hazel, I instead used Alpha-H and immediately saw results. I wash my face at night with a Biore charcoal bar and use Alpha-H as toner before applying a moisturizer. Literally the very next morning, my face felt and looked smoother. Any blemishes I had were not as noticeable. They were reduced in size and redness. Overall, I recommend this product and you will see results immediately (even if its small). If used consistently result are better. I'm excited to keep using this product and see the progress that is yet to come.\xa0\n\nI received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes",4
"I love this product already. My skin felt amazing after one use, and I'm already seeing an improvement in my face. My pores are minimized and I feel fresh! I received this product complementary for testing purposes.",4
I love this product and every one of The Ordinary's products I've tried. My skin appears brighter and smoother than it has in years. I'm 41 but I didn't develop acne until my mid-20s. My skin is currently mostly oily but definitely more prone to larger pores and shine in the t-zone. It's also temperamental and sensitive in the drier areas. So finding a collection of such powerful products that really work at such amazingly low prices was fantastic! I currently use the Lactic acid 2-3 times a week.,2
"I love this product! As I have gotten older my  rosacea has become more noticeable, plus my skin has become dry. This product not only doesn't dry out my skin but it helped my rosacea become almost non existent. I have tried so many products high and low price and this is by far the best. Plus it doesn't have harsh chemicals.",4
I love this product but I think it's too heavy for day wear or during the summer so I mostly use it at night/during the winter. It leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. it also reduces redness and irritation. I usually have to resort to putting cocoa butter on my face during the winter but not when I use this. I recently purchased some for my grandmother to try and she also loves it.,4
"I love this product especially with the colder dryer weather approaching. I went into sephora explaining how my face has been getting dryer and hurts when i go outside. She quickly recomended this to me and i have to say it has helped my skin tremendously. The first use i noticed a difference, especially when applying my makeup. . No more dry patches! The only negative is that farmacy makes it seem this oil is fast absorbing but, in my opinion it definitely needs time to absorb...other then that it has been a life saver!",0
I love this product except for the smell. The fragrance is so strong that it makes me nauseated. Even though I loved how it looked I had to return it because I simply could not wear it. The fragrance is so incredibly strong and off putting that I literally can not comprehend how anyone is okay with it.,0
"I love this product! have been using it for 3 weeks, once a day and the results are great! I have large pores and it helped me soo much!!! I was told that my face looked with foundation when I had no makeup, so that's a huge step for me.",4
"i love this product. honeymoon glow packs a punch so i only use it twice a week at most. the formula is hydrating and comfortable in comparison to other exfoliating serums I have tried. Originally I bought the ordinary lactic acid 10% but I found it to be irritating as soon as I applied it, and I have also tried drunk elephants 12% exfoliating serums witch was great but not hydrating enough for my combo skin. in conclusion ( after 2 months of use) find honeymoon glow to be soothing and effective.",4
"I love this product! I apply 2 drops directly (i have read of others applying it with moisturizers) onto my face. One week made a lot of difference! My freckles are lighter, skin brighter, pores smaller! Like magic! This is the first skin care product from Clinique that I tried,",1
"I love this product. I basically use it as a base. It makes eyeshadow go on smoother and it adds color as well as it helps shadow to last longer. I never use it alone unless I'm going somewhere brief, because it doesn't last long on its own. However it helps to improve any eyeshadow that you put on top of it and I also use it as a lipstick base, and as blush so I create a complete look. I tried several different multi sticks and this one is the best as far as how smooth it is, and pigmented and also because it really works for multiple uses I purchased it in numerous colors.",2
"I LOVE this product! If you have an issue with redness, this is for you. I have never been the type of person who can leave the house without foundation and not feel self conscious the entire time until I found this product. It is very thick, but works into your skin very well. I've worn it under my foundation, as well as on its own. All you need is a tiny bit of setting powder if you are prone to getting oily (I am), and you are good to go! Takes about 2 weeks to notice, but it is a life saver!",0
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have been searching for a great peel for home use. I previously worked in a skincare clinic and I wanted to find something that gave me clinic results. I have tried many but just wasn’t finding it. This is it!  It took me a while to finally buy it even after all of the wonderful reviews because it is expensive. So I have been keeping track of the number of uses I got for $80.  Well it’s been once a week for 26 weeks and it’s still pumping out product.  That means I am receiving a clinic style peel for about $3 each. Unreal. Ok so enough about the price. This gives me results. I’m 52 years old. My skin is smoother, clearer, and it glows. The age spots are fading. I cannot say enough about how much I love it.  Drunk elephant is now my Friday night date every week!",3
"I LOVE this product. I ran out of it last winter and didn't restock because the pumpkin smell to me was too fall-y, but I regretted it within weeks. This cleans my skin so well and gives me such a nice, fresh glow. I typically use it once a week. My routine after working out is usually to wash my face, put on a mask, and sit in the steam room, which is a bit different than most directions will say, but this works well for me because the product really gets into my pores. I am a big Summer Fridays girl, and this is one of my all time favorite masks!",0
"I love this product. It far surpasses my expectations, which is hard to do. It glides on and it makes my face look flawless. My makeup stand fresh throughout the day. I highly recommend YSL Top Secrets Instant Moisture Glow!!!",3
"I love this product. It is a good starter kit if you are learning to contour, etc. Also, the highlighter is a beautiful copper-y pink champange color. You can opt to use all 3 (highlighter, contour, and concealer ) to get the ultimate chizzled look or just highlighter and your concealer for a natural look.",0
"I love this product! It's a gentle exfoliater so it doesn't feel like you're rubbing sandpaper across your face, which is definitely a good thing. Recently started using only MURAD products and I must say, my skin has never looked better.",0
"I love this product!! It's exactly what I was looking for to go under my makeup everyday. I'm allergic to most sunscreens yet this one has ingredients that didn't trigger a reaction. The texture feels like a moisturizer. It DOESN'T leave a white smear, unlike most sunscreens. And there's no scent.",4
I love this product. Its not too heavy and keeps my skin moist all days.  I was using the REN evercalm moisturizer but by the middle of the days my skin was drying out and fine lines galore.  I'm wearing this under my sunscreen and it keeps me dewey all day!,0
I love this product! It’s very soft and has a pleasant smell. I use it all over my eye area and can also be used before moisturizer if you’d like. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple. Definitely would purchase!,0
I love this product. I was recommended this product by Emily at the Rideau location and I'm happy she did. This works super fast for my acne prone skin. I've tried other products and compared it to this and instantly went back to this product. It's pricey but Emily give me a good suggestion which was try to use it mainly on the problem areas or spot treat any pimples I may have.,1
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out. The dark circles under my eyes immediately looked 20x better! Plus it smooths your under eye. It feels like just enough moisture, not too light but not too heavy!",0
I love this product.  Pay attention to all the advice you see on this site about starting with a very small amount and wait a couple days to see how your skin responds! You can increase your frequency once you know how your skin reacts.,3
"I love this product!! Really brightens up the area around my eyes, if you don’t want to pack concealer under your eyes but still want to look brighter and more awake this is your solution , I want to point out that this is by no means a concealer, it will not really cover anything BUT it does brighten up the area really well and I can see a huge difference when I wear it. I’d say this is for someone who doesn’t want to put a lot of makeup on but at the same time wants to look “fresh” and awake.",0
"I love this product so much! I don't find it does much on its own (though a blast of this is lovely on a hot day), but it definitely makes my other skincare so much more effective. I use it to sooth my skin after a glycolic acid toner, and it makes my skin soak up my facial oil (Phoenix Cell Regenerating facial oil by this same brand). It also helps my morning serum be absorbed. Plus it feels so luxurious! I will definitely continue to repurchase.",2
I love this product. The texture is so light and refreshing. It’s amazing under makeup. I noticed that it leaves me skin dewy and hydrated. I love the glow that it gives me and how it brightens my skin. I am a big fan of Summer Friday’s. I use all of there products and it’s a staple in my daily facial regimen. Day and night.,1
"I love this puff and don't know how I lived without it until now! It smells like heavenly cotton candy. It's not a harsh smell or overly sweet either, just enough. The glitter is fantastic and didn't take much effort to get out of the puff. I am constantly complimented on the fragrance. Ladies... this is a MUST HAVE in your beauty arsenal!",2
"I love this roller!  Feels cool and stays cool no matter what the temperature is.  The mini size is great ... I don't feel I need a bigger one at all for my face.  So relaxing to roll it over a clean face ... I have seen other reviewers say that they use it with serum but I am a little nervous to do that ... I feel like the quartz is porous and will absorb the serum.  Anyways, I love it and think it would also make a great gift.  I only took off one star because the wheel can be a tiny bit squeaky when rolling.",2
"I love this serum. I feel like it really made my skin look more youthful, fresh and healthy. I love that it didn't have very much scent to it. I also liked that you can use it all over, even under the eye area with no irritation and amazing results. I didn't have any issues with it feeling sticky. I definitely saw a drastic difference in the appearance of my fine lines especially under my eyes. I could really tell the difference when wearing concealer, my undeye situation has improved a lot. I will say that this product is quite expensive, and I recieved this product free for review purposes in exchange for an honest review, but the results seem to be well worth the price and I definitely think it will be worth the repurchase.",2
"I love this serum. my skin tends to lean toward the drier side of normal, so I try to use some good hydrating products. In addition, I'm going for a serious preemptive anti-aging routine. Add all of that together, you get a routine that's packed with super moisturizing products. (besides sunscreen-ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN!!)\n\nI added this serum to my routine about a month and a half ago, and my skin feels all the more moisturized since I've started using it. It really adds that extra oomph of moisture to an already moisturizing routine.\nthe best part is that I didn't break out or have any sort of reaction...and my skin breaks out from EVERYTHING, I promise you. \n\nIt goes on a little tacky, but once you pat it in a little and wait for a few minutes, the stickiness goes away. I use this after morning and night after cleansing and applying my two toners, but before my moisturizer. It feels like it locks in the moisture and my skin feels super soft!",4
"I love this set and have been using all of it for days, it's perfect for the holiday season.  Fortunately I had saved an old Dior eyeliner brush for the eyeliner that stays put.  The eyeshadow also stays in place without shimmering down my face by the end of the day.",2
i love this set and I'm so glad they came out with it for the holidays. 3 different flavors/scents. as someone who suffers with dry lips if i don't use moisturizers. i dunno how one or 2 people are saying it doesnt work or makes lips worse.  my lips have been so soft moisturized and supple since i got this set.  i use it all day everyday.  it lasts pretty long even after drinking and a few hours i can still feel the moisterizer On my lips.  may not be super glossy anymore but i can still feel the formula. i love this and this will be my survival kit thru this cold weather,1
"I love this set.  It's a great value and a,great way to try these products.  I use the UFO oil daily and the Saturn mask and Martian toner twice per week.  My skin looks,great. One tip about the Martian toner, I dot it on my cheeks, forehead and chin then spread it with a cotton pad.  there is,less waste that way.",4
I love this set so much. I was going to buy it at full price but it went on sale so I grabbed it. I wanted to try every one of these. So for me the price was bonus. The lipstick is exactly the shade I was looking for. Muted dusty rose sort of sepia almost. I'm pleasantly surprised about the VV eye topper. pigmented enough that I'd wear it alone.,2
"I love this set so much, they're part of my morning routine. Last year, I started to experience dry skin and redness and I tried different products but it was just getting worse. I found these products last month and I noticed a difference right away. After the first week my face started to look more healthy.\n\nFor an oily skin, I only recommend you the Serum because the other 2 products would make your face look more oily.",4
"I LOVE this setting powder. I wasn't sure about it at first. it felt hard to get on the brush and do anything. but after using it over and over I've realized how amazing it is. you don't need A lot of it to set on your face, which I wasn't used too, but realized I Love that.  \n\nI have dry/normal skin and this powder doesn't make my skin look worse.  it's light and doesn't mattify but keeps my skin looking natural. I used more flowy foundations and it doesn't take away the flow and sets my foundation perfectly and also helps my other powder makeup go on flawlessly. my makeup always looks PERFECT for hours because of this powder. I will rebuy this again!",1
"I love this shade, I almost picked 202 but I'm sooo glad I ended up with 203. \nReally flattering and opaque on the lips! It's moisturizing and doesn't try out my lips, I do see a bit of a stain after which is perfectly fine! This is a good shade to dab on the lips if you don't want to put too much product.\n\nI also purchased the sheer counterpart of this lipstick which feels more like an everyday balm. Both are very office friendly (in case anyone was wondering lol) not super red or pink. \n\nThe case is also really pretty, there is some weight to it and the design is very 1920's!",1
"I love this shadow by itself or added as a topper to a silver smokey eye. The eyeshadow glitter adheres well without a glitter glue as well, but mind fallout. This eyeshadow was a smooth texture despite the glitter. The packaging is also cute.",1
"I love this sleeping cream.  I have combination, acne prone, aging skin.  I was worried that this cream would be too rich given some of the reviews.  I am happy to say that this cream is light and absorbs very well into the skin.  It also leaves a very slight and pretty sheen to the skin that I really enjoy. This cream is not very scented at all. I will definitely repurchase again.",3
I love this sleeping mask. A little goes a long way. I bought the small size after trying a sample. It's smoothing and brightening. The smell isn't too strong and I'm sensitive to scents.  I took away a star because I feel there's more packaging than product in this heavy glass bottom jar.,4
I love this so much. Thank goodness I received a sample so I knew how amazing it was. I am 39yo and have minimal forehead lines and wrinkles around my eyes. My mom is 70 and has deep eye lines. This has greatly helped us both not mention give our skin moisture. we use it every night before bed. Totally worth the money. It only takes a little product so it will last quite awhile.,2
"I Love this SPF. I'm on my second tube about to order my 3rd. I've been looking for a moisturizing sunscreen that doesn't feel oily but is thick enough to feel like there's something between the outdoors and my skin. This gets the job done and my skin loves it. I have combo skin on the dry side of things. I consider it my holy grail of sunscreen, I was using the tatcha one but I tried this one on a whim and haven't looked back",0
"I love this sponge. I wasn't expecting much, and forgot I'd even bought it, until I had a BB mishap. It works great! I love the shape with the different edges that make it easy to use for not only foundation but also contour and baking. It doesn't absorb anymore product than my BB does in my opinion and for the price, I ordered 2 extras!",2
i love this spray for my nightly routine. it is very soothing and calming to my skin. i spray before my moisturizer and also as the last step in my routine. the spray of the bottle is a nice mist. but at the end of my other bottle it started to squirt instead of spray. bottle could use some work.,2
"I love this spray! I first got it in the best sellers set and thought it would be nice in the colder months when my skin is drier and sure enough it is! I spritz my face several times and stay dewy for hours. It smells clean and the nozzle lets out a very fine mist. I definitely plan to keep a bottle in stock at all times, especially winter. Try this!",0
"I love this spray. It does have a strong scent, but it gets the job done. I'm a nurse and when I use the spray my makeup doesn't move, even after a 12hr shift. If you don't mind the fragrance then I would highly recommend this.",2
"I love this stain! I bought it kind of on a whim in stores when I was killing some time, and figured the shade looked like it would go well with my skin tone and for the size and price, it was worth the risk even if it sucked. I'm so happy I picked it up because it truly is my new go to lip color. It doesn't last all day for me, but it lasts for several hours (five to six at a time I'd say before I need to reapply) and even as it fades, it leaves this lovely pink flush to my lips so fresh or faded, it looks gorgeous. It's non drying which is always my biggest wish out of stains and something I think is super hard to come by, so between that and the color being straight up STUNNING, I'm never looking back. Give this one a try, you will not regret it.",0
I love this stuff! After ordering the mini I realized I had another one I had not even used yet so now I have a spare! This keeps my brow hairs where they belong and does not make them feel stiff or greasy. Does it come in colors? That is the only thing that could make this better.,4
"I love this stuff! After two months of nightly use, I'm noticing that my fine lines are less noticable, my undereyes are less puffy, and my eye area overall looks less tired. I do apply a face moisturizer over this and it keeps the area adequately hydrated and moisturized (as opposed to no eye cream and just a face moisturizer). This will be the first eye cream that I ever repurchase.",2
"I love this stuff and was surprised by the mixed reviews. First, this is not a lip balm, it's also not described as one. Anyone expecting that or for it to remain on your lips for an extended period of time will be disappointed. \n\nIt goes on like a balm but melts into something like an oil (it's not oily, it's just the best descriptor I can come up with). \n\nit absorbs into your lips, as it should. You won't feel the product beyond a half hour or so BUT your lips will feel softer and smoother. Think of it as a moisturizer for your lips. Moisturizer absorbs into your skin and does its job, so does this. \n\nI have super dry dehydrated skin and this time of year (winter) I practically want to rip my lips off. I'm also knocking on 40s door and have noticed my lips looking less smooth (especially with lipstick). This stuff does the trick! I love how it feels when I first apply it and while I miss the slippery feeling once it absorbs my lips do feel so so good and look much smoother! Its saving my sanity this winter. \n\nDo I still use a lip balm at times? Yep. But mainly because I like having that feeling on my lips, I don't feel a dire need to apply balm throughout the day when I put this on in the morning. I also love how this wears under lipstick (especially liquid or matte), it provides a really nice surface and a buffer to keep your lips from drying out. \n\nI'm honestly not sure how I ended up with this product (subscription box? impulse purchase? no idea) but I love it and inspite of the price will be buying again and again.",2
I love this stuff. Have been using it for well over a year and it is a staple in my daily skin care. My skin is lost without it. It leaves it hydrated but not oily and it doesn't break me out. Plays well with other moisturizers and makeup and smells soooooooo good.,1
"I love this stuff! I don't really notice any plumping effects, but it feels really good on my lips and keeps them moisturized. I've been using it a lot this winter, and haven't had any issues getting chapped lips.",4
"I love this stuff! I have oily skin, but I really try to hydrate it with effective products that aren't heavy on the skin. this product is perfect for that. it's beautiful under makeup and has really helped my skin be more even and supple.",4
"I love this stuff! I purchased this spray hoping that unlike all the other  hundreds of products Ive tried on my ridiculously oily skin, that it would work and I must say it did! time after time I tried it with different primers and foundations and it kept me from looking oily. HOWEVER, for the price... it's a ridiculously small bottle. In less than 3 months I went through 2.5 bottles. while I love this product, I'm praying they make a value sizes bigger more reasonable priced version. For the summer sale, I was forced to try another product that provides more product for the price point. if you can afford $30 a month for makeup definitely buy this. if you're like me and trying to maintain a reasonable budget don't even try it, because you'll be sad once it works and you run through this product.",4
"I love this stuff! Moisturizing, covers well and feels light, perfect for everyday use. I don't need a heavy foundation daily, I try to save the full coverage (Estee Lauder Double Wear) for evenings out, this is a great  option for daily wear. It is moisturizing for my combo, mostly dry skin, and evens out my Fair, neutral skin tone (I wear Vanille 1N2). It also sets well with the Laura Mercier powder. I do pair with the Laura Mercier concealer in 1N and love the combo of all 3 products. Just looks like perfect, healthy skin! not made up or cakey, fakey at all.. \n\nps. I didnt get a freebie, I actually paid FULL price for this and have repurchased it! I highly recommend!",2
I love this stuff. My daughter gave this to me after I had told her that I felt like my skin was looking less vibrant and more dull. I do not use foundation so my skin looking good is important to me. I use this after cleansing and it brings the glowing vibrancy back to my skin.,3
"I love this sunscreen, great for sensetive skin and has great spf protection (PA++++). Giving it 4 starts instead of 5 because of the price, it's pretty expensive considering you'll go through this pretty quickly if you apply the right amount of sunscreen needed to protect your face. Otherwise, I love it!",4
I love this sunscreen. I been shopping for a physical spf since chemical ones have ingredients not to be used when pregnant. This was the only one I could find that didn't leave a white cast on my skin. For reference I am a NC45 complexion. Only downside is the price but it worth for sun protection and not to be looking casket ready.,1
"I love this sunscreen/moisturizer. I have dry/combo skin, and I tend to want lower maintenance, so I was looking for a moisturizer-sunscreen hybrid so I could avoid an extra step in my already involved K-beauty routine. It's perfect for days I want to go without makeup and let my skin take a breather, and it also works as a solid primer for my everyday makeup (I'm a BB cream kind of girl). The reason it gets 4/5 instead of a straight 5 is because of the container. The print on the sides comes off on your fingers after repeated use, and subsequently on your face. I find I have to open it super-carefully, which is annoying. Which stinks, because the container is admittedly pretty and nice. That being said, I'm still going to be loyal to this, because the product is honestly that great.",1
"I love this! The coverage looks like your skin but better! It gives a dewy glow making the skin look fresh and it doesn't settle in my pores or lines. It does have a weird smell which is not unpleasant and it does linger for a while. This doesn't bother me at all or detract from the product, but may affect people who are sensitive to scented products. So far I have not had any trouble with the roller ball either, I click the applicator until the product shows and that does me for my whole face.",3
"I love this toner because it's super inexpensive, provides a hint of moisture to skin rather than drying it out like so many other astringent toners, and helps to calm redness/reduce puffiness. It doesn't have the purest and most organic ingredients (again, it's very inexpensive), but it doesn't irritate my skin, doesn't cause breakouts for my very oily acne prone skin, and just feels really soothing. It smells like rose, which I love too. It's also a good makeup setting spray too for when you're face might feel a little tight after putting makeup on. Solid product, no complaints here!",0
"I love this toner!!! Immediately after applying my skin looks more radiant. It is not just a nice, shimmery glow like a lot of great glow products are; it gives a healthy looking glow - which is the sexiest! The combinations of acids might be intense for someone with super sensitive skin, but it's not bad at all for those of us who are less sensitive. This is now one of my staples, not easy for me to say that!!",1
I love this toner . it is very  hydrating and lightweight on the skin . my skin feels super soft and hydrated after the application . it is also super gentle . I apply it into palm of my hands and directly to my skin . I love it,4
"I love this types of color and this one is no exception. It's so comfortable to use, my lips feel they're hydrated and soft. This formula is amazing. I love it. I wish it was a permanent shade instead of a Limited Edition cause I'll be using this a lot.",0
"I love to mix this with my Isle of Paradise tanning drops at night. They work wonderfully together. When I use in the morning, my skin is less oily throughout the day because my skin retains moisture, therefore doesn't produce oil. The Dr. Jart+ Radiance Serum is wonderful as well.",4
"I love to try out new products, but find myself returning back to this concealer consistently. I have very dark under-eye circles (thanks DNA!), and tend to need full coverage options. However, as I age and am given the gift of fine lines,  I find that most concealers start to crease and settle into these fine lines. This concealer is one of the few that do not. When I prime and set, the application lasts all day and well into the evening. I also use two shades--#2 for under my eyes,  and #3 for the odd blemish. Both shades are wonderful. I definitely recommend giving this a shot.",2
"I love to use a face mist during the day as a refresher. This mist is designed to help protect skin from the blue light on computer screens, so it not only helps with refreshment but also protects! I love the ingredients, the mist is super lightweight and doesn't leave any weird residue or anything. It smells really nice too. It's reasonably priced too!",1
I love trying new products especially mascara.  This one was so dry and clumpy!  Is it old?  If I hadn't thrown the box away I would have returned it.  Flakes all over the place and goes on in big black blobs!  Will stay away from this whole line.  Much better products out there.  Tube is cute-maybe that is where the money went??,3
I love UD lipstick and this was so cute i couldn't not get it. The colors are nice the red is my favorite as i think it looks the best on me but i really think for the price you get a good amount of lipstick.,2
"I love using Big Monsieur by Lancôme but this one is way better. The wand looks strange at first but when you're applying to the opposite side, it allows you to easily apply mascara without any extreme angling required on your part. The mascara is creamy but dries quickly and is not clumpy. I chose this mascara because I needed some waterproof (I have very oily and warm eyelids so most mascara end up smudging) and I need something for that wide-eyed look (I have very long lashes already but they are very straight. So I curl them with my Shiseido curler and use this mascara to ""set"" the curl which stays all day. I am very impressed with Lancôme mascaras.",0
"I love using this after the foaming clearing face wash. It can sting a tad. When using all over, don't squirt in hands then rub in because it dries too fast and you will lose product. I recommend squirting some on back of the hand, and using a few finger tips at a time in targeted areas.",4
"I love using this blur stick now that I discovered less is more! When I first used this, I applied too much and it caked on my face and my face became very oily in less than 30 minutes. But, when used in moderation, it doesn't make my skin oily and my skin appears smoother. I love how my skin has this subtle glow (Asian tanned skintone) after applying this luminous blur stick on my face and neck so much that I stopped wearing foundation!",2
"I love violet voss palette and this is a great everyday palette. all the shades wear well and mix and match beautifully. the shades are pigmented, blend beautifully and wear for 12 hours easily with primer. you cant go wrong with this palette or any other palette by this brand",2
"I love vitamin c, and my skin can handle a lot of it, but it HAS to be formulated right. This is definitely it. Basically a perfect all in one serum that gives you that instant hit of glow and hydration for a long lasting plump, dewy complexion. Also is definitely one of the best smelling viramin c serums ive ever tried and will be running to purchase a full size when im out of other vit c!",0
"I love Volition’s Snow Water Serum. No irritating ingredients or fragrance, and a little goes a long way.   It works great for my highly sensitive skin and helps reduce my redness and inflammation. I use this after applying Moon Juice Beauty Shroom Exfoliating Acid Potion (the only exfoliating product that I have ever been able to use without causing a rosacea flare-up). My last product is Farmacy’s Honey Drop Lightweight Moisturizer. \nThis combination has been a Godsend to me! I no longer ‘have’ to wear foundation to cover redness and blotches. In fact, I haven’t worn foundation in over a year. For those with rosacea and/or sensitive skin, I know you’ll understand that freedom. It took me many expensive years (both confidence and money) of trial and error to get to this place and I’m SO happy to have found this product.",3
"I love water moisturizers so I was super excited to get a sample of this in one of my kits/sample bags. It's both the perfect weight and perfect texture, and although I didn't have enough to see if my dark spots vanished like others claim (I guess it takes a month) it certainly nourished my dry winter skin like few other products can. I'll be buying the full size for sure!",4
I love what this product did for my lashes but I felt like the tube dried out quickly. It is slightly buildable and it does not flake. I would recommend buying the mini because it dries quicker than other formulas.,0
"I love what vitamin c does for my skin, so I splurged on this after reading positive reviews.  It did literally nothing but break me out. It's the only product I've ever returned to Sephora.  After being severely disappointed with their lactic acid, I will never be tricked by this expensive cheap brand",1
"I love winky lux lip balms. This is my third. This one has the lightest effect which is exactly what I was looking for. The watermelon is a darker pink this one is a hint of pink with some shimmer and I love it, very moisturizing too!",3
"I love Youth to the People as a brand and I use other products of theirs. I wanted to love this spray but unfortunately I can't. It makes my cheeks feel like they're stinging every time I use it, and it makes my redness worse instead of better. The negative effects aren't horrible but they don't make for a nice experience either. I'm sad because it sounded so great. I left on one star because the mist is so fine and does feel luxurious at first, and I think this might work for people who don't have skin sensitivities.",0
"I love YTTP products overall, but this is a letdown. If you want bang for your buck get their yellow goji berry sleeping mask, that thing is awesome. I keep using this, thinking it's going to do something, but it never does. I use it when I'm bored and have the time and have nothing else to do with my skincare. I'm just trying to use it up so I don't feel like I wasted a ton of money.",4
I'm 19 and i have the most sensitive skin. I could never use moisturizers without them irritating my skin. I tried this one and it immediately felt cooling and smelled amazing. Within the span of a week my skin was soft and suple. I also saw a change in some of my dark spots when i used the Vinoperfect Radiance serum. I've been using the moisturizer for the past three years and i keep repurchasing.,3
"I'm 36 y/o mom with acne prone Combo skin.  I have tried soooo many eye creams the past year it's my latest obsession.  I have dry, chicken skin, bluish, puffy under eye bags.  They're more puffy in the morning and especially if eating too much salt the night before.  I've tried kiehls avocado cream and that didn't do anything except sit on the surface, but improved dryness for just a couple hours and did nothing for texture (chicken skin).  I've tried Estee lauder recovery complex eye cream and that just didn't do anything.  I've tried KORA eye oil and that gave me oily eye balls.  I've tried the FRESH tea eye cream (moisturizes) and that actually did something but not as good as this cream.  I've tried Sunday riley and that doesn't moisturize but it slightly depuffs and illuminates undereye area (but I won't repurchase, too expensive without enough benefit). I like the korress 3d pine eye cream bc it does depuffs (better than Sunday riley and fresh ) but doesn't do anything for moisture.  AMOREPACIFIC does all I need!  it provides moisture!  it depuffs! it makes chicken skin disappear over time.  it softens the dark under eye circles (without illuminators).  this is super expensive (my opinion), but so worth it!  I will have to minus 1 star bc the container is a freaking joke.  I hate the jar it comes in and it will make u lose some precious product amount bc of it!  fix the upside down opening of the jar!  I will only buy during Rouge sale!",4
"I'm 39 with sensitive, combo skin, slightly oily t-zone and sun damage/fine lines. On the positive side, no reactions including redness,  irritation or peeling, but after using for a month no noticeable difference either. The consistency is jelly like and needs to be shaken/stirred or it separates slightly with some liquid on top. At first it felt like it would sit on top of my skin, but rather quickly it sunk in and no problems with pilling or residue on my pillow. The smell was a little too artificial for me, but faded and wasnt noticeable as I fell asleep. I'm very sensitive to fragrances as well so that was another positive. I do get occasional breakouts when introducing a new product that's too heavy for my skin, but no problems with that either. This may work well for those looking for a light, nice smelling mask and perhaps younger skin. For my skin it was probably equivalent to using a light gel moisturizer at night.",2
"I'm 39 years old with a tzone that can get oily. I was using the Glow Recipe Watermelon mist to take away the powdery-ness of my powder foundation, blush, and highlighter, but while I had a nice glow, I had to constantly blot my tzone. This Tatcha Satin Skin Mist leaves me with truly a satin finish. It doesn't leave me dry and matte like oil control sprays. It leaves my skin with a satiny glow rather than an oily glow.",2
"I'm 42 and tend to get wrinkles around my eyes. I've bought MANY eye creams over the years (Shiseido Benfiance, Estee Lauder Night Repair, Ole Hendrickson Banana Bright, etc). But none have performed as well as Biossance Omega Repair Cream. It moisturizes and smooths over my wrinkles so my skin looks younger and is ready for concealer to be layered on top. Also, I use the rose oil in this set when I want to have that ""glowy"" look on other parts of my face. I put it under my moisturizer (even though the directions say to put it on top). I have oily skin but the rose oil doesn't make it too oily. The Marine algae. cream does nothing for me, unfortunately, but the set is still a great value for the other two products. Plus, Biossance is cruelty-free! I highly recommend this set.",4
"I'm 50 and it seems my hair is getting thinner at the top and the sides.  so I concentrated on those areas with the serum.  I'm through perhaps half of a bottle.  I have a sunroof in my car, always drive with it open.  so I noticed all of these flyaway short hairs from my ponytail the past week.  realized today it's my hair breaking off perhaps 4inches from my scalp.  I had been noticing my pony tail seemed really thin.  the only thing i have changed in my hair routine is this serum.  so my conclusion is that for whatever reason its causing my hair to break off.  additionally my hair was long, about to my bra strap.  now it's just past my shoulders with out a recent trim.  needless to say I wont be using this anymore.",3
"I'm 63 years old, and this is my perfect masque/scrub. I use several serums and an oil,  and this is a great addition. When visiting my local Sephora, a skin care specialist recommended this product, when I asked for a better product than Dr. B. 5 oz, using 2x a week, I can't think of a better option! Five to 7 minutes twice a week makes my skin brighter and smoother!",4
"I'm a 45yrs young hispanic woman with combo skin, & eyelids seem to always be more oily especially by the end of the day. Also I live in L.A, Calif. & since I was a kid have always run really hot which makes me able to sweat at the drop of a hat. Sooo, lately I've found it much more difficult to find a mascara that doesn't bleed under my eyes giving me racoon eyes or have the stamping effect on my top lids after wearing it all day. Not to mention all the while giving me the basics we all look for in a mascara.(i.e vol, length, no clumps etc.).\nWhile this mascara did deliver what it advertised, it simply didn't work for me b/c it kinda irritated my eyes. Even though it wasn't flaking, It gave me a slight burning sensation. Also upon using sephora waterproof eye makeup remover, I found it to be a bit difficult to remove, thus causing my under eye feel like I'd wake up with tiny scratch scabs. \nAll n All, though this mascara didnt work out for me personally..it did wear well, gave my lashes length & vol.  didn't flake with no bleeding(racoon eyes), & no clumping. Wasn't a dry or too wet formula & didnt take long to dry after applying. \nhope this helps... \nOh!  and this review is not an influencer nor did I receive any type of gift or promo to write this review. Just my very own experience.",3
"I'm a Becca fan, and I had my eye on this palette for a while before I bought it. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I love it! Each shade is subtle, warm and glowy without being glittery, which allows you to use a light hand for a natural look, or build the colors for a more glamorous look. On my fair skin the berry shade works well as a blush, and all the colors work well on eyes and cheeks. Very versatile palette, I would definitely recommend this - especially to those who don't want to buy a ton of individual products or want a speedy makeup routine!",4
"I'm a big fan of dermalogica but it can be pricey and some items are hit and miss for me. This product was definitely a hit and I will repurchase when it runs out. It is a bit pricey for a cleanser, I get it, but it's quite large and I only use one pump each time. I also have sensitive skin and this has some powerful stuff in it so I only use it about 3 times a week or else it is too drying, which makes sense as it is an exfoliant and you do not want to overdo it. Anyways, I found this really makes my skin feel clean, there is an instant brightening effect as soon as I wash it off, and if you use it regularly/consistently you will find it does help more than most products that claim to fade spots do!",0
"I'm a big fan of Marc Jacobs lipgloss, especially the opaque formula. I love the glitter too, but I feel like there sooo many glitter glosses out right now that it's easy to find a great one. The Hi-Shine Gloss Lip Lacquer stands out among all of the  opaque/non-glitter lip glosses. These have tons of pigment - they don't just give off a hint of color. I only took a star off because of stickiness, which doesn't bother me that much but it's good to know if you really hate a sticky gloss. But I think the texture of it is what helps it stay on a lot longer than other glosses! Want Me? was the exact color I was looking for - a very pastel light purple-y pink that gives off some 60's mod vibes when paired with a matte black cat eye.",0
"I'm a big fan of this eye cream. To me, the consistency of the cream was spot on and the peachy color was a nice touch for my complexion. I used it on top my Supergoop's unseen suncreen, applying it with the tip of my finger, and found it to blend well without leaving a greasy mess. I appreciated that it did not have much of a scent and agree with many of the users that a little can go a long way. I would recommend starting with a very small amount to avoid the gumminess mentioned by other readers and also agree that this product may not be for everyone. For me, however, I liked the extra layer of spf protection and will add it to daily routine.\n\n*I received a free sample of this product for an honest review.",1
"I'm a bit confused about this: the shade is called ""fall feels"" but what I got in the mail was called ""caramel apple"". the shade seems to be the same (or pretty close to it) and the package seems identical, but why the different name?!\nalso, all my other paint pots are pressed, but this one is a loose powder?!? why?!? \nthe colour is beautiful, but I'm confused about it",2
"I'm a bit of a skincare junkie, and I've tried everything. I have decent skin, but I do have milia under my eyes, and I like going without foundation. I've never seen anything work this well, this quickly. After the first use I couldn't stop touching my skin because it was so soft and clear, and 3 days later I'm still foundation free. I didn't find it to be irritating at all. It's not cheap, but its cheaper than getting a peel at a salon, and works better so far than any salon peel I've had.",2
"I'm absolutely in love with this palette!  The formula is great and soft, the color payoff is BEAUTIFUL and this collab with Jackie Aina is honestly one of the best decisions ABH has made!  Every single color is beautiful and the richness is EVERYTHING!  Seriously, even some colors are so great that even a camera doesn't do it justice.  Definitely one of my favorite palettes.",1
"I'm a crier. Much like an infant, it is my natural response to all emotions. Happy, sad, tired, stressed...anything can provoke a brief, unexpected crying jag. \nI had high expectations for this mascara, considering how spendy it is. I wasn't terribly impressed with the results in terms of how it made my lashes look, but the true test came this week, when life's stressors got to be too much, and my tear ducts spilleth over. \nLength: okay. Volume: meh. Drama: ish. Water resistance: NOPE. \nSo, we know it's not waterproof. But in some cruel twist, it's also kinda hard to remove- not just from my lashes, but from the skin from lower lashlines to clavicle. It took some scrubbing with my Bi Facil. \nI'm glad this product got a test run over my sink as I did the dishes, rather than in the bathroom at work. Or a funeral. Or...when the party's over.",4
"I made the decision recently to remove a brand from my skincare routine once I had run out of each product and the eye cream was the only product that was giving me pause. Cut to nervously trying this beautiful formula eye cream from Farmacy and never looking back. I wish the product was in a pump, but it's a beautiful texture, absorbs perfectly and I still feel hydrated under my eyes by the end of the day. A little goes a long way and too much will end up spreading farther than you might have intended an eye cream to go. But can't recommend it enough. My concealers apply over quite will but I rarely wear makeup so I have tested that minimally. The texture is perfect for me, I don't like too rich a cream but don't like a gel. This seems like a light cream with maybe a hint of gel? Whatever it is it's beautiful.",0
"I made the mistake of picking up a travel size Hourglass blush about three months ago and got hooked.  I waited to pick this up until the fall sale.  It's exactly what I expected.  The first deepest shade is the perfect bronzer for my fair skin; the incandescent (middle) is a beautiful, subtle, non-sparkly illuminator; the first offers a soft warmth.  Once I discovered these and did some research on the amazing interweb, I really wanted the unlocked palette.  By the time I realized it was re-released, I missed it on Sephora but found it elsewhere.  It's amazing, too.  Hourglass does a beautiful job on powders -- they don't feel heavy and aren't remotely drying on already parched skin; they impart a healthy, non-sparkly glow (but I can't speak for the strobes).  The other beautiful but setting powder is the CT compact.  If you're fair, dry, desire a glow without glitter, I can't recommend Hourglass enough.",3
"I'm a first-time Huda purchaser (for myself) and I was excited about this product. always love sample-size products so you can see if it's for you over a period of time. In the beginning, the colors were working it for me and they stayed vibrant for a decent amount of time before needing to reapply. The lip set is more like a lip gloss turned lipstick that lasts longer. Problem: over the past month or so I've noticed that these have a scent that is VERY off putting. Now it's a challenge for me to put these on my lips without gagging and that isn't a good characteristic for a product you put on your face (or anywhere on your body). Too bad :(",1
"I'm a huge fan! I have always suffered from red/uneven skin the Dr. Jardt Cicapair products have been a game changer. I put this on every night after I wash and tone my skin, followed by the Tiger Grass Cream. I've been using the product for about 2 weeks now and there is a noticeable difference in my skin.",0
"I'm a huge fan of DE, have been using the minis for the last few months. This set is bomb!!!! What a great deal and the mini fridge is sooo cute! I keep my eyecream, retinol, and vitamin c in the fridge!",0
"I'm a huge fan of most of the Hum products, and this is no exception.\nAs others have mentioned, it is not the best tasting, but man does it make me feel great and full of energy. I mix it with vanilla almond milk and some fruit as I am good to go. Seriously, the taste only lasts a minute, but the energy boost lasts for hours!",2
"I'm a huge fan of the Farmacy brand and I use the mask and melting cleanser religiously, so I was excited to try this serum.  I've been using it for about a month now and while the smell and texture is great, there is absolutely no noticeable improvement in my skin.  I have since switched to the Sunday Riley CEO Glow oil and it has been wonderful for my dry skin.  The Farmacy serum would probably work for someone who is younger (I'm 51) with less sun damage and only needs minimal brightening.",3
"I'm a huge fan of this product! the texture once it's put on is amazing, non greasy, subtle scent, and just overall I feel improves my skin. I have combination/oily skin that can get drier in the winter and I feel that this serum evens it out really well!",2
"I mainly only use this as an eyeshadow palette, and I love it! I get a ton of compliments, and I haven't had any problems with it. My friend actually just got me another Freestyle Highlighter Palette so now I have 2!",0
"I’m a lip balm addict! I spend way too much on it, so I feel like I know a thing or two about what products are good or not, since I’ve tried them all. I really like this product. I’m almost done with my first tube, and I’m planning on buying another. It has a bit of a sticky texture; personally, I need that to feel like it’s working and that it lasts. If that’s something that bothers you, this may not be for you. It has a light fragrance (like roses) that I really like. It moisturizes like a balm but looks like a gloss. This is very moisturizing while still looking a little nicer than a regular chapstick.",0
"I'm a lip product junkie and I love this gloss.  I like hydration and long wearing color, so I tend to layer on lip products.  I'll put on a liquid lipstick on first and then layer one or two glosses over it for that comfortable feeling and a little shine and sparkle.  This gloss is a fantastic topper for my lips and my lipstick technique.  The smell is delicious--like mint chip ice cream and the sparkles are beautiful but wearable for work.  The price is fantastic compared to other high end glosses such as Hourglass or Nars and there's a good amount of product in the tube.  I liked the doe foot and didn't have any trouble using the gloss.  Love it!  Highly recommend!!",4
"I'm a little disappointed. This eyeshadow stick goes on nice and smooth, but after only a couple hours, it starts to crease, crumble and fade, and the tiny flecks of shimmer pile up under my eyes. Use Lancome Ombre Hypnose Stylo if you want a perfect, 20+ hour long lasting eyeshadow stick that never flakes or creases. This one doesn't come close to comparing. It's average. And the color isn't very flattering on me. Meh.",4
"I'm a little torn on this one. The product is lovely and has a beautiful colour but for a multistick this is VERY small. It's smaller than the average lipstick - I actually thought Sephora may have sent me a trial size by mistake! At the current price point, I think you could find a better multistick.",0
"I'm all here for multitasking products; especially eyes, lips, AND face.  I wanted to love this palette.  I hope they reformulate.  The colors are nice enough but it's VERY difficult to get the color to deposit and it doesn't layer well.  The more you build up, the more slippery it gets; patchy.  The formula is putty like but not moist enough.  The shadows are domed and crumble easily without easy repressing ability.  Lancome, please try again.",1
"I’m a long time insomniac. Without any “help”, it can take me 4 or more hours to fall asleep. This stuff will put me to sleep within an hour. I had to knock off a star for the nasty taste. It’s palatable for me in almond milk with a packet of stevia. \nI like the mask. I use Retin-A and it dries out my skin. This mask has reduced the dryness and my face feels soft in the morning.",3
"I'm always weary of trying new eye creams as I've had experiences where the eye cream would cause an excessive amount of white dots to appear (clogged oil glands) and they're super annoying to get rid of. This eye cream does not do that for me, it's thickish consistency but absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy. I use it as a night cream but have had no issues using it under make up as well. Since using this product religiously, I haven't had any dry scaley under eye skin even with winter upon us in Toronto. I already purchased a second jar.",1
"I'm a newbie to Nails Inc, I'm a cheap nail polish girl which results in me never painting my nails because they never last. Nails Inc Nailkale line has blown my mind. I threw out all of my cheap polish and have slowly started replacing with all of their products. no chipping and nail nourishing for my ""used to be fragile flaky nails. I'm obsessed with the forest green color.",1
"I'm a pro makeup artist and was so stoked when I received this palette. The packaging is gorgeous and the palette itself is weighty and very elegant looking. This would look amazing on a makeup vanity. As a pro, I'm debating if I want to add it to my kit due to the weight. Normally, I would just depot the shadows, but the case is too gorgeous to let go to waste.\n\nI love that it contains all different textures of shadows to create endless looks as this isn't a common find in most eyeshadow palettes. There's mattes, shimmers, and glitter/metallics. All of them are super pigmented. Mattes are super blendable and not chalky, shimmers are soft in texture, and the glitter/metallics can be either a glitter or a solid metallic by using liquid on your brush. The only thing I would change as a pro is making the palette refillable. I would change nothing as a consumer.",2
"I'm asian with super oily skin. good is that there are alot of shades that fit asian skin tones. this does not break me out and coverage was good but does not absorb oil that well, I could live with that and this review would have been 4 stars if it wasn't for the packaging. for the price packaging could have been wayyyy better. the pan fell out into my bathroom floor there was still at least half the product left and it completely cracked and couldn't be salvaged. I usually apply this wet so it was worthless to me at this point. I actually went to sephora that afternoon to purchase a different powder foundation brand.",1
"I'm a sucker for anything ""calming"" and initially I loved this product. I couldn't get over how soft it made my face! After a few weeks of use, though, I noticed that my skin was less balanced and much more irritated, with breakouts in places I usually have clear skin. Went back to my plain squalane and everything resolved, so something in this oil doesn't agree w my sensitive skin.",1
"I’m a very fair cool toned natural blonde and I get lots of compliments when I wear this.  It’s sheer and feels really nice on the lips, and is a great moisturizer.  I ordered two more b/c it’s only $3.00.",3
"I'm conflicted about this brush.  It's probably the best foundation brush I've owned (I've owed my fair share, never cheap brushes and some considerably more pricey than this one).  I find that it works well with every liquid foundation I've tried it with, giving a flawless, airbrushed look - no streaks and even coverage.  No shedding and the dense shape has held very well.  So why am I conflicted?  It's to do with cleaning - I regularly clean my brushes and for this one I give it a quick clean every second day.  It's so dense it picks up quite a bit of product and embeds it deep.  That means periodically it requires a ""deep"" clean, I like the bristles to look pristine.  It's pretty labor intensive and I use a mild shampoo or Castile soap.  The problem is that for some reason the deep clean leaves the brush smelling musty.  I've never had this happen before, all my other foundation brushes were perfectly okay air drying and I've always made sure to squeeze out extra moisture before leaving them to dry.  I think it might because of how dense the bristles are that it makes the brush stay wet /damp longer than normal, hence the wet dog smell.  I've unfortunately had to resort to using a dryer to accelerate the process, but it's a pain and there shouldn't be so much work to get a clean brush - no brush should smell funky after a proper, thorough clean.",4
I'm converted. I bought this because it was slightly cheaper than just a regular makeup eraser and it came with a super cute bag and headband. I have used this literally everyday since I've gotten it. The fabric is so soft and it really does work with any type of makeup. If I really feel like my mascara is giving me a hard time I'll rub some makeup remover lotion on the cloth and it's easily removed. Great product,0
"I'm disappointed this set is smaller than last year's set (but the same price) as well as the missing spatula.  Last year's set included 1 full size, 3 minis, and a spatula.  The little spatula is great to throw in your purse to apply on the go.  I bought 2 of the Elf Glitter Applicators for $3 each and use those at home.  They are basically the same thing as the small spatula with a full size handle.",2
"I'm disappointed with this product wouldn't recommend it to anyone, I only used it 3 times the bigger size came of the handle sucked!!! I'm still using the small size. I would store my money for something better!!! If I could I wouldn't rate this thing",1
"I mean...WOW! I expected to notice a little quicker hair growth with these but after about 1 month (of taking 1/2 dose daily) my stylist noticed new hair growth all over. Tons of hair that was about 1/2-3/4"" long.  I noticed my hair growing really quickly in length. I will continue taking 1/2 dose...mostly because I don't want my leg, underarm, and eyebrow hair growing even more quickly!  I also had a lot of breakage from extensions and the hair has really filled back in!",2
"I'm extremely disappointed and upset because all I got out of this expensive primer was a horrible looking clogged pores!!! covering my cheeks, although my skin care/makeup removal regimen remained the same! \nafter one week of discontinuation, my skin calmed down, yet I kept telling myself that it's not the primer, don't blame me, it's expensive and feels and smells really nice, so I gave it another try, and the next day I had more clogged pores! \nI'm shocked that Dior made such a horrible product! when I came here to write my review, I noticed that I was not the only person complaining.\nbeside my disappointment, and loosing $60, I had to invest in 3 skin care products that contains salicylic acid to treat my clown face :(",4
"I'm extremely disappointed. this palette is my favorite color and finish. however, this is the second palette I baught that had crumbled after a few uses. they both broke right away and I am very careful with my makeup. I wont buy this again and now have to search for another HG blush. I hate how overpriced brands put out crap product.",1
"I'm extremely disappointed with the new formula. I used the original mattifier for about 7 years and loved it. It really was such a game changer for me. It did a great job at keeping my oily skin under control, and my makeup looked great over it. This new formula is not mattifying at all. My face looks oily when I wear it, even more so than when I don't. I feel like this new product should be advertised as a moisturizer with SPF and they should have left the old mattifier alone.",2
I'm extremely impressed with this product. It's a light formula with amazing coverage. It's easy to blend with my sigma brush. Looks natural and doesn't cake up. I would have given 5 stars but I didn't like is the packaging itself. The packaging feels cheaper than most high-end concealers I've used. I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. #influenster,1
"I'm extremely pale and I usually use the in shower gradual tan a few times to get an even foundation before applying a regular self tanner, so thought I would give this a try. For context, sephora's bright future gel concealer in Bavarian cream (I think the lightest colour they make) matches my skin perfectly with no tan.  I used an entire bottle, and even started leaving the tan on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing and it did absolutely nothing. I thought maybe my shower temperature was too hot, so I started turning it down, and even that didn't work.",3
"I’m eyebrow obsessed which you’ll see from my before and after photos... I think this product is too hard of on the eyebrows and does not leave a natural look. However, the comb is nice and I like that it comes in various colors. I received this product as a free sample to review honestly.",0
im fairly new to the makeup game but I have tried around 5 or 6 different setting powders. this powder is the winner HANDS DOWN. this makes my makeup hold all day. even on my oily nose. I can't go without this.,1
"I'm furious that I spent the money to get such little use out of these products. I own Bronze, Nude, & Peach; as well as the duochromes in Mauve, Terracotta, & Lavender. At first they're stunning top coat. I would've rated them highly. I've only had them less than a year, some less than 6 months. I just went to use one. Every shade is rock hard. I've kept them stored right side up in acrylic organizer; with its lid on tight. About $114 down the drain.",3
"I'm giving this 2 stars because the blush was as advertised, just too small for me. The lip balm however didnt have any pigment. I was so excited. I can get a good lip balm for less. I'll be buying the full size Orgasm blush one day but I'm disappointed. I'm glad this wasn't a gift for someone",0
"I'm giving this 4 stars based on what the description says its ideal use is-post sun exposure, peels, facials, waxing, extractions. Basically anything that has reddened or aggravated the skin. I have combo sensitive skin that burns just by seeing a picture of the sun. Like other reviewers I've used this product when I've done too much to my skin such as sunburns, trying new products that ended up too strong for my skin, etc. It has the consistency of aloe, only a very mild smell and went on clear enough that I can run out quickly for coffee while wearing it and not look crazy. At first I didnt really expect it to do much more than aloe, but it did seem to calm my skin better with less sticky residue than other after sun products I've used. And left my skin slightly more moisturized than those gel like products. As a calming treatment I think its stellar, particularly for sensitive skin or those who accidentally overdid it with products/treatments/sun. As a hydrator I would only recommend it for those with oily skin and for hotter months. It hydrates similar to a very light gel moisturizer. For combo or dry skin theres so many other hydrating masks out there if that's the particular effect you're looking for.",2
"I'm going to begin this review by addressing the sleep benefits. If you're an insomniac like myself, I think it will help you greatly to determine the source of your sleep problems. If you are having difficulty resetting your sleep schedule, I think a melatonin supplement such as HUM's Beauty zZz will suit you best. On the other hand, if your struggle is overthinking/worrying at night, I think this is very much worth trying! The blend of valerian, hops, and passion flower is phenomenal for calming my racing mind, with all three ingredients helping to calm anxiety.\n\nI am very intrigued by the addition of skin benefits in this supplement as well. It's a thoughtful touch and makes me look forward to taking this supplement.",1
"I'm going to start with talking about the bottle itself because that's something I care about. I don't like cheap looking lipstick bottles, especially if I spend a good amount of money and this one is definitely high quality. It's magnetic which I love and it looks expensive and it looks high quality so it's a great add on to my current collection. I usually go for a neutral or pinkish kind of color so this one is different for me. I wanted darker colors for my collection to round it out. I thought this was more golden brown but it's actually a chocolate brown but that's my fault because it clearly says mocha. I was a little disappointed. When you're shopping online you're at the mercy of what it looks like in the photos, it's just a bit darker than I thought. I'm going to try more colors. I will say it goes on smooth and is long-lasting.",2
"I’m hooked for life. The trick to dispensing is to make sure you’ve opened the hole all the way with the back of the cap and warm it a bit on a cold morning. I have tucked it in my bra to heat it up if it’s cold while I make coffee.  It squeezes out perfectly then.  I have struggled with dry, chapped lips that would sometimes peel all my life.  Not any more. Since using this balm, my lips are always soft. I use the clear at night (keep it on my nightstand) so it doesn’t transfer to my pillow. Wake up with soft, smooth lips all the time. I used smashed or champagne for daytime. Very glossy.  I do reapply during the day, but it is more for appearance than for comfort.  \n\nI love this stuff!  All of my friends I have given it to for gifts (the little 3pack) love it and now they all use it.",3
"I'm impressed with this concealer. \nIt's so hard to find a concealer that actually conceals but doesn't cake underneath my eye's. \nwhen I received the concealer to test and review  though  Influenster I didn't think it would work as good as it does. The color match is perfect to cover up my dark under eye's that I have. \nThat's an issue I seem to always have is finding the right shade that isnt yellow or chalky looking on my skin. The coverage is perfect , doesnt cake just like it states , has staying power and isn't heavy.\nThe consistency is nice light weight and blends very easily.  I put three small dots of concealer under each eye and blend it out with a small makeup brush. I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try the new Benefit Cakeless Concealer through Influenster  because now I've found my new favorite under eye concealer!",3
I'm in love with First aid skin care products. I've only been using this for two weeks and I've noticed a small reduction in hyperpigmentation on my face. I've had these marks for over 3-4 years and never seen a change untill now! For $22 this will forever be my go to skin care product!,1
"I'm in love with this lip mask. I'll have chapped, cracked lips and within 5 minutes of putting this on my lips already feel more supple and hydrated; I can open my mouth all the way without my lips cracking/splitting! I use it as a lip gloss daily to take full advantage of the benefits. None of the lip products I have tried, and I've tried a lot, even come close in comparison to the Agave Lip Mask. Thank you, Bite Beauty!",1
"I'm in love with this night mask.... it's a heavy night cream consistancy (which i like, i can't deal with ""jelly pudding"" masks that feel like snot) that makes you look a bit oily/shiny after applying which worried me because I break out super easily. However I have never broken out from this mask and i wake up every morning looking radiant. Will continue to buy forever!",1
"I'm in my 30s, I've had years of eye pulling (putting on and removing make up) and rubbing my eyes (seasonal allergies) I've noticed the elasticity around my eyes have diminished. I've tried a lot of eye creams and serums and they never worked. I've finally found my holy grail! So hydrating and works wonderful as a base for concealer. 100% reccomend this product!!",1
"I’m in my 40’s and although I don’t have actual wrinkles yet, I’m always on the lookout for facial products that smooth, brighten, or tighten my skin a bit but are easy to use.  This powder fits the bill, with a fresh, clean feeling and is one of the few things I’ve used that has an immediately noticeable plumping effect.  The scent is nice and there’s a slight tingle on my skin but no burning.  Unfortunately the mini size does NOT have anything built in to regulate the amount dispensed, and it requires some focus to tap out just the right amount.",2
"I’m in my early 50s with sensitive skin and was soooo AMAZED to see how these made my small under eye lines fade! I honestly didn’t expect to see much change since these little lines have been with me for many years, but I totally noticed a difference!!! Those micro needles even feel good when you apply the patches. LOVE this product and will definitely keep using it!!",3
"I'm in my late 30's and am beginning to get tiny wrinkles directly below my lower line, as well as crow's feet. I have fair skin and have always struggled with dark circles. My skin in typically pretty oily, but my under eyes often feel desert-dry. I've tried a number of eye creams, in $$ to $$$$ price range. Bye Bye Under Eye both promises AND delivers! It hydrates my dry spots without going greasy, has lightened my circles, and I've seen a visible reduction in those tiny under eye wrinkles, along with a reduction in puffiness when I'm dehydrated or haven't been getting the best sleep. This product has a higher sticker price, but a little goes a long way. I've definitely found an awesome addition to my daily skin care routine.",4
"I’m in my mid 20’s and was looking for a new night cream and this one is fantastic. I had been using Sunday Riley CEO cream, but I like this one much better. It goes on quite light but feels very moisturizing. Top marks go to how brightening it is. I’ve been asked by a few people if i’ve had a chemical peel. I’m seeing a bit more of a rapid fading in my acne scars, but nothing show stopping. Overall would recommend to anyone, my fav night cream i’ve tried so far!",0
I'm in my mid 30's and this primer does GREAT job at minimizing the fine lines in my forehead and T-zone pores.    I use this underneath silicone based foundation and it works beautifully!  No pilling up.,0
"I'm in my mid-thirties,  so fine lines around my eyes were starting to creep in.  I've used this cream for over a year with stellar results.   Fine lines have been reduced to barely noticeable,  and nothing new has creeped up.  Holy Grail for me, for sure!",4
I'm in the middle of a rosacea flare and decided to give this a shot. It's fragrance free and felt pretty soothing when I applied it. I wasn't expecting much but when I woke up in the morning the redness was significantly better (confirmed by the hubby) and my face felt pretty smooth and soft. Didn't do anything for the little red spots but I didn't expect it to and was just glad that it calmed things down a bit. I plan on using this every night until this stupid flare up goes away. Definitely give it a try!,1
I'm normally a big fan of Huda Beauty products and I was looking forward to trying this but I'm disappointed. I don't like the brush. The amount of liquid in the container is too little for the price you're paying. but the worst thing about this item is that it doesn't come off. I tried 4 different types of make up removers from oil to water based to alcohol even and not all of it would come off. and this is trying it on my hand. imagine I tried it on my eyes and rubbed this much my eye would come off.  like after rubbing so hard the back of my hand is red and hurts and i still have some residue of the eyeliner. like what on earth are you supposed to use to take it off. ???,4
"I'm normally a fan of the sephora liquid eyeliners. This one is dark and goes on easy, but I notice it bleeds very easily. These felt tip eyeliners in general tend to get little pieces of the fuzz loose every now and then, as well. With the price point its pretty good but I would not buy again due to the bleeding issue.",1
"I'm not a big fan of powder foundations because  I could never find one that would have the coverage  I want but this one is by far the best I have tried. Love the new formula! It's full coverage and makes your skin look smooth. I have big pores and it's barely noticeable with this. I sometimes use it by itself or to set with my liquid foundation. My only complaint would be color range.... I hope she expands the colors in the near future, they're either too yellow or red. I do have to mix it with other shades to get my match. I also had to do this with the previous Lock-It powders.",1
"I'm not a fan of traditional lipsticks, but these are pretty good. They're so pigmented and long lasting. I love that they smell like creme brulee and the packaging is so pretty. They're also very matte.",2
"I'm not a lipstick kind of chick, i stick with lip balms and glosses. This had a decent amount of staying power however it totally dried my lips out after a couple of hours. The color Glace is universal, i bought a few others and this was the only color that was a solid rose/mauve that seemed a good dark-neutral. I bought it on sale, so I'll keep it but definitely returning the darker ones i bought,  dark colors on dry lips won't look good!",4
"I'm not an eyeshadow expert but needed something versatile for special days, that could be day or night and allow me to do both warm and cool, neutral and exciting looks, and this fits the bill. easy formula, great color payoff, easy to remove. The shimmers build up really well and I really appreciate the extra eyeliner included! perfect way to round off a smokey eye.",4
"I'm not a veryug fan of waterproof mascara but got this as a gift so I gave it a try and was surprised. It made my lashes look great, it gave them volume. If you get this make sure you get a good waterproof makeup remover.",0
"I'm not big on setting sprays, but tried this out after it was recommended by a friend. the product definitely works, but the spray is super aggressive. Not sure if I'll use it again for that reason, but definitely works better than other sprays.",0
"I'm not impressed that hemp seed was used as a marketing tactic. The green dye is way too much. It's not possible for cannabis to be THAT green. The nonfragrant smell is off and the texture is kind of grainy if not warmed up on the hands before application. Overall, the product isn't entirely terrible. It does moisturize but would not recommend for the price and the overall way this product was marketed and the claims it had with hemp seed. I received this product for free to review.",0
"I'm not makeup pro, but I do know blending my concealer with my finger was difficult. Bought this because the reviews were good and the brush was cheap, and boy oh boy I'm glad I did! It really does blend smoothly. I don't use the magnetic bottom since I store my brushes in a plastic cup, but it is a neat idea if that's what you want to do.",1
"I'm not much for ""lipstick"" so I have to say this product is a game changer.  It feels so light but SOOO moisturizing and it lasts and lasts!  I have 3 of the shades to go with my skin tone (summer tan to winter pale), not sure if I'll ever go back to ordinary lip gloss.",3
"I'm not new to this formula and I love the pops and use and love them as toppers with finger. This specific quad, except for the last darkest shade is very dry and has very little output. Very little transfers onto the finger and barely anything transfers onto the lid.",1
"I'm not one to care about a product smells as long as it works. \nbut this here, the odor is unbearable. \nI cant even think to put the product on without preparing myself and my husband with the smell. \n\nso if odor is one thing you care about I would def not recommend",4
"I'm not really sure how I feel about this one. It emphasizes any dry areas I have, separates on my forehead, and transfers terribly. I don't notice how bad my forehead looks until I get up close in a mirror...I guess that's a plus. I hated the way it applied with a beauty blender, so I use a brush. I want to love this but I just can't.",2
"I'm not sure how I feel about this... I like the packaging, & the scent of product. It did seem to keep my makeup on longer.. but I found this to be a watery primer; I was expecting it to be a thick moisturizing gel primer like aloe vera... so with that said I found this primer hard to apply... I'll continue to use it but most likely won't repurchase it because of the consistency.",1
"I'm not sure this product is strong enough for me. I have seen little to no difference in my skin since I started using it about 6 months ago. I started slow at first but quickly got to the point where I've been using it every night even though it's not recommended so frequently. My skin is used to regular use of chemical exfoliation so maybe that's why this isn't doing much. It has a few irritants in the ingredients so I wouldn't recommend it for sensitive skin, but ideal for beginners in retinol. Not for chemical veterans like me.",4
"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I have clear skin wit a couple spots of hyperpigmentation & a little under eye discoloration. This ""concealer "" is hard to spread, doesn't cover anything,  and was blotchy in its ""coverage.""",3
"I'm not sure what the difference is, but the black works so much better. I mean she's cute or whatever, but it's soupy and doesn't stick as well as the black. Just get the black and fill in with liner. It'll be less trouble",0
"I'm not sure what this product does. I recieced the mini in a purchase of other milk products, and while it is cooling, I dont notice much of a difference under my eyes in terms of puffiness (if that's even what its meant for?) I wouldn't get this product again.",4
"I'm not sure whether this product did anything for me or not. I was using Skinsceutical's Phloretin serum before I started with this one, so I couldn't really tell if my skin improved. It definitely didn't make it worse, and I really wanted to love this serum but again, I didn't see any difference...",4
I'm not sure why the bad reviews..maybe because people have come to accept that a highlighter must be highly.pigmented and blinding. I am so glad I didn't care about the reviews and picked this up anyway. SO HAPPY I DID! This is a sheer beautiful gold highlight that is used as a TOPPER and looks stunning over your highlighter or just by itself and can be built for intensity. Definitely work a try at least!,4
"I'm obsessed with brow gels, its my main beauty staple. if my brows are good, I'm good. my favorite so far has been Milk's Kush tinted brow gel. this one is very similar (good brush, good pigment, nice finished look), but is worse, in my opinion, for two reasons. one, the texture as kaja dries on your brows isn't great. not the crunchiest, but not as comfortable as the Kush. two, it's scented for some reason??? I don't know why perfumed eyebrows are a goal here. it smells like tresemme hairspray. not pleasant and not great for those sensitive to fragrance. overall, decent brow gel but not HG material.",0
"I'm obsessed with this product. I use it after exfoliating with my ole sauna scrub, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft, even into the next day. I love the smell and texture of this product too. I would highly recommend this to anyone, I've never found a better facial and I've tried just about everything",1
"I'm obsessed with this roller. I bought it as a bday gift to myself and I love it. The rose quartz and the rose gold colored hardware just makes me happy. I keep it in the fridge, use a face mask, then roll the leftover serum into my skin. It's one of the best things I've bought myself.",1
I'm older and have always not liked lip products.  Lipstick was too pigmented and matte/drying. Lip gloss is for women much younger and too sticky.\n\nThis colour is beautiful and I found it reasonably long lasting.  It was the perfect amount of colour and shine for a novice luke me. I will definitely buy again,4
"I’m on day three with this, despite the burning and stinging, because it smells sooooo good, it’s packed with nutrients, it’s supposedly for sensitive skin, and it works for so many other people. I gave it a shot, but my eye area skin is too sensitive for its own good. It’s infuriating, actually, because the only thing that doesn’t inflame or upset my eye area is Aquaphor, which I’m pretty sure isn’t doing anything for the wrinkles and aging that’s going on. It helps with the burning, which is why I use it. I’ve tried many other things labeled for sensitive skin, but Kiehl’s Avocado was the only thing that didn’t bother me. Unfortunately I don’t like that, so I guess I’ll keep looking.",1
"I'm only 41, so Eye Cream has never been on my radar, but I received this as a sample to review, and I have to say, I'm impressed! I'd seen the item on a TV shopping channel (the Q), but always just kind of ignored the presentation... I'm not old... OLD people need eye cream, right?\n\nNOPE! Everyone can use eye cream. The skin under my eyes has never looked so soft and smooth. I feel like my makeup is sitting better. My eyes don't itch from the dry skin. I've never had the curse of dark circles, but either I am seeing a bit of brightening ANYWAY, or I'm just imagining I am... either way, I like what I see!\n\nBecause you use so little of it, this jar will last a LONG time, too, which makes it a great value for the payoff you get. I would totally recommend this to anyone my age, older than me, or even younger than me so they can get a headstart on taking care of that delicate skin!",2
"I'm on the fence. I love the natural finish and light weight feel, but throughout the day I felt oily and if I touched my face the foundation would smudge and stay on my fingers. I've used this with Tart pore erasing primer, Smashbox primer, setting powder, and Urban Decay All Nighter. The foundation still wouldn't stay put and looked oily and cakey at the end of the day. I felt beautiful walking out the door, but by lunch I wanted to take it all off.",0
"I'm on the fence- I love the sleekness of this design but it is COMPLETELY UNWIELDY. Very slippery, cannot grasp one-handed; brush idea great but also awkward to use without gouging into powder. \n\nThe product itself is beautiful for about an hour or less; otherwise imperceptible. If I had to the time to re touch-up every 5 minutes, I'd go through this compact within a week. \n \nI'd love to love this compact, but I'm not totally sold on it for the above reasons. Too expensive to not really be functional.",2
"I'm picky about liquid brow products but this one surprised me.  Instead of using the wand directly to my brows, I run it across a brow brush and then apply. That way I don't have to deal with excess and I get the right amount of coverage. I took a chance on the shade because at the time there were only 2 available but it worked out perfectly!",2
"Impressed right away!! from the packaging and the pump style of the mask. I have temperamental skin. I have combination skin a bit closer to the oily side. This product was a huge surprise in how well I feel it has been working for my skin. I really like that the product starts out pink and turns white when ready to sit. After wiping away left my skin feeling soft not oily or dry just soft. The only complaint I have is I'm personally not crazy about the smell but I'm known to be funny about smells, so. The bottle recommends 2x a week to use which has been perfect because I like to do my big skincare routines on Sundays before the week starts over and Wednesdays to push through the second half of the week.",1
"Impressed with the product itself, it's pretty perfect. But giving 3 stars for the packaging. I didn't realize it's actually supposed to be a pump since it was stuck inside the lid... was using it like a spatula. How does a reputable, well established makeup company like Nars create a product with such awful packaging? Frustrating. \n\nThe blush itself though is really nice on the skin. Was worried when i saw ""shimmer"" in the description of the color but bought it anyway and i'm really pleased with how it looks on my brown skin.",1
"Impressed with this formula.  Curled my lashes as I always do. Mascara went on with no clumps, stayed all day without irritating my eyes, and lengthened my lashes!  I am constantly trying new mascaras and thought, heh, with this one.  But I will repurchase.  It works!",4
"I'm pretty obsessed with this. It brightens without being obnoxious and has really good coverage especially considering how lightweight it is. It feels sooo good under my eyes and instantly makes me look awake. I can wear it without any other makeup if I want to but I usually just wear it with a tinted moisturizer. I've been using it basically every day but I'm still not sure it's been long enough to notice any long term skin care benefits, but like I said it feels amazing under the eyes. And it doesn't crease or bunch up in my lines at ALL it's kinda crazy. I love this stuff so much. It's expensive but it works plus the packaging is so freaking beautiful so I think it's totally worth it. Obsessed.",1
"I'm really disappointed in this palette.\xa0 Had my eyes on it for the longest time and finally picked it up during the holiday sale.\xa0 The shimmers, Antheia and Dark Sepia barely shows up on my lids, taking multiple layers to actually look decent.\xa0 The two mattes are good, though Bia really needs building up as well.\xa0 The glitter, D'or is terrible.\xa0 Will not stay on my lids no matter what type of primer I used, I even tried misting makeup spray on top to make it stay in place, but nothing worked.\xa0 At the end of the day, D'or would be all over my face and the other shadows would be pretty much gone except the lines left in my crease.\xa0 It went back after two weeks of trying to make it work.  Two stars for beautiful packaging.",2
"I’m really glad I purchased thIs eye brush set. Very good quality, soft, but not too soft, bristles that pick up and apply product very well, and nice sturdy handles. You’ll definitely find use for every brush in this set. The price is very good too. I feel like it was money well spent.",2
"I'm really happy with The Ordinary Caffeine Solution. It helps to brighten my eye area AND I tried it on the tip of my nose because it had started taking on redness and this solution has reduced the redness of my nose. I don't like to wear a lot of makeup and concealer, especially on my nose... It always looks obvious. So I am very happy this helps reduce the redness.",3
"I'm really loving The Ordinary products! Tried this toner to see how it compared to my much-loved and frequently purchased Mario Badescu glycolic toner...and love it even more! My skin does well with glycolic acid. I've incorporated it into my skincare for the last couple years (basically since I got serious about taking care of my skin and slowing the aging process) and find it's what does the most for my nearly-50-year-old skin issues with the least irritation. My cleansers (ExfoliKate and Microdelivery) have glycolic acid, my every-other-night serum (Farmacy Honeymoon Glow) is brimming with it, and my favorite masks (DE Babyfacial and The Ordinary AHA/BHA ""blood"" mask) are chockful of it. My skin tolerates glycolic remarkably well and this toner preps it for all the products I use on top of it. It's not super drying as many glycolic toners can be. It makes my skin feel clean and smooth.  I feel it helps control breakouts too. Plus you get a huge bottle for less than $8! This toner does everything my ride-or-die Mario Badescu toner has done for me for years but with slightly less dryness and at a more palatable price. Highly highly recommend this (and the other Ordinary products I've tried).",3
"I’m revising a previous review. I gave this set another try and it’s well worth the $$ to try some new products! The makeup primer works really well! No creasing, makeup stayed in place:) The mascara gave me really full and long lashes. Significantly more than other mascaras I’ve tried. Pretty amazing stuff, no clumping, no flaking. The solid serums are nice. Lightweight and sticks are convenient. The lip/cheek color is pretty. Soft, universal. The only stick I thought could use some improvement was the bronzer. It was a bit dry and broke off as I was trying to open it. I think I prefer the ease of powder bronzer anyway. The highlighter stick is very wearable, not too much shimmer or shine. I did use both the bronzer and highlighter on my eyes, and liked the results so it’s definitely a very usable and versatile kit. Get it!!!",1
"I'm shocked I love this! I don't use it all over my face, just my cheek bones and forehead. The product looks freaking cool. Like a holographic opal liquid. It gives me a beautiful glow without being oily at all! Definitely worth a try! I received this product as a free sample.",0
I'm shocked that these made it through the entire production process and into stores. 3 of these look like concealer and the 4th is a wierd not-really-nude chrome pink kind of color. didn't even try the gloss.. I was packing it up to return it before I had the chance. only giving it 2 stars because the formula seemed alright.,1
"I'm skincare obsessed and try pretty much every product out there, I can honestly say that within weeks of trying this I could see a difference in my skin. Especially with the discoloration of skin, it has made my skin dewy and flawless!",1
"I'm slightly confused why this has such a good rating. Maybe I just don't look my lashes like most people, but I find this very goopy and fullllll coverage. I have had a lot of mishaps with this formula because it layers on so thick. I have the wipe off the excess product from the wand before i use it, and even then it's a little much.",0
"I'm so confused? The description says reddened plum, and the pic of the lipstick looks red or berry in color. What I received was a lipstick that looked pink, and swatched a deep pink not unlike their popular Indian Rose lipstick? Is this some sort of error in manufacturing, or is this the actual color? I can't even return this because it's a deluxe sample. I already have Indian Rose, and unlike popular opinion, I did not like it, and it was not all flattering on me. I really wanted to try a red color from Tom Ford, but yet again, another pink! Same thing happened to me with the color Tomboy, just another pink color!!!",2
"I'm so glad I found the Ordinary, after spending thousands on other high end products.  I started with the regular buffet, which I loved, and then decided to try this one with the copper and wow, what an amazing difference! I never see radical changes in my skin but have after starting these products.  Although this is slightly sticky upon application, I find that it only lasts a few minutes.  I use it both morning and night (and also use their moisturizer, hyaluronic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid and alpha lipoic acid- not all on the same day!!) and have had no issues with my make up.  My skin looks amazing and glows.  My skin was never bad, as I've never had many issues with blemishes or irritation, but at 43 it was looking dull and lifeless.  Not anymore! I'm happy not using any other coverage on most days now although I still love my mineral powder.  I've experienced no pilling, with my powder or with my many, many foundations (I like switching things up and use hourglass, CD, tarte, bareminerals, Marc Jacobs, Mac, erborian CC cream, IT- no issues at all).",2
"I’m so glad I found this glittery lipstick! I’m over 50, and yes, wear glitter lipstick, and proud of it. We didn’t have these things when I was younger. Elektra was the first shade I bought, and although I eventually bought them all, I love this color on me the best! It’s a deep rose-purple that looks great with my very fair skin (and dark burgundy hair). It’s not garish or cartoonish at all—but you see the glitter when the light catches it or in sunshine. The only comparison I have is to the Pat McGrath Blitztrance lipstick, and they are way too subtle. This gives just enough reflective sparkle without being over the top. It’s smooth and lasts on my lips. Highly recommend to add a little shine to your day!",3
Im so glad im not the only one having problems with this moisturizer! i wanted to love it so bad but it never fully sinks into the skin leaving me feeling sticky through the day.. yuck also i have been breaking out and i know its the moisturizer that caused it... def will be a return,0
"I'm so glad that I was given a sample of this foundation before I purchased it, because it does not wear well at all. This foundation emphasizes my pores, my acne scars and any dry patches I might have. Also this foundation makes my skin look greasy as well. I am very diligent about using quality skincare products, exfoliating and moisturizing so this is definitely not a foundation that I would care to waste my money on to be completely honest. If you purchased this, and it's not working out for you don't hesitate to take it back for a refund!",3
I'm so happy I purchased this set. It has alot of formulas and brands I have never tried and have kept In my shopping list for months. It gave me an opportunity to see what formulations I love and shades that work for me while finding new favorites. The Charlotte Tilbury lipstick you cannot go wrong with it's a flattering brown mauve shade. The colours are very flattering in this kit and the balms are equally as good. Great buy!,0
"I'm so happy to have received a free sample of this! I normally steer clear of glitter at this stage of my life, but this product provides a very wearable sheen that can be worn alone or layered subtly over other shadows. I'm also impressed with how flattering the shade turned out to be for my skintone! My only wish is that it had more staying power on my oily complexion.",4
"I'm so impressed! I've always had to use 2 separate primers, one on pore area and one for the rest of my face, this is the ONLY primer I have ever used that really does both blur pores and create a nice base. I've also used it only on pores and used another primer on the perimeter of my face for a glowy effect and it worked beautifully together. I can't believe I waited this long to try it! I have tried practically every pore minimizing primer at sephora and this  is by far much better!!",3
"I'm so impressed with this primer! So easy to apply, simply glide your finger over the top of the primer (gently) then pat it onto your pore areas while smoothing in a downward motion, your pores literally disappear with such a tiny amount, this will last forever, so glad I bought the mini ! I use powder foundation over it and urban decay all nighter spray. Looks so smooth!",3
"I'm so, so disappointed by this palette. I thought I finally had the shades for a wicked burgandy look and was very hyped since it's a NATASHA DENONA palette. But it just didn't live up to the hype. It might be because I have darker skin, but the two matte colors Sakura and Blossom (perfect for a burgandy look), look exactly the same on my eyes. The Sakura is so dull, adding the Blossom didn't give it any dimension at all. I'd probably need studio quality white light for the colors to be differentiated on my skin. \n\nThe biggest reason for the one star however is because immediately after opening my palette, two of the pans fell out. These pans go for $4.80 a pop (if you bought it on sale like I did) or they're nearly $10 at full price. How can they just fall out like that? I'm so upset. \n\nThe only redeeming thing about this palette is the shimmery orange color, Botanic. It looks beautiful over the Sakura.",0
"I'm soup bummed this product was a bust. I've heard so much about The Ordinary and their prices are amazing. I have some fine lines, my skin is not sensitive at all, and I am not prone to breakouts (I didn't even get acne as a teen!) I used for 2 weeks, 2x daily. There is absolutely no difference in fine lines but I got almost 10 blemishes, all at the same time! I kept the rest of my routine identical, so it's definitely this serum. I wish I knew what ingredient is comedogenic so that I could try a different product without that ingredient.",1
I'm still having mixed thoughts about the new formula for the day lip balm because they did change it from what their original one was. For the lip mask I really love it. it feels like the original formula for the lip balm it's nice and thick (kinda hard to apply) but once it warms up to your lips it's great! and I also really like the nighttime lip balm in the jar! if you really want to choose one item out of all 3 though I recommend the lip mask if you want the bigger size because all of these items that come in this package are pretty small so if I had to choose one I would get the lip mask! I still think this is a cute idea for like a Christmas gift or birthday gift!,4
I'm still trying this out but so far I do really like it. it's very gentle and doesnt leave you feeling anything like a typical tingly or burning feeling from an aha serum. I feel like its definitely helping my skin hold hydration better but I haven't noticed a significant change in my pores or coloring yet.,0
"I'm still trying to figure out how to incorporate this into my skincare routine.  So far, I've attempted to use this many ways -- on top of moisturizer; mixed with moisturizer; on top of serum; mixed with hyaluronic acid; on its own.  Regardless of what I do, I get a rogue blemish somewhere on my face the day I use this.  It's not an ""I'm going to stick around with you"" blemish - it usually resolves itself within a few days -- but as someone who has rarely ever broken out ever (and I'm marching toward Medicare. . .), it's not a happy thing.  Not sure whether my tendency toward rosacea in recent years has informed my skin's reactions to this -- I will keep trying.  My baby fly away hairs around my hairline like it, though. . .  Buying the mini was a good idea.  It's a lovely product but perhaps not for me.",3
"I'm super picky when it comes to skincare and this is the first eye cream that I actually like. I bought the full size after trying a sample. Super creamy and it smells really nice. I mostly use it at night, but I also use it sometimes under my makeup.",0
"I'm surprised by how much I love this foundation. I do find it makes a big difference which primer I use under it - the Skin Love primer definitely is the best choice for a smooth application but I have been able to use both kabuki brushes and sponges for application with success. The color adjusts to my skin and it blends beautifully. As well, it is definitely buildable - I can let my natural skin show through some or I can cover blemishes with ease. It lasts a long time too so I don't worry that it has faded within a few hours. I like it more than my prior Marc Jacobs foundation as I find it color matches/adjusts to my skin more than that did.",2
"I'm terrible at sleeping...despite my absolute love for the activity. I have tried just about all natural and pharmacological treatment options.  Most of these leave me feeling like a zombie or wide awake for the night. \n\nI would love to proclaim that I will never take a sleeping pill after using this supplement, but that's generally just not how things work. Unfortunately this isn't my cure-all, but it has allowed me to cut out the unreasonable amount of melatonin I was taking every night to get to sleep. \n\nThe added benefit of increased cell turnover and possibility that my skin will benefit from inside out? I'll take it! Honestly, if it helps me sleep AND provides other benefits (or even the chance at it - because of good ingredients) why the heck would I NOT continue using it?\n\nI was gifted this product to test and review...but my bad sleep and opinions on it are my own. :)",1
I'm the kind of person I don't like fill in my eyebrows. I have pretty thick brows already. This product helps me to make less visible if I have a gap. Really easy to use. Comes in different natural colors. Make sure to get your color right.,4
"I'm totally obsessed with both the Swanky and Vivacious styles of these lashes. The price kinda sucks because I'm used to buying drugstore lashes, but the quality is well worth the few extra dollars. They last a really long time. I have a pair that I've been wearing consistently since October and they're still holding on.",4
I must have been hiding under a rock because I am just now finding this wonderful product.  I don't usually type up recommendation but today it was necessary.  I have been experiencing mild acne and hyper pigmentation and most products were not doing the job.  A wonderful associate at Ulta recommended this product to me and I experienced immediate results.  The hyper pigmentation is peeling off and the new skin is shining through.  It's an amazing product.,2
"I must have gotten a deluxe sample of this at some point and put it aside with all my other lippies without trying or giving much thought about it. I was going through my makeup ""mini store"" yesterday, throwing out almost empty and old products and when I came across this, I decided to try it on. THIS is my RED! The color is just the perfect red for me! The quality and pigmentation are out of this world. The only thing that could have made it better would be if it was more of a traditional, satin type of lipstick other than matte simply because matte formulations are merciless when it comes to having the lines that come when lips loose some of their volume as we age. It's far from a deal breaker though, and it is by no means an uncomfortable or drying matte formulation. I have found my HG red lipstick!",4
"I must have missed this as a ""sculpting"" brush. I was thinking more of a full ""bronzer"" brush. This brush was a lot smaller than I thought it was, I should've looked at it in the store first. I like it for contouring my cheeks with bronzer, but that's it. I still need to use a fluffier brush to bronze my face. I'll keep it because it is nice, but I won't repurchase it whenever it dies.",2
"I'm very excited by this foundation because the finish is so lovely and natural looking.  I received a sample of this from Sephora and tried it.  The color darkened as it dried on application so it helps to try a sample first.  I'm extremely picky about foundations and this is a winner.  Goes on smoothly, looks natural but somehow ""finished"" at the same time, I guess because it covers nicely.  Really, really pretty finish.  Excellent color selection.  Definitely check this one out!",2
"I'm very guilty of not drinking enough water so I was curious if the Collagen Pop beauty tonic would\xa0really help me drink more water as well as improve my skin. (This sample was sent over by Hum.) It uses marine collagen and vitamin C to help improve skin elasticity and collagen levels. Since it's in a tablet form, I dissolved 1 tablet in 8 oz of water and I usually did this first thing in the morning so I wouldn't forget to take it. (Hum says it can be taken any time of the day.) How does it taste? It tastes like strawberry lemonade with a bit of fizz! This was very easy to drink on a daily basis and I love the tablets in the little tube container; it makes it so easy to travel with! I would love a version without the fizz since I can drink a lot more without the bubbles (personal and tummy preference). If I can drink collagen and make my skin look fabulous, you bet I’ll be doing it!",1
"I'm very happy with these as toner pads. They even helped reduce the rough skin I get when it gets really hot out. After using them on my face, they're still moist enough to use on the backs of my hands, wrists, elbows and the dry skin between my toes. The cost is the only reason I hesitate to buy them again.",3
I'm very impressed with concealer! I hardly had to use any at all to get the coverage I wanted and it blended out like a dream with my beauty blender. The applicator is nice and glides the product right on.,1
"I'm very new to skincare, but knew I wanted to have a cleaner product spread. This cute box gave me an entire basic starter routine with options!\nI've been using these products for 3-4 weeks now and they're generous sizes, especially with the inclusion of 2 full size products. Some favorites from the set are the Radiance Pads (cut them in half to make them last twice as long!), Eye Cream, Cleanser, and the two different moisturizers! The Coconut Water is lighter and sinks in immediately while the Repair Cream is a bit heavier, but it being the winter months my combo skin is happy for a bit extra moisture!\n\nThe other things I like about these is that they're good on multiple skin types (my friend also bought this and has extremely sensitive skin prone to redness and I have combo skin with dryness issues) and that you can easily introduce additional steps into your skincare with these.\n\nAll in all, especially since they're on sale I highly recommend this set! I've been using the treasure chest to hold all of my loose smaller products & might even buy a second set to keep my skincare going in 2020.",0
"I’m very skeptical of reviews using terms like ‘miracle’ or ‘amazing results’ because, frankly, even if I’ve liked the product I’ve never seen amazing results in the mirror...til now. BUT, I splurged and bought Skinceuticals F E serum when it was on sale. I really did see good results after a week or two. THEN I got a sample of this essence and have been using them together. OMG. Seriously awesome. I’m 67 with good genes and am told I look 50. But still my skin is losing elasticity.  Not sure if it’s just the AP essence or a combination of the two, but will need to start working overtime cuz now I’m hooked.",4
I'm wearing #175 lock it powder foundation over Fenty liquid #385. I am tanned right now. the color is lighter in the compact but warms on the skin without turning ashy or grey. I wear the #170 on the winter when I am not tanned. I think I can also use the #180 right now as well when I am tanned,4
I'm with Warrior 33. Regardless of whether or not this works it is the most offensive thing I've ever smelled. It literally smells rancid. I am stunned there aren't more people complaining here. I've washed my face 3 times with regular cleanser and I can still smell it on my hands and face. Negative stars. And yes I've checked the expiration date.,3
"I’m writing second review on this after reusing the products. I purchased four ID bottles/cartridges, 3 jelly/1 hydrating lotion when it was first released nearly a year ago. My favorite is the blue and white cartridge, but the orange one is good too! 4.5 stars generous. I’ve been a previous user of the moisturizing lotion for winter and my post peels. It’s an ok lotion really. The concept of doing an custom additive is amazing! I did stop noticing the results I was getting fours months in and started changing up my hydration regimen. But I purchased a galvanic micro-current spa machine and I kid you not, the hydrating jelly and serum combo being pushed deep into the pores!! a real winner!! I can’t believe how much better the product works! I will buy more of the jelly and blue/white serums, but I wasn’t really happy with the purple cartridge and the moisturizing lotion sadly. I may try the moisturizing lotion with the soothing green serum in the future.",0
"I’m writing this review after using this toner for about 2 weeks. First- love love the results. I notice immediate difference in my skin next day. The texture is smoother and, yes, there is that glow! \n\nHOWEVER, this product STINGS!! Every time I’ve used it, it would sting my skin for about a minute. It doesn’t irritate my skin beyond the stinging, so I’ve been continuing use bc of its efficacy. \n\nIf you don’t have sensitive skin, I would recommend ditching those watery first-step treatment essences for this product. \n\nFor me, I’m continuing my hunt for an AHA product that is equally effective but doesn’t sting my skin!",1
"In all honesty, I really don't get the hype about this product. It's a perfectly fine, heavy duty moisturizing cream, with some questionable ingredients, but there are several other much less expensive (though by no means cheap) creams that I prefer. I gave it 4 stars because it is very rich and deeply hydrating, but I will never purchase it again. I much prefer Algenist Genius Cream and Sleeping Collagen, which are both significantly less expensive. In the end, because of the cost, I can't recommend this when there are more effective products available for half the price.",4
"Indie Lee is cruelty free, which is the #1 thing I consider when buying a new product. I've used this for several days instead of my usual witch hazel. I have not noticed any change to my skin thus far. However this does leave you feeling sticky, which I do not like. Compared to witch hazel, which leaves you feeling clean. I also don't like the heavy bottle. I don't like packaging that will break if it drops and break your foot if you drop on it. I probably will not purchase again.",1
"I needed a moisturizer for my combo skin that would hydrate and also work well under my powder foundation, Bare Minerals. this gel moisturizer was recommended by a Sephora employee. I love it! My skin feels hydrated, looks great, and my makeup applies perfectly over it.",3
"I NEED this product; it is absolutely essential. I can't finish my look without it because the blur is so drastic. My skin texture instantly appears much smoother.\n\nEvery single other powder I have ever tried, both American and Asian, has broken me out, but I've used this for years without issue.",4
I never expected the results I've gotten from this product. I use this every other day or every third day since I have gotten it. My furrowed brow indent is gone after three uses. The last time this awful line was gone between my brows was when I had gotten Botox over a year ago. I don't look angry anymore. I mean--I'm still an angry person but I don't look as angry I internalize on a daily.,1
"I never go through lipglosses before they expire, but I wanted to try the fenty one. This was a great option, and I got to test the formula for their highlighter as well. I actually saw this on a girl in the bathroom and it was so intense, and when I got it home I was not disappointed. It is a deeper shade of gold so if you would consider your shade of skin to be light, it may not be flattering on you.\n\nThe lip gloss has reflective glimmers in it, but it is not too noticeable on the lip. I prefer wearing this without a lipstick underneath, for a wet pouty look.\n\nThe highlighter is smooth, not chunky and not glittery. It's metallic and intense. I apply it with a small fluffy brush over a wet base.",0
"I never had a ""regular"" foundation, other than powder minerals, or very sheer tints. I have finally learned what MUAs mean when they say foundation ""disappears"" into skin. I always thought that meant it absorbed or something...Or that you could blend in demarcation lines enough so that they weren't noticeable.  It means that the liquid matches your skin so exactly, you can't see it on your face! Over the years I've been ""matched"" to MAC NC35, MAC NC30, MAC C4, NARS Barcelona, NARS Stromboli, Face Atelier Tan, etc. I assumed those all ""matched"" my skin, because I could wear those shades without my skin having a glaringly obvious different color from the rest of me. \n\nI received a sample of this foundation in the shade 3.25, which is ""light tan with neutral undertones"". When tested it, I experienced the ""disappearing"" into my skin. I decided this foundation is something new and different, for real. When it was on my entire face, it looked incredible, but was it perfect? Before I knew better, I would have called this a miraculous match, but I decided I would see how other shades in this range looked. Though not a huge difference can been seen when looking at the bottles, 3.30 looks even more like my natural skin. The subtle changes in undertone make a huge difference on skin. This foundation is truly, completely invisible on my skin, and it makes my skin look INCREDIBLE. It covers melasma, pores, uneven tone, redness...and it stays put. It does not transfer, even onto my phone! I wear it over sunscreen and Cover FX Water Cloud Primer, set with Beautyblender Re-Dew Spray (another outstanding product). \n\nI didn't go out of my way to try this foundation because I got sucked in to the negativity surrounding the shade range that was initially launched. I can't stress enough how glad I am that I got a sample of this! Obviously, I totally understand the complaints about the exclusively ""olive/medium"" shade range. BUT - The range is miraculous for my seemingly impossible-to-ma",3
"I never knew my brows could look this good this easily until I opened up this kit.  From first application of all three products, my brow game went from a 3 to a 9, minimum!  The color dimension I get and the lasting hold are impressive.  I will be buying all three products in full sizes asap!",2
I never leave reviews but last night I put it on before bed.  i woke up and the deep lines under my eyes are nearly gone. I've been looking everywhere for a good eye cream. I will not but anything else from now on. wow,1
"I never really could figure out lashes. I previously brought lashes from a major department store and just couldn't fit them properly to which I would just give up. BTW, I have hooded eyes! Decided to try Huda lashes from doing some research, Olivia lashes were recommended for hooded eyes. These fit my eyes perfectly, are so easy to put on! Used duo adhesive. Lashes look so beautiful on my big eyes with hooded lids haha. I think I have to buy multiple pairs now!",1
I Never Really Use Exfoliating Masks Because Of How Rough A Lot Of Them Can Be On My Skin But This One I Try To Use Real Gently Because I Do Have Dry Sensitive Skin Makes Me Feel Real Smooth And Brighter After The First Use,0
"I never struggled with skin problems until I started preparing for law school about 3 years ago. After stress (and crazy hormonal acne caused by it) made me cake on makeup for 3 years, my acne only got worse. I've cycled through dozens of different products for solutions. But my hands alone just didn't cleanse enough, normal acne serums and Clarisonic brushes only dried out my skin, and sanitizing cleansing towels took too much extra time. I've had my Luna mini 2 for a month or so now, and, coupled with double-cleansing (with Farmacy's Green Clean balm), it has completely changed the texture of my skin for good. I have actually gone into public wearing only sunscreen and maybe some Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage (concealer). I am so, so grateful. Thank you, Foreo!",0
I never used a toner that I felt did anything for my skin. This has made a real difference within two weeks!  The melasma and scars from medication have either gone or improved dramatically. I mix this with my serum at night and have used it on my sensitive skin with extremely minimal irritation ( a small amount of stinging that dissipates as it dries). This has been a godsend for me. ( I paid for this product. I am not an employee of either the producer or the seller.),4
I never write reviews because never ever works for me and I usually end up returning it. I've only been using this for about a week but I can see difference. Nothing will ever make the crepey lines eyes ever completely go away unless I have an eye lift (which is not happening any time soon) but this is as good you'll get. I was using Obagi eye cream which was good but not great. This works on milia too I've noticed. My only complaint is the packaging. There must be a better way!,2
"I never write reviews but I had to write about how much I love this foundation. This is my first powder foundation. I usually us the Make Up Forever liquid foundation. I am so glad I stumbled upon this. It lasted all day today in 90 degree weather. I only needed to blot twice throughout the day. I even got a compliment on how nice my skin was. The woman actually thought I wasn't wearing makeup. For someone who has a lot of hyper pigmentation, that was a huge compliment! I also didn't need to use much to get the coverage I wanted. I used the white side of the sponge and lightly went over my face twice. It was quick and easy! The sponge is perfect for application too. I am in love with this foundation! A must try!",1
"I never write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled too. If I could give this zero stars, I would.  Not only did this give me some weird  bump under the corner of my eye, it was itchy and slightly painful. It also enhanced my wrinkles. I chucked this product right in the garbage!",2
"I never write reviews but this product actually changed my life lol. Also I'm not getting payed to write this...I'm just a normal person lol. I had painful cystic acne and nothing cleared it up. I tried many creams from the dermatologist, many brands from sephora (sunday riley, fresh, murad, tatcha and many more) NOTHING worked. I went in for a consultation for accutane and was about to start it, but I thought I would try one more thing. And I am beyond happy I did!!! I finally have pain free skin and feel comfortable without wearing makeup when I leave the house! I will use this forever!! Thank you Ole!!!",4
"i never write reviews but this should get taken off the market, ive tried to take these on and off for months. i always stop because of how sick they make me feel, not worth the 40 dollars. these make you feel worse than having a hang over. STAY AWAY!",4
"I never write reviews for makeup but I can't praise this lip stain enough.  It feels so comfortable on, lasts for hours and has great pigment.  The color is natural yet dramatic.  I hope this product or color offering never discontinues.",2
"Influenster and Armani sent the #508 Lip Maestro for me to try.  Before I tried it, I had mistakenly thought it was a liquid lipstick. If you buy it expecting a full coverage, long wear, complete color liquid lipstick, you will be cross. However, if you want a satin, semi-sheer mousse lipstick, you might like it.  I had issues getting the color even--the mousse formula was a little patchy. with this oink nude, it wasn't bad, but I could see a darker color being quite difficult.  I purposely skipped lip liner so you can see--this is not the type of liquid lipstick that has full definition and color in one. \nWho it is for:  people who dislike the dryness of a long wear but also avoid gloss, someone who likes a semi-sheer satin finish with a smooth texture, someone who has time to fiddle with getting the color even.\nWho it is not for: people who like a strong, defined lip, folks who need a smudgeproof formula.\n\nDisclosure: I received this product complimentary from\xa0Giorgio Armani for sampling purposes. This is my honest review.",4
"Initially, I liked this serum mainly because it was cooling when I applied it but I was not too keen on the fragrance and it did not help my rosacea.  I did not notice any difference - for the price, I expected some results.  I will finish my bottle but will not be purchasing again.",2
Initially I love the simple matte black packaging. The colors are very versitile for many different looks. I couldnt smell anything which is great im not a fan of scented make up. I dont like the shimmer in every color though. The texture is very light & spongy & glides on better with my finger than with a brush. The color payoff is pretty rewarding but feels like its going to smudge easy. I wore is for 6hours and it didn't move to much kept my Smokey eye pretty well intact. I would purchase this product simply for the travels I go on light weight and stable in my bag with gorgeous colors to go with other palettes i use frequently! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1
"Initially I wasn't a huge fan of this eye treatment. It brightened up my under eyes, which I thought is was nice, but didn't really see a point - I could use concealer and get better and longer lasting results. However after a few uses I've come to appreciate this product. As a mom it's difficult to find the time to get made up so this product helps on the no make up days. I apply the eye treatment to my under eyes and even on other parts of my face that need brightening using a beauty blender and instantly I look more refreshed. This isn't going to be as long lasting as putting on concealer but it's a lot less fussing around with blending and setting. As for the treatment part of this I honestly haven't seen much of a difference.",1
"Initially when I applied this foundation it looked beautiful. Smooth, good medium to full coverage, and a nice slightly-more-matte-than-natural finish. The color 2CR (022) was perfect on my light, cool toned, very pink complexion. My skin is not an easy color to match! It felt great- light, not cakey, and really looked like perfect skin. My large pores were mimimized (I am 42 years old, and have had oily skin my whole life. Oily skin = large pores). I was thrilled! After about 2 hours, I noticed it really wearing off on my nose and chin. By 3 hours, it was totally gone from my nose and chin. The rest of my face was still flawless. Strange, since foundations that break up on me usually do so in all of my oily areas, not just there. Over the past month I have tried numerous primers, setting powders and sprays, but nothing seems to help keep this foundation on my nose or chin. I have given up. I emailed Dior beauty for suggestions on how to make this foundation work for me, and they simply suggested that I get the Diorskin Forever Undercover foundation instead. This product was sent me me complimentary for review purposes. All opinions expressed are my own.",2
In just under 2 weeks my face was cleared up! I constantly get breakouts despite trying different makeup and cleansing products. When I started using this product my face got really oily and it seemed like I broke out even more. I stuck with it to see if it would get better and had amazing results! Not everyone's skin will react the same but stick with it at least a week or 2 before deciding if it really works for you. You can definitely feel the enzymes working and for those with sensitive skin it may sting a tiny bit in some areas but once you rinse your skin will feel incredibly smooth! I follow it with a dermalogica moisturizer with SPF 50+ and haven't really had issues with clogged pores or dry skin since. Will definitely keep purchasing!,2
"In LOVE with this product. I was trying to simplify my beauty routine and wanted to combine my lotion/primer steps into one product. Found it! I originally had the Origins Primer, which is a couple dollars cheaper, but to have a 2 in 1 product from the same brand? sold. This lotions leaves a soft matte look that works beautifully under foundation. Doesn't break me out - while keeping my skin moisturized. The size is small but it lasted me 5 months of daily use. Highly recommend",0
"In my ongoing pursuit to simplify, I've tried several different bronze/glow powders to use as my one and done product for cheeks, eyes, and overall glow/color.  This Guerlain compact really checks all the boxes and while I don't care for the scent, it disappears immediately upon application, lasts all day, doesn't oxidize or get muddy looking.",3
"In order for this scrub to work,  you need to get the top layer off first. Otherwise you won't feel it exfoliating.  After you get the top layer off, this scrub works great to smooth out the lips. I like that it is so convenient to use comparing to those traditional sugar scrub pot but I would prefer the diameter  this to be slightly small so I don't get to scrub everything around my mouth (sometimes my nose).",1
"I normally don’t buy concealers because I feel like it looks so obvious when I wear it. With this shisheido concealer I finally feel like I can wear a concealer. What I loved about it was how smooth it was and it was very easy to blend so much so that it almost look like my skin but way better. It’s a very good amount of coverage so a little goes a long way I just stab a few dots under my eye or where I need concealer  and I just blend it with a brush or with a sponge. The overall look that he gave me was that I had no bags under my eyes no dark spots and it made me look like I was awake. I really love this product and I will use it religiously!  It did not leave my under eyes caked up, it was very smooth and consistent when blending!",0
"I normally don't write reviews, but I want to aware the first time users.\n\nSo, I always dreamed of waking up with no dark circles or hollowness around my eyes and I was really excited for this product. I wear foundation when I go out (under my eye) and I swear, this made my skin under my eye look so grey and dry. I still wasn't sure whether it was due to this and I stopped it for a while and then returned back to it. Became worse. My skin turned back to normal with applying excessive vaseline and moisturizer around my eyes, and I am never buying this again. Honestly, I'm so surprised that something for under-eye was made so strong. \n\nBe careful, don't use if your skin is dry or combination (especially if you think your under eye skin is thin).",0
"I normally use They're Real mascara, but after reading reviews on this one I had to try it.  Not only is it less expensive, but it goes on so smoothly and does not clump.  It's great to lengthen and adds definition.  This is my new fav mascara.",1
"I noticed a bit of a difference after the first use, and then 8 weeks later, a huge difference!  Twice/week, and I would say my blackheads are nearly non-existent.  I use it almost completely dry, just wetting the nubby tip and massaging for a good minute or two over my t-zone.  My skin looks radiant.  Tube is still half full after 2 months.",4
"In the beginning I thought this mascara is too wet and clumpy. There seems to be too much mascara on the wand. But after it being open for a while, it got better and I was able to work with it over my Dior lash primer. And I used Maybelline define a lash to separate my lashes. It's a lot of steps but really takes me only a few minutes and my short, Asian lashes turns into black, curly, thick lashes that will last me all night.",3
"In the clean world, this is the best makeup remover cleanser- for the price. Lasts a really long time (I use one or two pumps) and it smells nice, takes off my makeup, does not leave me greasy and the price is decent when compared to other clean products.",1
"In the hundred years I’ve been alive ;-) I’ve gone thru plenty of mascaras.  Most are great for a week or two and stop working.  I picked this up during a pre-order and it is still great!  Plump, thick, long lashes on this aging girl.  Add a primer and my lashes look 40!  Bonus: traveling with this mascara doesn’t dry it out faster.",3
In the past I thought all powders were the same. Abh has certainly proved me wrong. It keeps my foundation from creasing and keeps my Tzone shine free for at least 8 hours. l received this product free for testing purposes.,4
"In the top ingredients is Denatured Alcohol.  I had wondered why it dried my skin out and stung after I washed my face and used toner.  I couldn't read the ingredients on the bottle (too small), so I came here and found out about the denatured alcohol.  I know it's bad for my skin and with the stinging and drying of skin, I can see why.  I also broke out more after I used this a few times.  Beware.",3
"I often want to do both a mud mask and a chemical peel but don't have time for both so this is a great multi purpose mask. However, I'd say it's more for someone with sensitive skin as advertised. I am used to much stronger AHAs so I did not see much of an effect on me. I would still recommend to any sensitive skin types that would like to unclog pores and detox their skin, perfect after a sweaty day at the gym or a full face makeup day. I received this product complimentary for testing.",4
I only bought this because of the good reviews and I absolutely regret the purchase. The eyeliner doesn't last and definitely is not made for the waterline. It is also not recommended for people who wear contacts as it smudges,1
"I only have one other full size Stila eyeshadow, in rose gold. it literally applied perfectly every time, but these ones are somehow not the same. the darkest colour dried down in my crease with absolutely no Sparkle, just a dirty-looking brown stain. I tried eye primer , I tried glitter glue, I tried using a brush , I tried using a finger , I tried using the applicator and nothing helped. for $15 it's not worth it to take back , I'm going to keep playing with it and keep my fingers crossed because the colours Swatch beautifully..... these minis are like getting one and a half of the full-size product, for just under half the price of a full one! any tips would be welcomed......??",4
"I only used it 3 or 4 times and only used it for the outer corners of the eyes for precision (I used other pencils to fill in the upper lines and the waterlines).  I was so surprised why it was done so fast; at first I thought maybe I got a used one at the store and planned to buy another one because I like its small tip, until I read the reviews about how little it is.  I paid almost $20 for just 3 or 4 times of very light uses.  Totally rip-off, I won't buy it again.",3
"i only use it for a few days now. this eye cream acts almost like a concealer and brightener as one. i like it because it doesn't irritate my eyes whenever i accidentally rub it and make me tear up of nowhere. but i wish it doesn't rub off easily whenever i put other sunscreen on top of it or clump. also, it tingles a little whenever i put it on, is it normal?",1
I order and use many products from various manufacturers and am always looking for something new to fight fine lines and wrinkles.  I received a trial of this product and of course tried it.  I just first off tell you that I have never had any reactions to any product I've used.  I applied this retinol vita C Power serum before going to bed.  In the morning my skin felt fine and thought all was good.  I did not apply the next night as I read you should ease into this product and was planning on applying every other day.  However on that third day my skin was peeling and raw. My skin around my eyes was raw and red.  I've never had such a reaction to any product so my advice is to be aware!  I can't imagine what would have happened if I applied two nights in a row.,4
"I ordered Deep Rose. It's beautiful on my fair skin and with my Red Hair. I just ordered 2 more. Was not a selection for it in the review. If you only have a little of product out, it will not break. No issues at all with that. I may even order a few more before I can't get anymore. I don't wear base , just lipstick and eye liner & Mascara. I own prob 50 diff shades of lip products and this is now my favorite. love it.",3
"I ordered the ""Light"" color and the CC cream inside the packaging was much darker than what I would expect it to be. I took it back to the store and the individual working actually held it up to a full sized product. The item in my packaging matched the ""medium shade"" that was being sold in store and did not look anything like the full sized ""light"" shade. She opened another package of this item (cc soul), just to see if mine was a fluke, and the cc cream in the other package, although labeled ""light"" was also a ""medium"". Returned this item. Please know that if you order this or buy it in store, you are NOT receiving the correct shade. I am very dissapointed because i was looking forward to this item. Please Sephora, correct this issue!",0
"I ordered these online because I was looking for a quality over quantity basic set. I use all the brushes in their set, I've had these for a couple of months now and recently washed them with baby shampoo now they look like new. Very pleased with the quality. I use the big one for setting powder, the angled for blush and bronzer, the highlight one is to highlight the cheekbones, the puffy eye shadow one is for eyeshadow, and the tiny one is for tiny highlight such as cupid bow, brow bones and inner eye corners.",1
"I ordered the shade nudist and was very excited to try it because the colour was exactly what I was looking for . However, after receiving and applying the liner, the colour was COMPLETELY different on, than it appears anywhere online so I am returning it. But i would like to say that for this price, the quality is much better than a lot of the much more expensive liners, so overall it is a good purchase IF you find your shade.  It glides on nicely, does not get chalkey and does not make your lips appear dry like some other liners.  For those wondering, the shade that applied to my lips was like a very light purple/ beige/greyish colour. I tried switching up my makeup shades to see if perhaps it was the tone of my foundation /powder/ make up.. but no, it was the product itself. I definitely can understand some variation in shades, but this was a COMPLETELY different colour, and yes it was the correct liner & box that I received. Not sure if this only happened to me, or some others as well, but I have light neutral skin, blue eyes and blonde/light brown hair at the moment and the colour looked waaay  different on me- nothing close to ""pinky neutral"".",1
"I ordered this lipstick on a whim (as I do most of my makeup buys lol). I have become especially drawn to bright vivid pink colors for some reason.  (I am normally a blue red or greige gal).  anyway, the lipstick has amazing color payoff and feels comfortable.  the packaging could be a bit better (as my order arrived shifted to the side and somewhat messy). I spoke with customer service (sent them a photo of the damaged goods) and resolved this issue with no problem.",4
"I ordered this palette recently and it just arrived yesterday. I love the shades - I feel like it would be a perfect everyday eyeshadow palette. Unfortunately though, there is quite some fallout from the eyeshadow. It's not like drugstore makeup level fallout, but it's not as high quality as the Huda Beauty obsessions pallettes I already have and use. I'm not too pleased with the fallout, so I MAY return or exchange it for another palette.",0
"I order this every year at holiday time. I have been using mineral veil forever. However they have clearly changed the formula because it is now a horrific orange color and is completely unwearable. I am so disappointed. I ordered a normal size product to see if it was the same orange color, and indeed it is. Don't know what bare minerals is doing but it's really unfortunate. If they don't correct the issue will need to find a new setting powder. Really frustrated and bummed.",3
"I orginally received one in the sephora play box not sephora brand, but truly loved it so bought some of these on what I assume clearance which sucks! I truly love these sleeping masks and have tried several and love them all. \nI'm so hoping sephora will just redo packaging to a sealable package and keeps these around awhile. I've come to find Sephora actually has very good skincare and makeup unlike what I had heard through other's. I sadly canceled my sephora play due to a payment glitch but have enjoyed being able to try a few sephora brand products.",2
"I originally got a small sample of this, and after one use I knew I had to purchase the full size. though it is pricey, a little goes a long way. I've been using this once a week and love the way my skin looks and feels. after each use, it looks brighter and feels incredibly soft. I follow the directions exactly as printed and have had no bad effects. everyone's skin is different, so I do recommend you sampling it before committing. I love the fact this has vitamin c, the smell of step 1 is so sweet. besides the soft and bright skin, I have noticed a more even skin complexion; I do have sun spots from previous sun exposure. I have found the perfect peel to add to my regime. it does feel like a scrub but not too abrasive. when you are using step 1, I recommend you massage it evenly on your face. don't just concentrate on one area to avoid redness afterwards, scrub it evenly.  I 100% reccomend this!! definitely holy grail!",4
"I originally got this from a friend who didn't want it, used it without thinking much of it. Smell wasn't my favorite, but it didn't bother me so when I ran out I got a less expensive toner because it's a step I don't care to spend a lot of money on. Then I got pregnant, my skin was pretty lack luster but I blamed it on the hormones. My nose got perpetually red at the tip, inflamed no matter what I did, and makeup wasn't sitting well on my skin. That's when I was looking through pictures of the year before and noticing how amazing my skin had been, and that the only major change I had made was the toner. So I bought this a week ago and my nose is healing, my skin is already looking luminous, and acting better in every way. I'm sold for life.",1
"I originally received a sample & honestly liked the way it worked with my makeup routine, which honestly shocked me. A little pricey compared to my other skin mists but bought it anyways & I still am loving it.",4
"I originally received this moisturizer in a special 40+ skin care box I purchased. I now keep this moisturizer in my everyday stock! I have sensitive skin but have had no problems with irritation. This feels like it moisturizers on a cellular level, my skin stays happy all day! I also love that this is a ""clean"" product!",4
"I own all 3 shades and wear them alone.  Although I may get a compliment or to I honestly do not think this is different than the other 50 glosses I own.  I will say that the finish feels good across my lips but my Laneige gloss does too.  If you buy it, its purely for the name.",4
"i own a LOT of eyeshadow palettes and i must say this has quickly become my favorite fall palette i like it even more than the gingerbread palette, its super cute and compact, smells yummy and i use every single shade and it gives me the perfect cozy fall look!",1
I own a lot of nude or neutal lipsticks and I got these to wear over the top to change them up.  I have to say that I am really impressed with these glosses.  They do not feather and are the perfect consistency.  I find I often wear them alone and love the shine.  Highly recommend!,3
"I own every palette PMcG has released and this is an embarrassment.  This pathetic plastic case houses five small shadows that are of high quality and blend well.  Honestly, no one wants to pull out this disgraceful looking palette.  Save your money and buy the real deal!",3
"I own the full sizes of the first glosses to be released, and I love them. When I saw this set I was psyched to own the formula I love in other colors. I was very wrong. This formula is completely different from the original glosses. It's full of glitter, which sticks to your lips and gets all over your face. I HATE glitter.  I scrubbed this gloss off over an hour ago and there are still flakes of glitter on my lips and chin. I could not hate this formula any more if I tried.",4
"I personally have a combination skin of dry to normal, but very sensitive, with that being The color I tested was golden honey which was the lightest of the three that I received. My skin tone is light to medium with neutral undertones. I feel that this applies nicely and is buildable, but I also feel that it remained tacky on my face. I am not 100% sure that if you have dry skin, that this foundation is for you. I feel that this foundation might work well by individuals with oil/combination skin. I don't feel it's a full coverage foundation but more a medium coverage. I have rosacea and was still able to see the redness show through, after attempting to build the foundation without it being caked for I don't like to apply too much.\nOverall, I would truly like to try this again with the proper color and I would like to have more time to build it up to cover my redness.\n I received a sample of this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest review.\n \n@sephora @Bobbi Brown @Influenster",3
"I picked these (Sweet Pea) up at my local Sephora because they didn't have much else to pick from; unfortunately, they are the worst lashes I have ever spent money on. The band is NOT flexible in the least and looks like someone glued bristles to the tops of my eyelids when applied. They are also not at all comfortable or stay in the inner eye area properly no matter how much glue is used. I am so disappointed that I wasted $14 on these. The Natalia are beautiful as well as the Azalea, but these are just a total MISS.",4
"I picked this as a gift with purchase a few weeks ago and the claims sounded awesome. I get my best lash results with waterproof formulas because I have stick straight lashes that point down so I have to use a curler. I've tried it several times, and it always ends the same: Pulls out my curl, not enough volume, negligible lengthening, and not as black as my fav drugstore mascaras. I've tried going in for a lighter coat and no luck. My lashes are picky so it may work for someone else but it's a no for me.",4
"I picked this concealer in the ginger shade to brighten my undereyes. The formula is matte, blendable, comfortable and does not crease if applied correctly. The component is simple but elegant. I took one star away because at times when my undereyes are dark from insomnia, I have found that it didn't conceal as much as I'd like. I have to go back in with corrector and follow w this concealer. I was hoping for a one step approach but I'm still happy w my purchase.",1
"I picked up in store for my birthday gift.  I had never tried it before.  It has a gel/cream texture and not too heavy, not too light.  It sinks into my skin well and does not dry it out or leave it greasy.  Very nice : )",3
"I planned to purchase the 1oz Ole Truth Serum for $49, but saw this set for $50.  I basically paid $1 to try three new products.  the Truth Serum is my holy grail product I've been using daily for years, but now I've fallen in love with the brightening moisturizer,  eye cream, and primer.  I wear little to no makeup for my job and have received several compliments about my glowing skin in the past week.  Thanks Ole Henriksen!!",2
"I prefer tinted moisturizers to full coverage products on a daily basis, so I had high hopes for this product. But alas, I had to return this. The fragrance is super strong and lingered on my skin. It's a water-based product, but felt like rubbing silicone and oil into my skin. Despite trying it with a sponge, brush, and my fingers, it never seemed to set well on my skin, and I looked like a greasy mess within a couple hours (and I don't have oily skin; it's primarily just normal-combo). It didn't break me out, despite the strong scent, but that's about the only positive I can say for this product.",1
"I pretty much have everything that Melt puts out and have never been so disappointed with a product of theirs until I tried this eyeliner. It was chunky, flaky, didn't dry well with layers and transfered. It felt very dry like it had been sitting around for a long time. I cannot imagine they would put out a formula so dry and chunky. The applicator was alright, but could be better. Overall just very disappointed with this product. :/",4
"I previously purchased the All-Day Hydrator- Hydrate and Glow moisturizer but I found it very heavy on my skin. It felt oily and wasn't comfortable, so I thought I would give this a try. I'm glad I did because I found it was hydrating but didn't leave my skin feeling very oily. I have combo skin and find a lot of moisturizers are pretty heavy on my skin. This was perfect and I'm happy I found a decently priced moisturizer that is effective for my skin!",4
"I previously returned the Modern Renaissance palette, a nice palette but the colours were too warm for me and the shadows faded to nothing by lunch time, and have been patiently waiting for ABH to come out with something like this. I'm a sucker for purple, and the neutrals all work well to help build a cohesive look. The colour builds nicely and lasts all day, even without primer. There are a few shades that are a bit chalky on the lid and need to be applied carefully (Base is my biggest issue) but there's way less kickback and fallout than I had with the MR. Overall, I'm really happy with this palette.",2
"I primary bought because of the packaging. very pretty, wears well. doesn't read 'orange' to me on my very pale skin. has a sheen like a balm, but a pigmented one. the only negative for me is the chemical smell. after hours of wearing, it's still apparent.",4
"I purchased 2 colors one for summer and winter. I am a full coverage queen!! I was hesitant to purchase, and I'm glad I did. I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin. This formula doesnt irritate or make my skin breakout. The coverage is buildable but I am learning that I dont have to cover every flaw. I dont end up a oily mess  by the end of the day. The foundation doesnt breakdown or slip off my skin. I will be repurchasing.",4
I purchased 3 of these. 2 full size and 1 mini. the first one was great and I just finished it. the second one I went to open and NOTHING came out. so i opened the mini and SAME THING. fresh out of the box with fully dried up product,0
"I purchased 3 of these that seemed to be dark enough on my medium skin tone according to swatches online and models. I tried all 3 (She's Secure/Unapologetic/Independent) and they make me look like a ghost. I gave it a couple of stars because I really like the formula. If only they catered to people with a little more skin pigmentation, this would be a great item.",3
I purchased a 1.7 oz jar in September and I still have product good for a week.  I love this cream. My type of moisturizer for the evening.  I watched Charlotte's video for proper application.  My skin feels and looks great the next day. Will definitely purchase again.,4
"I purchased both Vida and Muerte and Melt eyeshadows are phenomenal as always. All shades are very pigmented and you don't need to wet the brush to get a foiled effect from their shimmers. They do have some kick back but not a deal breaker for me. Melt's colour stories are always so amazing, highly recommend this for anyone who wants to play with colour!",1
"I purchased during a VIB sale. I am really into hydrating and moisturizing lip products for my sensitive skin. i was drawn to the gold flakes lol. the smell is pleasant and the product feel nice on initial use, but it doesnt last for long. i kept it and use in the morning.",2
I purchased Master Flash. This product remains a bit sticky after application. The scent is not exactly like Bum Bum Cream. It leaves more of a shimmer than glittery. I do like that it is not just clumpy glitter. Not happy that the Sol De Janerio charges $10 less than Sephora :( I think this size is small for the price. I have used mine maybe 3 times and it is halfway gone. I like odd colors so of course I love the bluish shimmers.,2
"I purchased one of these and I think now I'm going to have to stock up before it goes away after the holidays.\nThis is the only moisturizer I enjoy using (ESPECIALLY in winter, sometimes I switch to the aqua bomb for hot months) and with this set you are getting the cleanser and the eye bomb for free since the moisturizer itself in this size is $38. This is the first time I've ever tried this eye cream and cleanser and they are both also amazing and I'm now hooked.\nBUY THIS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALREADY USE THE TRUE CREAM.",0
"I purchased Roller Lash at my local Sephora.  I wanted a mascara that looked and felt clean and non-goopy.  Roller Lash is better in those respects than many other mascaras I've tried recently.  It lifts and curls the lashes and adds good length (both, also important to me).  Not quite as much separation of lashes as I'd like, but overall, I like this mascara and have purchased a second one.",3
I purchased the 6 smoky pallete...wish it had a warm blending color for brown skin tones. The browns are lighter and muddy so I use a blending color from the jackie aina pallete. that is why 3 stars for me. love the mirror.,2
I purchased the Electric Pink and let me say it was absolutely terrible especially for the price. Those blue reflective pearls look stunning in the container but are non existent when you actually apply it on the lips. The gloss itself feels like oil and  disappears less then 4 minute after initially applying.,0
I purchased the Mauve，Smokey，Coral and Amethyst，unbelievably，they are made in China，and I do love her obsessions series palettes，I think the ones I purchased are very good quality，they r soft，belendable and have color stories. Overall，I really love her Obsessions palettes，obviouly，that id why I purchased so many and so many times.,4
"I purchased the mini size not knowing if I would get good results with this one because I had been using Blinc tube mascara for long time.  Wanted change because Blinc doesn't flake or smear, but it also gives no volume to lashes.  My lashes are short, thin and straight so I need something to hold a curl, give volume and length.  This product satisfies all 3 and does not flake off during the day.  Been using for 2 weeks now and not a single complaint.   I like the wand which easily coats each lash and separates them at same time.  My day is long in terms of makeup wear (15  hours) and no raccoon eyes or flakes around the eyes.  This product is easy to remove using my Neutrogena eye makeup remover.  This is my new mascara now.",3
"I purchased these ACV pads based on the rave reviews and have been using them religiously every other day (I have thick skin that responds well to exfoliants) for the past two months. They feel good on my face but made my neck rash out like crazy, so lesson learned there. I'm almost finished the pack of 60 and honestly I don't see any real difference in my skin. Yes, these pads are refreshing, but sadly I see no improvement in my breakouts or hyperpigmentation / mild acne scarring. This product ""does no harm,"" but it's not worth spending ~$2 per pad. I'd be better off making my own AVC / lemon juice solution at home and keeping it in the fridge. Needless to say will not be repurchasing.",2
"I purchased these because they were so cute, and was surprised when the balm turned out to be wonderful! I go through tons of lip balm every winter here in CO, and these are great. Very moisturizing, and protect my lips quite well. Will order more when back in stock.",4
"I purchased the set, which included this serum. A store employee suggested this to me for my hyperpigmentation. She said it really helped her so I bought into it. When I first started using it, I was using too much and it made my skin very oily. I cut down the amount I was using and that remedied the oiliness. I finished the bottle and did not notice much of a difference on my hyperpigmentation. It did make my pores appear small, and have some sort of glow. I repurchased the kit because my mom liked the glow it gave her skin. We have both moved on from this product now and will not be repurchasing it.",1
"I purchased the trial size of this product.  With all the good reviews I was excited to try it.  I found it to be very clumpy, a lot of mascara on the brush.  Trying to separate the lashes I got pieces of mascara all over my face.  Didn't work for me",3
"I purchased the Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask in a kit with the moisturizer and mask.  I just used the sleeping mask and was very surprised at the texture and consistency at first.  Upon application, it was very smooth and velvety - nice to the touch.  The following morning, my skin felt and looked amazing!  I can't wait to use it more to see the cumulative effects!",3
"I purchased this after Jess from JAM beauty recommend this, even after she warned it may be bad for oily skin and I am an oily mess at the end of the day.\n\nI picked this up during the VIB sale and have been so far impressed. There virtually was no creasing when applied with an eyeshadow primer (I used Ulta brand) after about 9 hours of wear. \n\nI apply a thin layer with my finger and after letting my primer set for a minute or so. Marie Antoinette is a beautiful tan/brown with gold shimmer and NOT glitter. I think it goes well with my brown eyes and light skin. This shade is super work friendly and looks amazing with a subtle eyeshadow liner. You can quickly put it on in the morning with no fuss.",0
"I purchased this after using and loving the trial size.  Squalane is one of my new favorite ingredients.  I do a 2-step cleanse (this as 2), but this works on its own.  It's viscous enough to melt away long wearing makeup then cleans away nicely.  It leaves my sensitive, dry, post-menopausal skin feeling clean and comfortable.",3
"I purchased this along with a lot of the other Tatcha line. For the first couple of uses this product worked well however this product has a higher ph level, making you more prone to breakouts. It did minimize my blackheads and leave my skin feeling clean.  I will say, a little goes a long way so the product with last, however the simple ingredients in this can be found in other products for half the price. Another issue is that this product is in a jar, which means the ingredients in it will not remain stable because you are constantly exposing the product to air, this makes the product less effective overtime. Save your money! I wish I did more research before purchasing honestly. I will not be repurchasing when it is finished off.",1
"I purchased this a month ago after using up the free sample. I love the texture, packaging. It's clean and K beauty. You get a lot of product for the price and it sinks in well. Isn't greasy and doesn't make my eyes water. There is an adjustment period. Will purchase again.",1
"I purchased this and found it was way too heavy for my combo skin. It's not a bad hydrator and does moisturize, but for me it was too much.If you have dry skin or don't find a lot of moisturizers heavy on your skin, this is for you. But if you find this too heavy/oily, I recommend using the Matte moisturizer in the Sephora collection, it was way better for me.",4
"I purchased this and read reviews when I got back home. I was like, ""Oh, no, what did I do?"" Some reviews were so negative. I immediately tried one that night, and spent the next four days using each of the other ones. \n\nSome reviews said they were goopy. I find that if you run the applicator along the inside of the tube while removing the applicator, you don't get an abundance of product which means...no goopy effect.\n\nSome reviews said a few of these had glitter particles in them which they could feel on their lips. When I rubbed my lips together, I didn't feel any chunks of glitter. Each gloss felt smooth on my lips.\n\nSome reviews said the color would wear off and they'd have glitter spots leftover on their lips. That didn't happen to me. Each gloss lasted all day, with the exception of reapplying (sometimes) after I ate. Each gloss was long lasting on my lips.\n\nSome said the formula isn't as the original gloss bombs. I have one original one and these minis seem to be the same formula.\n\nMy complexion in tan and my lips have a natural pigmentation that's accentuated, while taking on the color of gloss. I know that may sound strange. Each of these is a sheer wash of color, looks slightly differently on my lips to me, but may appear the same to someone else's naked eye. So, if you're looking for extremely different colors, you may want to go with a more pigmented gloss set. If you don't mind subtle color differences, this is the set for you.\n\nI keep one in my purse, one in my car, one in my travel makeup case. Because the colors show up similar, you can put on one in the morning and reapply using a different one without looking crazy. \n\nPrice point seems to be what you'd pay for two full-size gloss bombs and a mini one. I do think this set is worth the price. I also like them being minis because I'll actually use up an entire tube.\n\nI do recommend this set. The bad reviews? Maybe they got a bad batch.",2
"I purchased this as a trial.  I haven't found any liner that works for me.  I tear a lot so liners tend to disappear quickly, not lasting the morning.  I tried the red first.  After two days, the gel was completely gone!  I twisted the brown liner just to see.  I was surprised to discover the gel was less than one-half inch long.  No wonder the red was gone.  I thought I broke the tip of the red one, but they are all very short.  Too bad because I really intended to take this on my trip.  The liner does not have staying power either.  By the time I was ready to leave the house in the morning, the liner was already disappearing.",3
"I purchased this beautiful color on October 20, 2019.  Six weeks later on Thanksgiving, the bullet broke off (and it wasn't from rolling it down too low, (I've been wearing lipstick a LONG, LONG time!)  Customer Service was not helpful in getting me a replacement.  When did Sephora stop standing behind its products that break after 6 weeks?",4
"I purchased this brush THREE YEARS ago and it has not shed a single hair. Not once. I use it almost daily and it is by far one of the best brush purchases I have ever made. It's super soft, perfect density (I love using it for blush application) and is clearly well made and extremely durable. Highly recommend, mine is 3 years old and still like new!!",1
"I purchased this during the vib sale, and honestly I would purchase again at full price. These certainly are minis, so be prepared for that, but I don't mind the size. I'm not even halfway through a mini Bite lipstick I got a year ago, so...these won't last as long because I adore every colour so much. Highly recommend.",2
"I purchased this during the VIB sale and I'm thinking of getting a backup. It is very hydrating and gives a nice youthful glow. Plus, awesome ingredients! In comparison to Glow recipe watermelon spray, this is superior.",2
"I purchased this earlier in the year when it was in a white opaque bottle. The pump stopped making the product foam, so I had to repurchased. The original that I had purchased seems to be no longer available, so I got this new version. The new is sub-par at best. The previous version was bronzed so that you could see where you needed to further blend. This version does not and I find it to be streaky and not nearly as long-lasting. The original was 5  stars. This one, not so much.",3
"I purchased this foundation in May on vacation in Orlando. It was blazing hot and I was wondering if this would hold up, but it looked so good in the store I rolled the dice. It was amazing! It lasted all day in Disney world in the blazing heat. I bought the ABH foundation a few months later, but this is so much better for me. It's so radiant and natural looking with perfect coverage. I wouldn't call it FULL coverage, but it's fantastic. I'm on my second bottle. this is my go to every day foundation and the shade is perfect. It can be a little tricky to find a good cool pink tone without looking overly pink but this is it. Love it.",1
"I purchased this from Sephora after purchasing the tea tree trio and wanting to try a different oil.  I LOVE the Biossance skincare line and want to try it all! (I have actually purchased several other products from their website that Sephora doesn't carry).  I have used this oil on my face, hands, body and even my hair and it's really nice. It absorbs nicely and is hydrating. But, it's not great for my face.  It left me oily, which I already am naturally, and I need something to help finish oil, but promote it. This is actually great hair oil and helps tame flyaways and hydrate my hair. I would recommend but not for those with oily skin to use as a face oil.",3
"I purchased this hoping it would have that glassy like look, since it had unreal high shine in its name. Unfortunately I was not impressed and ended up returning it. The lipgloss was not as glassy as I hoped. It didn't really volumize my lips much. I felt that the texture of the gloss became tacky after some time. I also did not enjoy the dental minty scent as others have described. The sublime color was really pretty and complemented my olive skin tone and the component was very elegant though. Its applicator was easy to use as well. However this lipgloss was expensive and I was not impressed with its texture so I returnee it bx I loved my Marc Jacobs Enamored Hi-Shine gloss instead.",1
"I purchased this in a travel size since they do tend to go bad after a time and was so disappointed in a few ways: 1) original tinted moisturizer was 30mls for $20 (within this past year) and this is 25mls for $24.00 (not much bigger than a deluxe sample of skincare). 2) coverage is not like the original at all-this is very thin and very light coverage (and that's being generous) and 3) I used to purchase the original in sand (for over 10  years) which was 3W2, this new one in sand is 3N1. Don't give a product the same name if its a different shade. Finally it gave my skin a shine I don't like. The only reason for 3 stars is the increase in SPF from 20-30. Will not purchase again, nor recommend if your looking for any type of buildable coverage. BTW-I paid for this product and this is an honest review.",3
"I purchased this in the hopes of finding a light make up remover and a toner that would be easy to put on at night to clean off my skin and prep me for bed. It did remove my makeup (I only really wear eyeliner and occasionally mascara, never any foundation or whatever) but it also left the most tacky, sticky, and tight feeling to my face. The bottle says it's a no rinse solution but I couldn't stand the feeling and had to wash it off. I've tried leaving it on overnight on multiple but it just feels so terrible that i've had to get up and wash it off.",1
"I purchased this kit because I had tried out the cleanser and cream for my Birthday gift from sephora and I really loved the two. This kit is really nice and I love that it gives a full skin care routine. My skin feels very moisturized and it looks great. I love these products, I do see my self purchasing the full size in the future.",1
"I purchased this product along with the Drunk Elephant baby facial. At first I thought I had put a large amount of product on my face and it made my face feel very sticky. I decreased the amount of pumps I would used to only one pump per use on my entire face and my face still felt extremely sticky like if you've been sweating for days. Not only does it make your skin feel sticky, but it also makes your skin very shiny! As my skin is acne prone, this product made my skin break out more. I don't use this product anymore and it's still a full bottle. I  honestly enjoy their products but this one is a flop. I do not recommend this product and would prefer to use another product that contains Vitamin C.",4
"I purchased this product and was super excited to try it. In the past I had used some YSL skincare and been impressed.  I really like the idea of buying a refill cream. More environmentally friendly. Not buying another big bulky jar. I loved that when I read the ingredients fragrance was near the bottom of the list. I wanted something for dry skin. I also want help fighting signs of aging.  This cream caused burning, itchiness, redness, and welts.  So disappointing.",4
"I purchased this product based on the price point and expect it to be as good as NYX eyebrows product. Unfortunately, there was nothing show off when I swatch on my brows. I have black eyebrows, but I dye my hair blonde, so I really need a big transformation for my brows matching my hair. This product is not enough power to do that. I give this 2 stars still because I like the idea 3 in 1 brow pencil, but I would expect more results.",1
"I purchased this product based solely on the glowing reviews.  Lesson learned.  It did nothing for my under eye bags and dark circles, but always managed to find its way into my eyes.  I've tried several different types of eye creams in my 50 years, but this is the only one that, no matter how little I applied or how far from the corners, got into my eyes.  And it stings!  I'll just stick with Philosophy fragrances from now on and skip their skincare products.",3
"I purchased this product because I was looking for a new skin care regiment. I didnt really know what to get so it must have been my lucky day. I met Aasha who patiently went thru multiple products with me and explained the benefits and what would work best with my skin type. I walked out spending more than I had anticipated but without a single regret. I purchased the entire recommended regiment which consisted of the Rose  toner, eye cream and eye serum, moisturizer n the heavenly tatcha water cream and face serum and the caudalie elixir which I cant stop spraying to refresh throughout the day. Although Aasha took her time with me not one customer was slighted as they each were warmly greeted. She was able to handle the store all by herself. I've been shopping there for a long time and left many times frustrated due to the horrible service and non knowledgable staff. Sephora has a winner in Aasha, she really needs to train some of these other representatives across the Sephoras in customer service and product knowledge.",2
"I purchased this product just about a month ago and use it twice a day. It feels so nice going on, and has a real smooth finish. that's enough to keep me applying regularly. But I noticed now that the dark and sunken look under my eyes has diminished to a satisfying level. Well worth the purchase.",2
"I purchased this set because it came with free items, but definitely was not worth it because it did not come with a charger for the Luna 3. How am I supposed to use this without a charger? \nI called Sephora customer service and they said that it is not supposed to come with a charger.... What?!?!\nMost disappointing Sephora purchase to date. \nI will be returning this.",0
"I purchased this set mostly because I was in desperate need of a concealer brush and this set included 2! I was extremely surprised with the results of the foundation brush though. I normally used a brush that's more flat so I was skeptical about using a brush that was firm and much thicker. I find myself reaching for this brush daily, I just love the results. I realize brushes should be cleaned often, but this brush soaks up alot of foundation after it's cleaned (likely due to the volume of bristles), so I have to use a bit more product than I'd like to. Good makeup doesn't come cheap!! Because of that, I wash this brush once a week religiously and not a day more because the application becomes streaky and doesn't blend well at all.",4
I purchased this set myself and also requested as a Christmas gift. The value is fantastic and the product is amazing. I breakout with most stuff and used to have really blotchy dry skin on my cheeks. This has really helped my skin and I havent broken out from it. I will definitely be buying full sizes after.,4
I purchased this solely on the eye cream.  It seemed to make my dark circles worse.  The moisturizer was ok but probably suited more for oily skin as mine is dry.  The cleanser scrub was nice and the bag was cute and def. handy. You get a lot for $30 but not sure it's worth it since the eye cream made my eye area worse and I'm not asking for much!,1
I purchased this thinking the concept was interesting and the fact that people were raving about it. once I tried it on my face looked muddy (yes it is my shade). at first I assumed it was the way I applied it so I figured keep it and give it another go. I re-tried it and boy was I upset. one this thing is flippen MESSY to use! two it oxidizes and turns orange. three this thing gets extremely oily moves around patchy and my face literally looks like I ran outside with my 7 year old rubbed dirt all over my face and came inside. it does not last for more then a couple hours and at no point does this thing set without powder which I found confusing seeing as it is a liquid to powder formula. I have combo skin but boy did my skin look like a ball of grease which has not ever happened to me! \nhonestly not worth the buy,4
"I purchased this toner to help with dark spots and even skin tone.  From the many positive reviews, I was excited to see what this toner could do for my skin.  However, this toner caused terrible breakouts - which led to even more dark spots than I had before!! It also did nothing to lighten the dark spots I had prior to using it; and I used it for about 4 months (which should have been plenty of time to see results).  I’ve used other products containing glycolic acid, and this, by far, is the worst!",1
"I purchased this with high hopes, and it did not let me down. The tip is perfect for adjusting the thickness of line you wish to apply. It gave me perfection with my wing. I love it, and also applies so effortlessly.",2
"I purchased three out of the four glosses.  This one was very pretty.  It was subtle, but people noticed the glow on my lips.  I really thought the color looked great when I was testing it in Sephora.  I had to buy it because I love gold makeup.  I would definitely use this as an every day color, but then again, I would use any color.  Ha!  This color really is stunning on.",3
"I purchased Uncensored the day that it was released and absolutely loved the shade of red. The applicator shape is very unique and made it easy to apply the lipstick on my full lips. The color also lasted all day - I could apply the lipstick at 7am and, if I hadn't eaten anything messy or greasy, I would still have an even, albeit faint, coat of lipstick on at night. This said, the formula never completely dried down, so the lipstick was extremely prone to spreading all over my face and teeth if I was not too careful with it. The older the lipstick got, the more often this was a problem. Finally, about 9 or 10 months into owning the lipstick (and about halfway through the tube), it developed a very sour, off smell and I had to throw it out. I would not repurchase this product and will stick to matte liquid lipsticks that dry down completely!",0
I put it on every other night over my serum and moisturizer and wash it off in the morning.  I used to have a lot of little bumps on my face and over the last 2 1/2 weeks they are almost all gone.  I'm beyond happy and will continue to buy it for that reason alone!!!!!,4
I put it on my face in the winter when my skin was super dry. It stung my skin so bad. I was hoping it would be calming and soothing. I've used this mask before when my skin wasn't as dry and felt it didn't hydrate my skin enough to notice any difference. Pretty dissapointed in the face mask.,1
I put off buying this for the longest time because the colors look so dark in the picture. Even after my first application it was perfect. Every other contour I’ve tried looks like I have dirt on my face. This made my face look slimmer. The bronzer acted as a blush for me. The highlighter is well pigmented but not glittery. I like the brush too and it’s perfect for traveling. I’m so glad I bought this.,3
I ran out of my usual night cream and decided to buy Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Night Cream instead. I hated it. My skin felt sticky and I ended up washing it off during the night when I noticed blemishes starting to form.  This is not as nice as many of the other FRESH products that I use daily.,3
I rarely rate a product five stars. I think these shadows are unreal abd super creamy and foiled. The mattes are so soft and blendable. I honestly feel these original 28 pan shadows has better quality compare to those she came out later (dont get me wrong，newer ones are awesome too，just 28 is even better. Despite from the high price tag，these ND shadow palettes are my absolute favorites and recommendations.,4
"I rarely write reviews, but I spent so much time reading other reviews looking for a black eye pencil that would stay in place, I felt I had to share. This one got really good reviews. What? I put it on, answered an email (about 15 minutes), checked the mirror before I left the house, and I already looked like a raccoon. It wasn't even 15 minutes before it completely bled to my under-eye. It may be the very worst pencil among the thousands I have tried. Back it goes...",3
"I rarely write reviews, but this product is one of the few that has been a constant in my beauty routine for several years now. I'm always trying new products (any other mascara obsessives out there?), but I always come back to this.\n\nHere's what I like...\n\nFlaking - Yes, there is some. However, I find the flakes to be far smaller than other mascaras (almost too small to be noticed), and when I clean them up, they don't smear.\n\nSmall Brush - For someone who has very deep-set eyes, I find smaller brushes like this one help me get in the outer creases more easily without accidentally touching the brush to my lids.\n\nIt lifts! - So in the product description, it doesn't mention anything about lifting the lashes. However, as someone who typically uses an eyelash curler to boost my very straight lashes, I find that with this mascara, I don't need to do that - it lifts my lashes upon application, and I appreciate being able to skip the curling step (but sometimes I do it anyway just because~).\n\nLess Clumping - My eyelashes have a habit of criss-crossing each other. Even with this mascara, which claims to keep lashes ""separated and defined,"" I still have a bit of clumping, but it's far better at preventing clumping than others I've tried.\n\nEveryone has their own preferences/needs in regards to mascaras, but I would recommend this to ANYONE, with any type of lashes, to try at least once.",0
"I rarely write reviews of anything on any site, but have been meaning to write this one for months now. First tried this as a Sephora sample, and when I did I had to go back and look it up. My eyes are ridiculously, frustratingly sensitive; I'd given up wearing mascara because every brand I tried left them burning, teary, and irritated. Not this one.\nIt does smudge a bit, like any mascara will do. It isn't ""doll-like lashes"" or going to make people think you're wearing falsies. \nWhat it does do it make pale lashes show up, it defines them and separates them without clumping, and IT DOESN'T IRRITATE YOUR (OR AT LEAST MY) EYES. Too Face has a loyal customer in me as long as they keep making this.",3
I read about the serum in magazines so I wanted to try it. The serum is not sticky at all and absorbs in my skin evenly. I apply this after my skin toner. It doesn't irritate my skin (I have combination skin and rosacea). The serum is not scented so it's another plus in my book.,1
"I read all the negative reviews and was very worried about ordering this eyeliner, but I got another 20% off so I ordered 2 of them in matte black. I had no problem with mine. I think it holds enough product on the tip just fine! I would say it's easy to remove and it stays put! I love doing a cat eye everyday. and this felt point was amazing and very easy to work with. I'm so glad I bought 2 of them personally. thinking about buying more colors now.",2
"I read a lot of mixed reviews but I tried it in store and later on ordered it online. the smell is amazing, coconut, and it give that dewy finish. No where does it say this give you a shimmery finish as there is no glitte\nr in the product which seemed to be where a lot of dispute came from. overall it lasted well, smells fantastic and I love the dewy look. Everyone has different skin and different ideals about how a product should work, however what works for one person will not work for another.",4
I read so many good reviews and had high hope's for this product. I just really didn't like it which is disappointing considering the price. I have normal to dry skin and it highlighted every imperfection on my face and slid around. I tried different applications and primers and it just didn't work. I'm sorry to say I don't recommend.,4
"I read some other reviews to see if anyone else was having similar issues and discovered that they are. The swatches look nice and wearable but when I put these on my lips, the shades look so off. They appear to be too light and I bought 3 of them. I included photos of She's Secure (left) and She's Confident (right) so you can see. On the lips, the shades look very light and beige. They also look so similar I would've been better off just buying one.\n\nThis product overall was very unflattering for me in terms of shade.",0
"I read that this gives such shine and great pigment that i went against my better judgment and bought ""just one more,"" highlighter.   I must own a 100 different powder high lighters and i Am always looking for the next best thing.\n\nSo far on my aging skin amrezy and dior  high lighters have worked the best for my specific skin and it's very unlikely highlighter can top their performance. \n\n It turns out this is just like 75% of all the other high lighters that I own. Good enough but not great. Nothing different and nothing special. More of the same.  I wish I had skipped this and put the money towards skin care products.",3
"I read the amazing reviews about this product and decided to try it for my dark circles, despite being super skeptical about it working as well as everyone said it did... It doesn't work. I think it's cute that people who don't actually have dark circles rave about how great this stuff is. After the first use the skin around my eyelids started peeling even though I use retinol already, so I gave it a couple of days and then tried it again and the same thing happened. First off, this product shouldn't be packaged in a jar or a see through container considering it contains retinol. The second thing I really didn't like was the texture, which absorbs into the skin so quickly it doesn't actually feel hydrating at all. I returned the product and would not repurchase. Thumbs down.",4
I read the reviews and was so moved I purchased this product. It has been the best thing I have ever done for my aging skin. My face hasn't looked so fresh and felt so smooth in years! It is also brighter and I swear firmer with less fine lines! My makeup goes on better too. I love this product and will be using this for a very long time. Thank you Peter Thomas Roth!,4
I really can only get behind about half the colors in this pallette. The dark blue glitter which I was so excited about looked terrible on the eyes and pulled grey. The green was sheer and patchy. I use now only for the yellow and a couple of the neutrals and even then they don't wow me. Save your money!,4
"I really can't say enough good things about this duo. They're both absolutely stunning and high quality. Application is unproblematic and chipping is minimal, even though I'm very hard on my hands. Love!",2
"I really can't tell if this does anything, but I'm going to keep using it. I didn't originally have any outstanding eye issues, other than very slight dark circles prior to using this. And they MAY be better than they were before, but I didn't take a picture so I don't have a good reference.\n\nOther than that, I use it nightly, and have been for 4 months now, and have only used half of the product. So for the price tag, honestly it's definitely a bargain. I will probably repurchase it knowing it's probably going to eventually make a difference in my slight dark circles (or maybe as a preventative?).\n\nI still definitely recommend it.",1
"I really can't tell this apart from the Better than Sex mascara also by Two Faced, but if I had to guess I would say that the BTS formula is a bit thicker and darker.  This DG version looks great too, but it seems like I have to put several coats on to get the same result.",3
"I really do love this moisturizer. I first had it as a mini sample but had another favorite moisturizer at the time. When my favorite one for discontinued I bought this in full size. Well, I love the way it feels on my face, and a little goes a long way! My only hesitation in repurchasing is I think it's making me break out when using it daily. I have super sensitive skin (literally almost anything will make me break out).... :(",0
"I really don't get the draw of this product. Yes, coconut oil is a great product. I got a sample of this and it works the exact same as my organic virgin coconut oil from Walmart. It's literally just coconut oil. No other ingredients. Overpriced nonsense.",2
"I really don't have anything bad to say about these. I have only ever swatched this formula and thought I hated it. So glad I gave this a go anyway!\nThis is the first nude I've ever use that looked good on me without a liner. The formula feel like a matte and a creme. It's really thick... but not in a bad way. I can't rub my lips together when I'm wearing it, and to press them instead. But the color lasts a long time and fades well.\nAs for the components, they perform perfectly in the kit I got. It's a little confusing at first because you basically have to swap the colors between two different components. But with patience (and the directions) it's not too difficult to figure out.",4
"I really enjoyed this highlighter. I found that it looked very natural with foundation for a soft glow. It has a really great color for eyes as well. I liked the texture a lot, and it blends great! I got to try it through influenster.",3
"I really enjoyed this lip balm while I had it. No weird taste or smells, leaves my lips soft and I adore the magnetic packaging. Unfortunately it is a very soft formula so I used it up pretty fast. Would like to buy one of the tinted ones in the future once I get through some other balms I have or want to try",4
I really enjoyed this lipstick. The color is long lasting and pairs well with just about any lip liner. The only thing I didn't like was the packaging. It was just a pain to get the product out the packaging and also my lipstick fell out the holder.... Aside from that I loved it!!,4
"I really enjoyed using this eye cream. I LOVE the packaging. I think it is beautiful and high quality. The product has no scent which is fine for me! It’s thick and decadent and is absorbed so well! It makes my skin feel soft and supple around my eyes. It also helped my dark circles that I’ve suffered with my whole life. They are not 100% removed,\n\xa0but they look a lot better! I also like that this is anti-aging. I have been using this in my night routine. I received this product for testing purposes, however my review is based on my honest opinion.",1
"I really enjoy the consistency of this serum. In general, skincare with a creamy consistency melts into my skin better than oil or liquid kinds. I haven't used it enough to notice tightening, but it feels great on my skin and makes my skin feel soft all day. I removed 1 star for the odor - it isn't awful but definitely not pleasant. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1
"I really enjoy the ingredients and all of the live strains (the added prebiotic is another plus!) I've been taking these for only a few weeks, and I have noticed my stomach issues lessening. I personally stugle with digestion issues (slower digestion from POTS plus IBS) and so a product like this is a big help. I did have a bit of a bloating adjust period, but it seems to have been worth it. While I do not suffer from acne (just the occasional blemish), I have noticed that my skin has been a bit better and I've had minimal breakouts. I'm excited to continue this product if I can afford it. My biggest and only issue is the price. At $40 a month (on top of my other supplements I take as prescribed by my doctor) it's pretty costly. I hope I can keep taking them, but I may just have to find the more inexpensive alternative. I received this complimentary for testing purposes.",0
I really enjoy this eye cream.  It is nourishing and not heavy at all.  I used this eye cream for about two years and my eyes have been moisturized and it has not been dried out even during cold weathers.  It is expensive but I do think it is worth it.  My husband also uses this eye cream and he said his eyes seems younger (I think what he meant to say is moisturized).,1
"I really enjoy this face oil! I use it twice a day after exfoliating, morning and night. I feel like my skin has a fresh and healthy look to it, with no build-up. I've just ordered it again to continue using.",4
"I really enjoy this lip mask line. For this purchase, I was slightly disappointed the full size berry did not come with a spatula. Otherwise, everything was great! I love all the scents and waking up with soft lips.",4
"I really enjoy this palette. I haven't run into any of the problems with tons of fall out like others have said, however it is not quite as good as my other tarte palettes. I'm not one to care for packaging so long as there is some, the sequins are pretty but they won't last, however the outer container itself will. if you're looking for something fun and pretty this works but not as high quality as we're used to from tarte.",2
I really enjoy this primer. It has a nice texture that makes my skin feel smoother. It made my makeup collection better. I'm a head sweater so I don't think it helped me personally with limiting my oily areas from getting slick.,0
I really enjoy this product. it moisturizes pretty well as long as you continuously apply so I wear it all the time when I'm not wearing lip stains. it's definitely saved my dried out lips within 2 days! I love that it's small and eye catchy.,4
"I really enjoy this serum. The ingredients are high quality and seem to deliver on their promises! For context, I am in my late 30s and have fair, oily skin. I'm prone to acne, large pores and have occasional bouts of skin sensitivity, redness and eczema. The serum starts as a lotion consistency and then turns into a liquid as you rub it into the skin. It absorbs quickly into the skin although that can also limit how spreadable it is. I have been using 2 pumps with every application. There's also an interesting ""tart"" scent to it. Not unpleasant or especially strong but it is evident so if you're sensitive to smells, you might not enjoy that aspect. After immediate application, you can see a visible glow to the skin. I also top this with a moisturizer as I feel it can be a touch drying without one. After a few weeks of use, I can safely say that I've noticed improvements in the texture and tone of my skin, specifically on my cheeks. The redness has subsided and the texture appears to be smoother. I'm not sure it has as dramatic an effect as I expected it might but I also recognize that it takes months to see any long term results from skincare regimens. I waited a few weeks before reviewing this because I wanted to be sure that I was giving it a fair and accurate assessment beyond just a first impression. I would have to revisit it in another couple months to really see the long term effects of it, however. I recieved this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  All thoughts and opinions are my own.",4
"I really enjoy using the Lancer Soothe and Hydrate Serum with Hyaluronic Acid.  All I can say is that it makes my face feel good.  I have noticed a better skin tone, less redness, and as I said before my face just feels good and soothed.  Sometimes my skin can be a little sensitive, but this product doesn't bother me at all.  I use it at night after showering.",1
"I really enjoy using this. I bought it in store as my ""2nd option if I couldn't find the one I wanted"". I was a bit nervous to try it because of all the negative reviews but this is really nice! its light (almost like mousse feel) has not clumped and stayed on my curled lashes very well. I find it more of a casual look but when all else fails sephora saves the day!",1
"I really enjoy using this oil. I purchased the oil because I have oily skin so I have to be very particular about what type of oils I use. The key isn't avoiding oil altogether, it's about just making sure you choose one that helps to balance your pH and does not clog pores. Rose hip seed oil is perfect for oily skin. It absorbs into the skin quickly and has a silky texture. I don't wear this over makeup. You just can't do that if you have oily skin. I use it as part of my night skincare routine just to keep my skin moisturized and healthy. If you have oily skin and you decide to avoid using oil your skin will simply produce more oil as a response because it will interpret that as if you need it. So I use oil-free makeup products and matte products. However, I'm sure to make oil apart of my night time skincare routine and this is the right one.",2
"I really hate to put a bad review about this because I try to support cruelty free brands. However, I'm also not wasting money. I tried it a few times and it just didn't impress me so I sent it back. It didn't feel moisturizing enough. I'll stick with Bite Beauty's lip mask. I give 2 stars for being cruelty free.",3
"I really have been enjoying this product! I've been adding a drop to my daily moisturizer in the morning, and it has given a nice, subtle glow that is not too bronzy or ""obvious""! I've actually just been wearing this mixed with my daily moisturizer, and mascara!",4
"I really liked the color story with this palette, and the glitter shades really drew me in, until I swatched it. Even with a light touch, so much glitter kicked up in the pan and flew everywhere, it was a dealbreaker for me.",4
"I really liked the eyeliner and the powder as I tried the Birthday Gift minies this year. Was thinking to purchase full size eyeliner as it is the best one I used, it's so precise and easy to apply. The powder looks and feels very nice. When I saw this set I fell in love with lipsticks colors. Nude pinkish and red perfectly suits me. On top of that you get the clutch. I am very satisfied with the purchase.",1
I really liked these pads and noticed that my hyperpigmentation was lightening and my overall complexion was brighter after using them everyday. I decided to buy a liquid toner instead of these pads after sampling them though because if you use these pads twice a day then they would only last you a month. I got REN's AHA skin tonic for $45 and that large bottle will last me a while. I would highly recommend it if you're interested!,0
"I really liked this eye cream! I had been looking for something that I could safely use close to my eyes since I get dry patches on my upper and lower lids. Since this is fragrance free and labeled as safe for sensitive eyes, I gave it a whirl. It hydrated the skin but didn't leave it feeling too tacky (which made it look pretty smooth under makeup), and I did notice it diminishing some of the finer lines and shadows around my eyes. Pretty pricey, but it lasted me the better part of a year!",4
"I really liked this foundation. I have oily skin and this didn't seem to affect the finish so that was a plus! The little reservoir that the product come out on is an interesting feature. The one downside is that it doesn't seem to have many options for darker skin, so while I was able to find my perfect shade, those with a deeper complexion might not be able to find their match. I definitely enjoyed this product and I was glad to receive this as a free sample through Influenster.",4
"I really liked this product at first until I discovered other concealers that are better. The consistency is too thick, so it doesn't blend well no matter what technique you use. It does do a pretty good job of covering discoloration, but not acne that has any type of scab or raised skin.",4
"I really like how this primer goes on smoothly and helps my concealer stay put all day!  It seems to add a subtle glow to my skin.  I’ve used other brands of primers before, but not this one.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily, but this primer did not bother my skin at all, which I love!  I recommend this primer and will definitely buy again!",1
"I really like it. I have oily skin and can wear it without a primer, which I like because most primers give me acne. I wore it for a 10 hour day and it stayed on nicely. I love the brush it comes with and only need a light veil to cover everything. I apply lightly, as I can see how a heavy application would look to heavy.",2
"I really like that a facewash, I'm pregnant and my skin is a mess this helped me keep my acne under control and made my skin look healthy and younger. My only complaint is that it is a little drying, so make sure to use a good moisturizer.",4
I really like the clearing mask and gravity mask they have so wanted to try this. I like that they offer a small one to try. Still you do get a lot of product.  I don't have any skin discolorations but feel i get dull sometimes and do have some pores. I really like the smell of this and it does make my skin look brighter and more helps with texture. It's fast  easy to get off.  I would consider getting the full size one.,2
"I really like the concealer/foundation in this line. 11.5 is strongly peach, similar to Bobbi Brown's corrector, which was my go-to for years. This foundation is exactly that color and it's a far cry from neutral undertones. I tried to apply it sheerly with moisture mist, brush, fingers, sponge, you name it, but it's too much coverage for me, and the finish was soft matte, and I'm not dry, more combination. It pooled in my pores and the attempt to sheer it out did not work. I looked bright peach, so it simply was not right for me.",4
I really like the idea but unfortunately this broke me out right away. I received this as a free sample and the sample did not include the roller part so I didn't really get to fully experience the product. I used it with my Jade roller though and did like it. I was surprised that it broke me out because I do not break out easy.  if it did not I would have probably enjoyed it.,2
"I really like the idea of these soaps bars. Combating plastic waste is forward thinking for the beauty industry. They are good quality, don't dry out my face. It's nice you can order the travel duo to see if it's worth it without paying full price for the regular size. They're definitely worth it. Highly recommend.",1
"I really like the original Kush Mascara formula, but this isn't waterproof at all! It smears, smudges, and streaks. It is also much, much thinner than the regular formula. So it does nothing to make my lashes look thick and full. Very disappointed in this!",1
I really like the texture and brush of this mascara! It's not too thick or clumpy. It goes on very smooth and separates my lashes. It's a good choice for a natural look. I received this for free through influenster.,3
"I really like the tint shade of this tinted gloss, but sadly it doesn't stick around very long. I'm also not terribly impressed with the gloss' moisturizing properties, since my lips have cracked and split after each wear so far. I admit that most balms and lipsticks are problematic for my contact dermatitis, but I had high hopes for this one since I absolutely adore the Kosas oil foundation. I won't be buying this again.",2
"I REALLY like the wand on this mascara - it gives the product a smooth, no-clump application and gives your lashes a big boost. I prefer waterproof products (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but this product definitely delivers the bang for your buck.",2
"I really like this 10% lactic acid peel, especially right now. Because I'm having some acne flair ups and am out of my retinoid. You can easily dilute this with other water based products if needed. It also has purified Tasmanian Pepperberry, to reduce signs of inflammation and sensitivity often associated with exfoliation. I personally use this several evenings out of the week. I use the TO hyalaronic acid immediately following a hydrating toner (like while my face is still wet,) then i spot treat with salicylic acid and let that dry, THEN i apply this Lactic Acid Peel. I wake up with glowing skin, so i'm going to continue to use it. And did i mention it has lasted me 8 months with regular use and i still have a bunch left?! I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone, especially yall ballin on a budget. This is cheap, but works sooo well!! Hey, Sephora Play, i need your help with my acne! Can you please send me the Sunday Riley Retinoid Serum, Glow Recipe Watermelon Sleep Mask, and/or anything from the brand Fresh, such as the Fresh Kombucha Essence or Fresh face masks. I'm super into skincare right now. I want 'Glass Skin' for summer!",1
"I really like this brow gel. It stays on even through my gym work outs. I had no issues applying it but I do recommend starting with a light hand. To be honest, my only issue was which shade works best (still deciding). 4 different Sephora reps had different color recommendations (not helpful).  I normally wear benefit brow products in # 4.",2
"I really like this eye cream. It has a nice hydrating effect to it and smells good. It does a good job at leaving my under eye area feeling silky, smooth and moisturized without leaving a greasy feel. My only con is the texture in the jar is a bit thick and putty like, which makes it difficult for me to apply is gently.\n\n***I recieved a full-size jar of this product from Influenster to try and give my HONEST and TRUTHFUL opinion and review.***",0
"I really like this eyeliner. I love the brush tip of the KVD tattoo liner, but I hate the price and how fast it dries out. I switched to this liner and I mostly love it. At first, it would smear a little during my long days at work, but then I started using an eyeshadow primer and now it doesn't budge. I love the brush shape, and I can make a really nice crisp line and perfect wing with it. My only issue is this: after using the liner for a couple months, the brush tip starts to kind of fall apart, which can cause me to make mistakes more often. This happened with both liners I purchased. This would be an absolutely perfect liner if Sephora would just update it to have a more high quality brush, like the KVD liner.",0
"I really like this eye pencil, it's a great multi use pencil. you can use both sides or just one. perfect for someone always on the go and great to travel with. I love the pigment of this, it really makes your brows stand out.",1
"I really like this for my body acne because the spray nozzle works even if its upside down. I dont get too much anymore, but it great for ""bacne"" and ...butt pimples. I bought this initially because I saw the review where someone said this worked/helped with KP and it absolutely does! However, i do think there are cheaper body moisturizers that contain salicylic acid that are more effective. For the price, i wouldnt recommend it for KP because you will run out very quickly. But for just spritzing on your back or booty when you are having flare ups, its great and really helps reduce the inflamation. Nice cooling sensation too.",0
"I really like this foundation, I got as sample from Sephora online. I have dry skin, the texture is liquid but not very liquidy, more creamy which I like so much. it gives me natural dewy finish and yes it is long lasting. covers my lines beautifully, well I am in my mid 30. I am very impressed with the result! I am a shapetape foundation freaks and I also love this one! \nI am  NC15 MAC , 2 Smashbox studio skin, light  sand Tarte shape tape. definitely will buy again!",2
"I really like this foundation. It's high coverage and it fits my skintone perfectly. I use it when I dont have time for foundation,  but want to cover my hyperpigmentation a bit. Sometimes I use it with a color correcting concealer.  It lasts all day and doesnt crease. It's a bit dark for my under eyes so idk if it would work to conceal dark circles. But I think it's perfect for the no makeup look. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1
"I really like this handcream.  I wash my hands a lot, so I can easily get dry cuticles and cracked fingers.  This cream provide a nice smooth and lightweight coating that leaves my hands soft and moisturized.  It's not sticky at all, and I've even uses it on my elbows and feet.",2
"I really like this! I have somewhat dry skin and I don't feel like this gets super oily quickly. However, powdering the t-zone is most likely a must. You can really create a light to medium coverage (I use it all over, not as a concealer). I also don't find that it breaks me out or anything and I'm sensitive to pure coconut oil on the skin. This is not the same! I know it's a small pot and I don't use it everyday but I feel like it's not overpriced for what you get.",2
"I really like this kit. The primer goes on smoothly and I do feel like it helps my redness. The fact that the powder comes with a locking lid makes this worth the 5 stars alone, but I find it very mattifying with great coverage. I wear it over my Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation and it lasts allll day!",4
I really like this pencil in black and I think it's very pigmented and last a long time. my only issues is it's so creamy it breaks off a little but my eyes appreciate it since there is less tugging. sharoping it so often is annoying though but nbd,1
I really like this powder. It's very smooth and gives a nice velvet touch after setting. I usually have to retouch my makeup throughout the day when I'm oily but I never had to retouch and I had wore makeup for about 12 hours.,0
I really like this primer this is my fourth bottle but this is the first time I have tried this eye cream .I must say I have never seen instant results from an eye cream even my husband agreed my bags were almost completely gone.I have migraines and you can normally see my eye is really puffy can't wait to see if this will make a difference. I will definitely add this to my list of favorites!,3
I really like this product for my combination skin. Witch hazel and salicylic acid is an added bonus. It is doing a great job on controlling shine and oil. It is a great addition to my makeup routine now.,1
"I really like this product! I don't usually use primers anymore but after trying this out, I noticed my skin had lesser pores peeking through my foundation, especially on my nose and cheek area. It also mattified my skin as soon as it set but it's not drying, and it does have a herbally smell I will say. I think it has to do with the charcoal. Overall it made my makeup look smooth and poreless in the areas I focused it on and lasted pretty much almost all day!",0
"I really like this product. It has a beautiful consistency and leaves me skin looking glowy and feeling fresh. So far, the product has not broken up on my trouble areas (nose, chin) like other foundations I've tried. I prefer brush application as it creates more coverage, but even if you layer it on, it feels light.",4
"I really like this product. It's natural and clean. It feels nice on the skin, I have combination skin (mostly oily with patches of dry) this cream moisturizes my dry spots and doesn't make me feel gross on my oily spots. Thanks to influenster for sending me this!",4
"I really like this product. The smell is great and the spray doesn't make my makeup look chunky like some other setting sprays, however when I spray it, it foams at the top and doesn't spray like a fine mist. I feel like a lot of product gets wasted from the foaming out of the nozzle.",0
"I really like this setting spray, but I also own a drugstore setting spray that does just as well. If you're up for spending the money, this is definitely the one you should buy, but if not, there's cheaper ones that work just as well. I always wear matte foundation as I have oily skin and this spray helps keep my makeup on and looking nice for at least 8-10 hours without it turning powdery. However, I wouldn't say it lasts 16 hours as it claims. Good spray, nothing super special though.",4
"I really loved this pink gloss from Marc Jacobs.  I thought it was going to be a bit bright, but it really looked nice.  The texture was not sticky.  I even used it as a topper over another lipstick and it looked great. i would definitely repurchase.",3
"I really loved this,  the primer is smooth and the purple glow is luminescent.  The setting powder is my favorite,  it feels very hydrating and leaves a beautiful finish.  The champagne pop is just so pretty. This was absolutely perfect to sample so now I can decide if I want to purchase the full size. I totally will.",2
I really love Pillow Lips High Pigment Moisture Wrapping Lipstick  (Stellar). It goes on very smoothly and give a vibrant pop of color to my lips. The color Stellar is a gorgeous shade of red. It was perfect for the Christmas season. I will definitely buy this lipstick in other colors as well!,3
I really love the colors and they blend very well but it creases on me after of 8 hours of wearing it to work. I used it with my favorite too faced shadow insurance and the ABH primer and both creased. does anyone have suggestions.,1
"I really love the concept, and the fact that you can create a whole lot of looks! But, I think it doesn't stay that long on the lips, even with a primer on! I tried with a gloss over and with translucid powder for a matte look too, it stays on a little bit better! But I dont recommend to let it bare. And its really big and clumsy, don't think about taking it with you for retouches! Also, I find it very drying on the lips. Overall, I like it, but wouldn't by it again!",0
"I really love the lip mask and the nighttime treatment, they are both incredibly hydrating. the daytime balm is a good formula, however, this small size is very difficult to use because any slight pressure and the stick tips over and feels like it will break at the base. I would recommend for the mask and nighttime treatment alone.",0
I really love these brushes. I have hooded eyes and the detail brush works really well for me. the brushes are very soft and above average in terms of quality for synthetic brushes in my opinion. Got these while I think about investing in Japanese brushes.,3
"I really love these colors, and they smell great. My only issue with this palette is that it's got a lot of glitter and that makes it unwearable for me during the day. I've tried using the colors as eyeshadow but they are still too glittery for me.",2
I really love the shine and this gloss is very moisturizing! The smell is very light and pleasant. \nI did have a devil of a time getting it started but then I remembered on a review I read if you roll it one direction repeatedly it will start up. I did that and it works great! \nI'm getting 2 of the rose quartz next order for my daughters!,3
"I really love this brush cleaner. I go out of my way to work to pick up two or three or four bottles, however many they have, to stock up on a regular basis.  None of us like washing our brushes, and I’m not going to say that this cleanser does the same kind of thorough  job, but it comes really close.",2
"I REALLY love this cleanser, it makes my skin feel very smooth and glowy! This will be a permanent part of my skincare routine BUT the bottle is AWFUL! Your products are wonderful, but this bottle has got to go. When my hands are wet holding this bottle is not easy to do. I've dropped it too many times to count.",0
"I really love this eye cream, it makes my skin brighter and hydrated. The only downside is that my eyes sting when I put it. I thought it would be more gentle on the eyes as it's an eye crème. I have to be more careful, and apart from that I really like the effect it has on my eyes skin.",1
I really love this eye cream. you can use this day and night ..the formula is amazing. I like an eye cream that's not too thick when it comes to makeup application. This feels so light and airy but gives excellent moisturizing benefits and melts right in to your under eye area.. I've seen some say that they do not care for the packaging but I actually like it!!,1
I really love this foundation. It gives you great light to medium coverage and it stays on all day without looking cakey. It makes my skin look healthy and slightly dewy without being greasy and it doesn't get in my pores and give me the polka dot look. Really happy with it!,3
"I really love this highlighter, it's very subtle and with being fair skinned it's very pretty on my 56-year old skin.  In the past, all highlighters made me look like the Tin Man.  I haven't tried to wear one in years, but this one caught my eye and I'm in love.",3
"I really love this Lipstick. It's immensely moisturizing and has a gorgeous shimmery purple hue to it. This may vary based on application and lip pH, however I didn't notice much of a difference in the shades. Even so, it's a great lipstick and feels amazing on your lips. Totally worth the price.",4
I really love this mascara. I have allergies that effect my eyes causing them to be very itchy. Products that flake or stiffen too. Much make them worse. This product does not flake or cause further irritation. The brush separates my lashes really well too.,4
"I really love this product, especially the powder side. It is so so so forgiving and helps create a soft full brow look which is perfect for days when I'm too lazy to wear contacts and don't want my brows to be too strong when I have my glasses on. I do also enjoy the wax pencil part, it is easy to draw with, but I think the star of the show is the powder. I'm sad that Benefit does not yet offer the powder as a separate product by itself, but I'll remain hopeful!",1
I really love this product. I'm 47 with combo skin. I have no skin issues really but I'm still super fussy about face creams. this checks every box for me. it is super hydrating where I need it. my skin is left bouncy and smooth. greatest of all is that it doesn't leave my skin sticky. I despise creams that act like magnets for every stray hair that floats by. (if you have a dog in your bed you understand),3
"I really love this serum, from the first day.  My skin felt instantly hydrated skin tone seemed to even out and some fine lines seem less noticeable.  I love the easy to use pump and how it feels when applying it, just the right amount, it goes a long way.",3
I Really Love This Serum It Gives You Great Moisture With A Beautiful Glow I Love The Way It Makes My Skin Look Brighter And Healthier Even My Family And Friends Noticed A Difference Thank You Summer Fridays ❣,0
"I really love this set. The Luna three is soft and gentle on my face. I love the mermaid skin moisturizer. It goes on well, and I feel like I can put my make up over it, without looking greasy. A must buy,",0
"I really love this stuff! I find it best to use a brush to apply because if you use your fingers, the color seems to just transfer to your fingers and it stains!  However, it stays on my face all day long!",0
"I really love this stuff! I've used it for a couple years now mainly as a quick cleanser after being really active or to take off makeup and would wash my face afterwards. But currently being 9mos pregnant and having a hard time bending over the sink to use my fashwash. I've been using this as a stand alone at night. it has really been holding it's own! and as an acne prone adult, I'm glad to say it has been doing a great job!",4
"I really love this! with this set of brushes, I feel like I can create any kind of eye look. each brush has really unique tapering and shapes I haven't seen in other brushes. they blend nicely and are super soft! and to top it off this bag is the perfect size to put together all my favorite makeup products on the go in if I was traveling. super beautiful bag and brushes.",1
"I really love urban decay palettes, I have all the others. I noticed with this one the colors don't have staying power that the others do.  When I come home from work the colors have come off during the day. Wish it had more staying power.",1
"I really, really love this concealer!!!! At first, I thought I might not like it based purely on the applicator.  That old adage of, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" can certainly be applied here. The paddle here is unlike most on the market, in that the ends are flattened instead of rounded out. This effect allows the user to be able to apply less product, while still giving you more coverage. The formula is creamy, but it does not budge once it has been set, and it does not crease even though it IS creamy. It keeps all my undereye secrets for me.  This is by far one of the best concealers I have ever tried. I really, truly love it so much that I have sang it praises to several of my friends already telling them that they needed this concealer in their life. I received this product from influenster complimentary for review purposes.\nPro Tip: With this concealer, less is actually better. This concealer is very creamy that is glides on effortlessly, so a little goes a long way, just don't forget to set it.",2
"I really really wanted to love this palette. When I first saw the color story and the packaging, I was sold. When I opened up the palette, my breath was taken away. Everything about this palette is visually stunning.... but application was a whole different ball game. The fall out from the shadows is terrible, the blendability gets a huge thumbs down. The texture of the eyeshadows are just a complete miss, very chalks and I had to build up color to the point where my eyelids looked like they had wrinkles. I would pass on this one despite how beautiful it looks.",1
"I really regret buying this. the reviews are so good and I have a lip balm addiction. I have tried so many lip balms from so many brands to say that this is worse than just buying a drugstore lip balm. It's not creamy at all. once you apply it, it melts on the lips in a bad way because it turns in a kind of oil that will not absorb on your lips. Feels like you put cooking oil on the lips. really bad. If you apply it at night. you wake up with zero product on and very dry chapped lips. this is really not good. wondering where those reviews come from.",0
"I really struggle to find a lipstick that doesnt look crusty on my ultra dry lips. With that being said, this lipstick is amazing! It's so moisturizing and feels great on my lips and it layers well over chapstick. The color is great and the staying power is insane! It's not matte so I didn't expect it to last as long as it did but I only had to reapply once throught the day. The packaging is stunning and has good weight to it and such a luxe feel. It has a light rose scent that's not too overpowering and is quite pleasent. Overall, such a great product!",4
I really think these are working for me. It's a very subtle effect but do feel it helps me to focus and not to get as wound up as fast or as often as i do in some situations.  My biggest gripe is the quantity offered and the price. I wish they would at least offer a 60 quantity bottle. i feel I'm going through them faster then i can buy them.,2
"I REALLY wanted the Benefiance Night cream, but I was told that they dont make it anymore. So I bought the day cream. It is ok, but it doesnt treat my dry skin as well. It tastes terrible on my lips, and when it gets in my eyes it stings.  I hope Shiseido decides to make the night cream again.",3
"I really wanted this work. I loved the smell, it wasn't strong. I have dry since so that's why I bought this, now it is very moisturizing that part I absolutely loved. The only downside is it didn't really help cover up my pores. So if have dry skin but don't have large pores definitely give this a try.",4
"I really wanted to like this, but it made my sensitive, combination skin look worst. I get really dry and red on my cheeks, around my chin and jaw area. I was excited to use this since it claims to hydrate dry skin. However, after applying this I had flaky, dry patches and it made me breakout.",1
"I really wanted to like this concealer, but it oxidized on me every single time. I purchased it on 4 different occasions, and unfortunately always ended up returning it. The oxidation is consistent with 40NY and 30NY. They turned dark orange within 5 minutes. The concealer though is very long lasting and waterproof/transferproof.",1
"I really wanted to like this foundation as it gave me the right amount of coverage, but on me it doesn't last!! I've tried primers, setting powder, setting spray.  Within a few hours I can see my makeup looking dull.  Didn't work for me.",4
"I really wanted to like this little cleanser. I have cystic and nodulic acne prone skin, and I tend to get dry patches and break out if I use medicated cleansers. I try a lot of mini sized ""all skin types"" products because of this. This cleanser smelled great, felt nice on the skin and did initially calm some of my redness. Sadly, after about a week, it started breaking me out like crazy. As soon as I stopped using it, my skin cleared up.",1
"I really wanted to like this set. It is so cute. The problem is that all of the colors were extremely sheer and some, just too glittery. My unicorn loving 12 year old self would have loved this many years ago. I returned it. if this is for someone who is in their teens, they will love it!",2
I really wanted to live this but I can't get over the fact it uses PET glitter (microplastic) even though it also has synthetic flourophogite? I have a friend who scratched their cornea after getting a piece of plastic glitter in their eye. I don't think so! milk you can do so much better.,1
"I really wanted to love this as I got it as a sample and love the feel of it as you apply on your skin. BUT....it actually dries out my skin and doesn't leave a good after feel, my skin feels pretty raw and tight. It doesn't work for me for morning or night care, primer and foundation doesn't apply well over it.",4
"I really wanted to love this because I heard great things and it looked really good in pictures, but it just won’t stay on me. I have dry and dehydrated cheeks and this just disappears within a couple hours. I’ve tried it with different primers and on bare face but it’s all the same. The colour and finish are lovely and natural, but, for the price, considering the longevity it’s really not worth it. Speaking of the hefty price tag, the lilah b. on the top lid was already half erased after a few uses with cleans hands which is really ridiculous at this price. I know it works great for some, but maybe not if your skin type is on the drier side.",0
I really wanted to love this but it's just way too sheer and expensive for me to want to purchase again. The color is barely a pink tint with some shimmer. This might be fine for those with already pigmented lips but I was hoping for something to add a bit more color than a normal lip balm.,0
"I really wanted to love this foundation especially because of that price point! I used it for about a week straight and kept having the same issues. It has such a nice texture, but that's about it. This doesn't do anything for my pores and it's not longwear as advertised. With one touch all the makeup in that spot comes off. There's also patches on my face like the tip of my nose where it litteraly won't stick. At first I thought it didn't mix well with my primer so I tried various ones. Still wouldn't stick and my nose wasn't oily at all. Just really weird. Hopefully it works better for someone else, but it just didn't work at all for me.",0
I really wanted to love this - it's a gorgeous light glow - but it broke the first time I used it! The spray nozzle doesn't work anymore and I can't get any of the product out when the bottle is full. Huge bummer and waste of money.,4
"I really wanted to love this product after I saw a YT reviewer rave about it. However, it's just not working for me.  I've tried it both over night and as a day cream for a 5hr plane flight and each time the following day I've broken out on my chin. I have very sensitive, dry acne prone skin.  I so wish this had worked for me.",0
I really wanted to love this product because I did hear good things about it but could only give it one star for 3 reasons!...1. I broke out like crazy immediately after 1 day! 2. I think it would look best on liquid foundation and I only use powdered  and was finding my foundation wouldn't stick and was blotchy! 3. I didn't like the feel of it. It is very sticky and stays that way! \nMy skin hasn't look this bad in a long time!,4
"I really wanted to love this product. I am fortunate to have great skin - normal, no issues or dry patches or oiliness. This foundation sits on the surface of my skin, or fills in pores in places (like my cheeks) where I have never had that happen. I really have to work to make this look good. I tried the Tatcha Silk Canvas primer, did not use a ton of product and really buffed it in. I still had areas (around my nose) where it was visibly sitting on the surface of my skin. Not a pretty look. I am going to keep trying to make this work - maybe a moisturizer instead of primer, a different brush (the Real Techniques face expert brush did a decent job of working it into the skin), or a different applicator - sponge or cushion foundation sponge. I've been using and loving the Armani Power Fabric Balm foundation and do not have the same issues with it.",3
"I really wanted to love this product. I tried it for six months trying to convince myself to like it. I have combination to oily skin. I tried everything for extra moisturizer and a primer, just primer, no primer, multiple primers actually, and nothing worked. It always would break up on my skin. AS I PUT IT ON. I couldn't get the look I wanted without completely caking that area. It does cling to dry patches if you don't exfoliate well enough, and sometimes even if you have exfoliated. It does have great coverage and lasts a long time. I wore it for sorority recruitment in the blistering heat and freak rain shower, stayed in place perfectly. While I did wear this for six months to give it more than one season and really try it out... I don't think I will repurchase because of the way it breaks up on my skin. Other than those things it is a great product and does work well for some people, just not me. ❤️",0
"I really wanted to love this - was excited to try it after reading the reviews. Unfortunately, it causes my face to feel greasy; not just in the T-zone, but the entire face. I didn't break out, which is good. But I don't like the greasy feeling. It's what I want to avoid, which is why I choose a water-based cream or gel-cream. But others love it, so it's definitely good for many skin types. Just not mine, sadly.",2
I really wanted to love this with all I had but I just liked it. It definitely is super creamy and thick and I used my fingers to blend it in very well. I liked the coverage under my eyes but when I put my concealer and the setting powder I felt like it looked cracked. I got this complimentary in my influenster voxbox and I am glad I got it there. Not to say I would never get it  but maybe I would try another of their colors.,4
"I really wanted to try this as soon as I seen it pop up online! I ordered it as fast as my LCD screen could receive the data. I'm really glad I did. I had been having lots of stress breakouts, or that's what I'm assuming they were because I never have had\nany kind of acne up until this point in my 39 years. but what almost became a nightmare I would never have time to deal with, was combated by this stuff! my skin felt smooth, but not stripped, and it looked like I had spent the day at the spa! I'll be ordering more!",2
"I really was worried about the products based on some reviews on here.  However I bought it anyway because I've been dying to try the blush for years. I wasn't and am not sorry. Yes the lip balm does color your lips with a very light wash of pink. So if you were hoping for lipstick this ain't it, it is a balm. I wear it most days. Love it, adds a little bit of color. The blush I wore it recently while trying another product out and it gave me that lightly rosey cheek healthy look, so beautiful! I totally think this is a good buy for several reasons, I don't hit pan often on blushes or bronzer so this mini set will last me which to me four products that all work, I'm in!",3
"I received a deluxe sample in the YSL VIB+Rouge gift and i love it! At first when I saw the color I thought here we go again with the outrageously pink ""nudes"" that just look ridiculous on women of browner hues...and then I tried it. Very buildable and natural looking. Not sticky and dries down to a nice shiny gloss look. Also smells good. I will add that my lips are slightly tingly BUT I literally just wiped off UD HI-FI Shine (in shade Dirty Talk) and that gloss has peppermint oil in it so I will have to try it again on a day I didn't use the other gloss first.",1
"I received a deluxe sample of this product in my Playbox. I really like this as an essence quite a bit! I currently use a significantly more expensive essence that I love, but I am considering purchasing this as well and alternate between the two. I especially like it after microneedling or after an acid peel. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I still prefer my other essence, but if I could no longer use that one, I would definitely switch to this one!",4
"I received a free sample of this and I fell in love with it! Goes on so smooth,very silky. Doesn't take a lot to cover face either. Was able to use three times(sample) and it left my skin feeling lushous and plump. Will definitely be purchasing a full size!",0
I received a free sample of this from Pinch Me. I was already loyal to this brand. I think they make great products for a great price. I was just as pleased with this product as I am with everything they make.,2
"I received a free sample of this product from Influenster for reviewing purposes.  I wasn't sure what to expect with it, but I'm pleasantly surprised.  The serum did not irritate my skin, even after several weeks of use, and overall it seems that my facial skin texture has improved.  I'm considering adding this to my daily routine.",1
I received a full size bottle of this to test out. Overall it applies well to the eye area. I prefer the C tango over this for the firming aspects it has. For someone younger this is a good eye serum to start out with. It will start to tackle the early signs of aging. I'm hitting 40 next year and need something a little stronger.,4
"I received a full size jar of this in a subscription box. I was so excited because I have been wanting to try it. I'm pretty disappointed, and would never purchase this product after trying it. I'm 34 with normal combination skin. This feel like dragging wax across my skin. It does not sink it. It just sits on the surface and feels suffocating. It does not allow your skin to breath. You can feel the sweat pooling around your hair line and lips. I'm glad I did not pay for this product. I'm using it as an expensive hand cream, just so it doesn't go to waste.",1
I received a sample in the mail. This is a pleasant lightweight moisturizer with a mild lemon scent. Absorbs quickly and leaves no shine or greasy feeling. I wouldn't buy it myself but this would be fantastic for a tween/teenager or someone with extremely oily skin.,1
"I received a sample of this and quickly decided to buy a full size bottle. This stuff is amazing but it does clog my pores but nothing major. I use this about twice a week in the evening and when I wake my face looks and feels so smooth. For that reason I will be a long time customer. A small pimple that I can put a pimple patch on and get rid of overnight, well it's a no brainer.  This stuff is amazing and I love the smell.",3
"I received a sample of this a while ago, and I really loved it for my bra length platinum processed hair. It applies really well and smells great, so I ignored the negative reviews and purchased the mini for myself. It is literally a deluxe mini sample for $18. NO WAY am I willing to pay that. Requested a return immediately!",1
I received a sample of this in my Play! box this month and used it the first time this AM. I have very puffy under eyes in the AM and it usually takes hours for the puffiness to go away. I literally watched the puffiness disappear as I was applying my makeup this AM. No other product I have used has done anything that reduced the puffiness. Very impressed - ordering a full size.,3
I received a sample of this in of the past birthday gifts from sephora and fell in love! Sadly my sample was lost at a con so I had to purchase a full size one before they were totalled fazed out. it's super creamy and doesn't dry out my lips it's a lovely neutral color and the scent doesn't bother my sensitive nose!,0
I received a sample of this lipstick as a point bonus and I really love this formula. I'm usually just a tinted lip balm or sometimes lip gloss (if I being fancy) kind of girl and I really liked this. It feels very moisturizing on the lips and the colour was the perfect your lips but better shade.  Will be purchasing a full size.,4
"I received a sample of this using rewards points and have been using it for two weeks. I've just purchased the full-size and hope it's as good. I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, and I've tried dozens of moisturizers including Cerave and Drunk Elephant Lala Retro. This is probably one of the most hydrating moisturizers I've used. The consistency is thicker than most so a few dabs is enough to cover the face. The smell is fresh and citrus-y. I use this in conjunction with TO Niacinamide and my skin has never felt so plump and dewy. This cream is quite nourishing and good to follow 'actives' in your skincare routine. Not sure if it's the TO, but I haven't had any breakouts using this. It's probably too heavy to use in warmer weather, but I'll be using this through the dry California winter.",0
"I received a sample packet of Beauty zzZz from another company.  It seemed to help me sleep more soundly, so I bought a bottle from Sephora.  After two weeks of use, I KNOW now that it works for me.  It contains a low dose of simple ingredients and I wake refreshed. The only way I'd give 5 stars is if I slept 8 hours without ever waking.  My menopausal self is probably the issue.  I recommend it.",3
"I received a small sample of this product for review. I am a huge fan of Estee Lauder products but I am not sure how I felt about this. the sample I recieved wasnt enough to give a full and honest review. I was only able to use it for 3 days. I will say that after applying it, my skin did feel smooth. I definitely will  purchase a full size size",2
I received Benefit's Boi-ing Cakeless Concealer from Influester in return for my honest review.  I have used this concealer for the past four days and am very happy with it. it covers my dark circles and blemishes completely without settling in fine lines or looking cakey.  At first I thought the shade was going to be too light but it matches well..  I think the bottle is super cute and am happy I got to try it out.  I would definitely recommend this to friends.,3
I received GLAMGLOW #BRIGHTEYES Illuminating Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream for #free to review. I suffer from dark circles and puffy eyes regardless if I get enough sleep. I noticed a significant difference after using the product day and night. It helped to reduce the puffiness that surrounds my eyes and lighten the dark circles. It keeps my eyes hydrated so that throughout the day my eyes no longer feel tight due to dryness. This has been a much needed addition to my skincare regimen.\n\n#GLAMFAM #ad #freesample,1
I received it as a complimentary gift from influenster 2 weeks ago . and using it for 2 weeks I can confidently say that its an amazing product to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles . it's at home facial device that is easy to use and is very effective . I would definitely be buying it for my mom this Christmas.,4
"I received it from Influenster to test it and I've used it for about 3 weeks now. The coverage is very good and light weight. I regret not getting my real shade because it has become one of my favorites. I would probably use it more around summer since it gives me a very bronzed color. \n\nIt couldn't handle the oilyness of my face, but none of my foundations do. So, brands, if you need a face to test your foundations against someone really oily, I'M HERE! \nI totally recommend it if you have a mild oily skin to normal. Otherwise, it will come off around the 6th hour of wearing it.",0
"I received mine this morning and all day, I kept checking my reflection in the mirror, expecting to be disappointed but instead, I kept being happily surprised by how dang good my undereyes looked, how fresh, like I had just done my makeup. I think some of the poor reviews come from a misunderstanding that this is, like, a treatment for dark circles. It's an undereye primer that smooths the surface of the skin to put your concealer on. I followed the advice of another reviewer who said that she didn't blend it in well, that it was better to have it sit on the surface. Then concealer and a light dusting of powder, she said using a beauty blender added texture. I did that and I think my eyes looked the best that they have in probably ten years as the day wears on. Definitely recommend for mature skin like mine.",2
"I received Payday and Interview complimentary from Influenster for an honest review. I personally prefer liquid lipsticks after years of trying multiple formulations in my quest for the best lip products when it comes to payoff, longevity, and comfort. My typical routine includes a base layer of lip primer but I tried these lipsticks with and without. I've found that without a primer, these lipsticks are more on the dry side and drag quite a bit, setting into my lip lines. With a layer on Mac lip prep and prime under these lipsticks, I find the wear to be way more comfortable. Interview and payday are definitely lighter than shades is normally wear, being a fan of a bright lip. I'd say two passes gives good coverage and leaves me with a nude lip. Unlike most bullet lipsticks, this actually doesn't leave me with a naked patch on the inside of my lip. Wear is above average, it lasted past an entire meal.",2
"I received some samples of cbd oils and have been really looking forward to trying them. I received this flora + bast, herbivore, and saint jane. the pros of the flora + bast are that it absorbs quickly, helps with my irritated acne prone skin, very moisturizing, improved skin tone and texture, the cbd potency, and doesnt cause any negative skin reaction. the cons are the smell (I like the smell of weed) but this stuff smells like resin or super stale weed, and the ingredients dont include cannabidiol. that's the reason that a knocked off 1 star. the best of the 3 tried is the saint jane, then the herbivore, then this flora + bast. if the herbivore was more potent, I'd rank it above saint jane due to the price difference even tho I wish it had at least 300mg of cbd. I went ahead and purchased the saint jane because I could afford it, but if the price is too steep and you want 300mg, the flora + bast is really good! I cant speak to long term use yet tho.",4
"I received the Agatha from Influenster free for reviewing purposes and became OBSESSED with the lipstick. Intense color, moisturizing, doesn't feather on aging lips (I'm 40). Scented, so not for perfume allergies. The ""orange"" is closer to vermilion and is surprisingly easy to wear. plus, I don't usually review on packaging, but this tube is so gorgeous that I have to make an exception. Heavy in the hand with elegant etched pattern. Online doesn't do it justice. I feel like a 30's screen goddess taking this out of a bag! I'd been planning to get another in a more classic color, so now that it's my birthday I'm buying the Teresina ruby red as well.",2
"I received the Bounce & Blur eyeshadow palette in Dusk complimentary for the purpose of my review.\nAt first, I was not a fan! I tried using my brushes and i felt like there was very little pigmentation.\nAfter some research I found that BareMinerals explained that this palette was designed to use your fingertips with. It COMPLETELY changed my look. I was able to blend and get beautiful color pay-off.\nI think that this palette would be perfect for beginners or for someone who is intimidated with the make up process.\nI only gave four stars because i feel like 5 colors for $30 is a little steep. Plus i feel like the two dark colors are super similar.",1
I received the Boxycharm version of this palette  and I was super disappointed. The colors were absolutely gorgeous but faded and creased so quickly. They smudged all together and looked terrible only a few hours into wearing.,1
"I received the cute sample size and mitt from Influenster for testing purposes, and I really, really loved it! The texture is phenomenal. I'm partial to clay masks, and this is the epitome of a fantastic one. The ingredients are amazing, and I love that it's certified clean at Sephora (huge plus!). I really enjoy how this mask is full coverage and it applies evenly (unlike many masks I've tried). I didn't need a ton of product to cover my entire face. The scent is fresh and clean and not overbearing (I'm very sensitive to smell). My skin was left feeling firmed, but not in a tight or unpleasant way. My oiliness on my nose area disappeared and stayed gone for quite some time. In no way did this dry out my face like other clay masks can. My only issue is the price! I really hope I'll be able to splurge and get this, but the price point is rough-- especially when I have my favorite masks at a fraction of the price.",0
"I received the @KateSomervilleskincare @sephora Kate Somerville retinol vitamin C moisturizer for complementary testing purposes. The jar is amazing because you simply press down and it springs forth a perfect amount for your face and neck. It smells fresh and has a pleasant citrus sent. I have used the retinol vitamin C moisturizer for 2 weeks and I must admit I see a brighter tone to my skin and it looks plump. I am so excited to see how my skin looks by the end of this month, just in time for the holiday season. I will be ready to ""face"" all of my friends and family!",3
"I received the mini version of the camel palette. I love all the colors of this palette and have always want to try this fancy expensive eyeshadow.  It glides on very smoothly, no blotchy areas and stays on all day. But so does Tarte, UD, Smasbox for half the price. Dont get me wrong, its great eyeshadow but no eyeshadow is worth $48.00.",4
"I received the Murad Night Fix Enzyme Treatment from the brand to try, and used it for the first time last night.  I understand that results are never immediate and it usually takes 3-4 weeks before you start seeing the real benefits and results of the skincare product.  However, I noticed a subtle softness to my skin the morning after the Night Fix Enzyme.  I like that fact that this is the final step to my PM skincare routine.  Kind of like how it seals in all my other skincare products, including my nighttime moisturizer.  I will continue to use this for the whole month to see the final results, but so far so good",1
"I received the Perricone MD No Makeup Lipstick in Rose, and it's the perfect my-lips-but-better color! The color looks rather dark on the website but it's not. See my photo for how it actually looks like. The Rose is a neutral tone that will work with both cool and warm skin tones.\n\nThe lipstick comes in a bullet case with a polished hematite finish that has a heft to it and feels high quality. Unlike most other bullet lipsticks where you have to pop the cap off, this one is a twist-cap. There were times when I've damaged my other lippies with the pop-off caps, so it's good that there won't be a chance of damage with this one. \n\nThe formula is moisturizing on my super dry lips. There's a slight vanilla scent that smells pretty good. Best part really is the broad spectrum SPF protection! Since I'm going outdoors during summer a lot, the Perricone MDNo Makeup Lipstick has become my go-to! I usually go either minimal no-makeup makeup, or playful color on the eyes which requires the lips to be understated, so this lipstick is perfect for me. \n\nThe only thing improvement is that I wish is that the lipstick is not cut flat across (to accomodate the logo?) because it really makes it inconvenient to apply without a more precise tip. \n\nAnyway, Perricone MD has done it again when it comes to giving you the ""I just woke up like this"" look! I've been a fan of Perricone MD's No Makeup product line (especially their No Makeup Foundation!), so I was really excited when Influenster told me I'd be getting this in my Voxbox. Even though I received this product for free for testing purposes, I'll definitely be stocking up once I run out of it.",2
I received the Primers Miracle Seed Oil from Influenster’s voxbox. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed great results. The product came with a full size of the miracle seed essence and cotton pads to use along side the miracle seed essence. The product at first feels a bit sticky but it dries up and you don’t even feel it anymore. I have noticed my skin has been moisturized and the dry flakes that I once had are gone. I will definitely buy this product once my bottle runs out (which won’t be for a while!),0
"I received this as a complimentary sample for review purposes. Once I received it, I tried it with several primers, setting sprays, and powders to see how well this foundation would perform, and let tell you did it ever perform!!! As a busy teacher at a middle school, I don't have time to mess with my makeup, once it's on, that's it. This foundation stayed put even after 14 hours of wear, on the daily. My only complaint is that I wish it would be full coverage. Even with building up, you can only get a solid medium coverage out of this foundation. As for the scent, this depends on your sensitivity. As a mother of 4 as well as a middle school teacher, the Dior scent is not something that is overpowering for me, as I have heard in others who have reviewed Dior products. This product has all that you need in a foundation: beautiful finish, staying power, and most importantly built-in SPF without that SPF smell. This has become my new ride or die foundation! I truly do love it!",2
"I received this as a free product to test through influenster. I've never tried a cream contour and highlight before and typically the high price tag and the unknown of how to use cream products would scare me off, however this product is amazing! With such fair skin typically I have a hard time with contour and bronzer shades being either too orange or dark. This shade however was perfect! the cream formula blended perfectly into the skin and on top of foundation but I also think it would perform beautifully under foundation as well. The high price tag is still a tad scary but definitely worth it. 10/10 would repurchase!",1
"I received this as a free sample to test. I will cut straight to the chase: this is by far the best facial moisturizer I've always used. I've tried high end brands and drug store brands for my night moisturizer and none of them last through the night. After using this once, my dry tight skin feels and looks hydrated without any slime, wet, or clump texture. I'm in love with the bottle design as well; one pump is all I need to smooth over my face and it doesn't leave a residue. \n\nThis moisturizer feels light despite having a thick connotation that usually comes with the word ""cream."" I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a second moisturizer at night. I use this after applying toner, serum, and a light moisturizer.",0
"I received this as a gift from Influenster and it's honestly great. No word of a lie, it goes on smooth, smells DELICIOUS and barely feels like it's on your skin. I have hyperpigmentation and fine lines on my forehead. No wrinkle clearing yet but I think it's starting to work on my dark spots. I'm wearing it right now as I type!",4
"I received this as a mini in the Amore Pacific Summer Sun Safety kit. It is literally the bomb of all sunscreens. Smells amazing, isn't greasy and provides a nice fine mist application. Don't know where it's been all my life. Love!",3
"I received this as a sample and I will definitely be buying the full size! I have a big issue with my mascara bleeding under my eyes part way through the day, this hasn't! I've tried quite a few different formulations and brands and this is the first that I haven't had issue with.",4
"I received this as a sample and was skeptical as I have yet to find a concealer that works on my mature skin (I'm 56 but with few lines and wrinkles). This is amazing! It blends out so well and stays put without creasing or flaking. I used it to help create a no foundation/glowing face look too. It blended perfectly on the areas where I needed a bit of coverage such as round the nose, forehead and chin. This shade is a little light for me (and is actually called Moderately Fair) but I will purchase a full size in a slightly darker color.",3
"I received this as part of my voxbox. The quality of the lashes are great, however I just think they’re a little too over the top for my asian eyes. I would recommmend these only for those who have a larger eye area, but maybe it could be doable for a glamorous night out with lots of eyeshadow makeup!",0
"I received this Benefit Boiing concealer for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster.\nI have to say this concealer took some time to get used to. I tried it first with a beauty blender, but it didn't work so well. Then I tried applying it just with my fingertips, while it worked better, it didn't blend as well as I thought it would. It started to accentuate my fine lines and small wrinkles. I have mature skin, and that's a no-go!\nNext I tried applying my foundation first, then the Benefit concealer. It worked better then the other ways but I'm still not sold on this product. If I had young 20 y.o skin, maybe this would be fabulous. In any case, I won't be buying a second round of this product. I am usually a big fan of Benefit's products. But not this one. Overall, if u have mature skin, look elsewhere for a product that won't accentuate your wrinkles and fine lines. #Boiing #GotItFree #BebefitBeauty #Influenster",2
"I received this cleanser as part of my October birthday gift, a big enough size to allow me to use it once daily for 2 full weeks, and I am impressed with it. I use it in the morning, and CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser at night. It has a light gel-like texture that transforms into a foam after I add water. It is fragrance free, and leaves no film or residue on my skin and neck after rinsing. My skin feels clean, refreshed, and hydrated. I am thinking about buying the full size and making it my regular cleanser. BTW, I am 65, dry skin.",4
"I received this complimentary for review and love it! My shade is deep 92. I am oily with hyperpigmentation spots and prefer a full coverage matte foundation without the heavy feel...this product delivered! The coverage is medium, but buildable in a natural matte finish. Best part, it feels like nothing and lasts all day. I'm impressed with how well the deep shades were formulated in terms of pigment and undertone. I love the dispenser, it reminds me of airbrush foundation...in fact so does the consistency which is probably why it delivers an airbrush-like finish. I used a dense flat top foundation brush and stippled it on; one drop on each side of my face and done! You MUST shake this well prior to use, and I recommend avoiding high silicone primers with this or it will slide around.",2
"I received this foundation complimentary for testing purposes and was so excited to try it out. I love the shaker pen style and that you only require a few small drops. The foundation applies easily, dries matte and is very lightweight but still provides enough coverage.",1
"I received this free for review from #Influenster.  I have been using this serum for about 3 days now and I notice a definite difference in my skin. It is more taut and firm. I apply this after cleansing my face, before my moisturizer.  I will probably purchase this once I run out! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",3
I received this from Influencer and I am in love. If you have dry or mature skin this is a great concealer for you. I have very watery eyes and allergies. This worked great for me and I have dark circles as well. I did set this very very lightly.,3
I received this from influenster and I absolutely love the packaging ! the colors are gorgeous and blend well and easily ! the shimmer shades are beautiful and so soft pigmented and just all around gorgeous ! this is my first product from this brand and I will definitely be purchasing more !,1
"I received this from influenster and so far it's my favorite item. bc the results are so quick. I hated my forehead wrinkles and that's what I targeted for this trial of the product and wow I'm blown away. only used it for two days and after the second days use my forehead wrinkles were nearly completely diminished and even the little bump I had there was cleared up so much faster than it would have on its own. I honestly wouldn't have paid any mind to this device bc of the price tag but now that I have experienced it and know how effective and fast it is, I'd probably buy this now and also recommend it to anyone wanting to treat fine lines and wrinkles. my skin also feels so nice and firm once I use this.  I just wish you could use your own serums with it.  in the pic, the first image is the before and the second is the after. mind you this is only after two uses!!!",1
"I received this from influenster for review. After trying it out a few times, I think this is a good foundation but it isn't something I would repurchase.  I have sensitive skin and this did not break me out. It is a thinner consistency, and easy to blend. It does have a slight blurring effect on the pores, and the finish is just as described. It looks and feels very skin like. I wouldn't consider this a true matte, but I actually like that it's more of a natural matte. I am not sure it holds up to the 24 hour wear claim because I did not leave it on that long. However it did stay looking pretty fresh for the 5-8 hours that I wore it. And I did not feel the need to set this with a powder, it did well on its own. I read some other reviewers complain about oxidization, but I don't think it really oxidized on me. I did get the color 3wo, which was a good match maybe slightly on the lighter side so that could be why I didn't notice any oxidization. It applies well with both a sponge and brush. Overall, this is a pretty good foundation but I find that it doesn't really provide the coverage that I was expecting. I have some hyperpigmentation that still shows through after 2 thin layers. I don't really like doing multiple layers of foundation so I did not try building this up further. I tend to compare everything to the MUFE HD because that's my go to, and this just falls short of the coverage a little bit. I would also say this is comparable to the lancome teint idol 24 hour in terms of consistency and wear.",4
I received this Fromm Influenster to try out.  The color pay off was ok. Nothing to brag about. I loved the packaging of it and it did perform pretty well. I sprayed my brush with fix   to get better payoff.,0
"I received this in a 500 pt vib gift.  I usually don't like volumizing mascaras and ones with a bushy brush like this as i feel they can look clumpy but this one was not clumpy at all. I felt it defined and gave natural volume to my lashes, nothing overly dramatic so if you are looking for over the top volume this isn't probably for you. It made my lashes soft and  they didn't feel stiff. I like it.",2
"I received this in a VoxBox from Influenster! This is my first eye liner pen from Kat Von D and I like it!\n\nI primed and applied. I find it easy to glide across my eyelid and make a thin line as my hooded eyes only have so much room so thin line it is. The tip is a bit softer than I expected but I like how it made it easier to do my inner eye.\n\nIt dries nicely as a matte black and lasted my full day until I got home.\n\nI store mine on an incline, which may be why it hasn't dried out as the fluid is towards the tip. I tap it upside down on my hand before using it, and try it quickly on my hand before starting. Other people mentioned a dry tip...I haven't had this issue but with other pens I just take a damp cloth to squeeze the tip or dip it gently in water. \n\nAlso removal was easy so thank you Kat Von D for not staining or making me horrible rub my eyelids.",1
"I received this in my monthly subscription box and I love it!  I use this all the time-before bed, during the day, and before bed.  It is the absolute best lip healer around.  It works well with lip liners and lipsticks.  I just put a little on, let it absorb while I put the rest of my makeup on, and then put on my liner and lipstick. I swear it keeps my lips so hydrated that those ugly little lines around the lips disappear.  It also does not make my extended stay lip products bleed.  It does not feel sticky either.  I cannot recommend this product enough!",3
"I received this in my Play!Box,and it's way to dark! Was hard to get off, as well! I'm a little bit upset how tiny it is and it's really hard to work with! I also was suppose to get another Play! Box :( Sorry for venting! This is my opinion!",3
"i received this in shade 2 from Influenster for review purposes. this shade was a little on the light side for me but the big benefit for me was that a little product goes a long way. you don't need a lot to decently cover dark circles and blemishes. also, you have to be quick when blending because this stuff dries quick. i also liked that tis stayed put throughout the day but i'm not sure that it's waterproof. i would love to try this in my right shade, though.",2
"I received this item from Influenster. I was Nervous to try it (I wrote a review for the device in which I share this) but this product is kinda neat! I received a small one, so I’ll have to repurchase the larger size when I run out, but it’s an interesting product! It’s kind of like a gel texture, and it goes on very easily. I left It on my skin and then used circular motions and light sliding. It makes using the device really fun and easy. It doesn’t have a smell really and it’s sorta clear sort of beige ish. It’s thick but after you use it you don’t feel any residue, It almost feels tighter and more open. I will try again in the morning and am hopeful it will be a great start to the day before makeup.",0
"I received this item through Influenster. I only write honest reviews and am glad to share in beauty/health/wellness because I love finding and using products that make my life easier/better. This product is actually decent! I was nervous to try it but I’m really glad I did! The lines under my eye are definitely less noticeable (within seconds) and the lines on my forehead are also less noticeable but not as impressively gone as under my eyes. I will also try this on my smile lines but am assuming it’s going to work based on what I already see. The device slightly zaps (most people aren’t even going to feel it) but I did a little bit. More so for my eyes than on my forehead. The device vibrates and you charge it, it seems like it would be really easy to travel with and honestly, I’m impressed that it comes with a little cover for the top, I wont ever be worried that it’s getting dirty sitting in a makeup bag or in the cabinet with other products. A lot of other devices and gadgets don’t have covers (like the foreo laser or your regular tweezers, etc) so that part is really nice. Mine came in white, is sleek and not bulky or cumbersome. Overall; my eyes and forehead look tighter and more plumped. I did my first treatment at night but it would be great doing it in the morning too before applying makeup. I could see this making one look more awake, vibrant and present. I’m a migraine sufferer and sometimes my eyes look a little droopy, I also work on camera and you can tell the difference when I look well rested, so this might come in handy on the mornings when I need the extra help. If you’re thinking about getting this, I can honestly say I see results and believe you will too.",0
"I received this lipstick last night and I love it!\nNot sure why it's gritty for other people, mine is quite smooth. It feels and looks great! The color is what I expected. Not giving it 5 stars though, because it is VERY small for the price. Will definitely buy the full size some time.",2
"I received this on behalf of Influenster but after using it for a couple of weeks I think I'll just stick to my Thayers Witch Hazel toner. While this doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, it does contain alcohol which I'm not a huge fan of for toners.",0
I received this palette a few days ago and used it for a night out last night. It’s stunning. It’s also a palette that could be used by all skin types. Each color is highly pigmented and the glittery shades have beautiful glitter coverage. I used the glitter shades on my lash line for a really pretty look. Really excited about the gorgeous fall palette!,0
"I received this product as a free sample and I was not shocked to see that I loved this product. I have loved everything that I’ve tried from Benefit so far! I use this product to fill in the tiny spots in my eyebrows. If you have natural dark (almost black) hair, use shade 4.5 so it looks more natural. I think this product would be great for people with fuller eyebrows because the crayon end isn’t thin and the powder won’t provide a lot of coverage.",0
"I received this product as a free sample fron2 Influenster's. I've been using it for a few weeks now. I honestly dont feel like I can see a difference in my skin at this time. A feel like if I would use it for longer I would start seeing a difference.  The thing I didn't like was the smell, it kinda smelled like egg, which is a no for me, the smell did go away once the product was absorbed. The serum feels nice on the skin, and my skin felt nice afterwards but a bit dry.",1
I received this product as a free sample. I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it for anyone living in a dry climate. It provides the right amount of moisture without leaving your skin greasy. I will definitely continue to use!,4
"I received this product as a free sample. I have only been taking this product for 2 weeks and my skin looks a lot better already, it's smoother and glowing. Maybe it has to do with the better sleep quality I am getting, I have noticed that since I am taking this product I don't wake up in the middle of the night like 10 times, and I am dreaming now! which I don't when I don't get good deep sleep! I will buy this product when I run out.",1
I received this product as a free sample. I really enjoyed how great this mask felt on my skin. I noticed instantly how much brighter and clearer my skin became after using it.  \n The redness in my skin was lessen as well.I highly recommend this product.,1
"I received this product as a free sample just as I was about to purchase it. I've been looking for a ""natural"" looking highlight that is multi functional and Liquid Light in Nova is a dream. I use it many ways... On the high points of my face as a finishing touch and it is light, dries down non tacky and doesn't disrupt my base. Just a dab on the eyelid as a topper to make my shadow pop, and it stays put all day! I have also applied it to my cheeks and high points after primer and before foundation for that glowy look. The last try was mixing a drop into my most matte foundation and it made it brand new and luminous. Of all the Ilia products this one is by far the best. It's very easy to use, it's clean and leaves my sensitive skin is happy and luminous. Will purchase and repurchase!",3
"I received this product as a gift and I love the smell of it. I only use it at night just because I feel that it is too heavy to use during the day but when I wake up the next morning my skin is super soft!! The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price, I wouldn't be able to buy it myself but I'm super happy with my gift!",4
I received this product as a gift from OLEHENRISKEN complimentary to review for testing purposes and I am LIVING for it. I love how my face feels once I wash it off and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about their skincare. The scent is also pleasant and not too overwhelming. I can't wait to continue using this product!,4
I received this product as a sample and just recently purchased the full size. I don't like the oil based texture on my face. I rather use a face cloth. but I discovered it great for removing makeup on your brush. it's removes fast and dry fast as well.,4
"I received this product complementary for testing purposes.  I was excited to try this out as it received so many rave reviews but for my oily, dehydrated skin, this liquid was too greasy and slick.  It also has a disgusting perfumed scent that is so strong.  \n\nI cannot recommend this.",3
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I do not like this product. the pencil side is too waxy and thick that I can't get my brows to look natural. It always looks boxy and thick and I'm not trying to look like that. The other side of the pencil I have 0 control and I have trouble doing hairlike strokes with it.,1
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. The product describes itself as a cream that is anti-aging and moisturizing, and that it also blurs the look of fine lines and wrinkles. I used this product both in the morning and at night, as directed. The first thing you notice about the product is just how beautiful the packaging is. The second is just how moisturizing and thick the product is too. You feel as though a little goes a long way. I wish it came with a little tool to help scoop the product out with so that I didn’t have to use my finger every time. The third thing I noticed was the subtle scent – it smelled good, but it wasn’t overbearingly strong either. The fourth thing I noticed was how easily it absorbed into my skin. There is a stickiness to the skin after application, but I found that applying makeup normally and or using a translucent powder took away that stickiness. The product states that it is ideal for makeup prep around the eye area, so with that in mind: if you do not use eye primer, and you use this on your eyelids, it will cause your eyeshadow to crease more so than normal (I have hooded eyelids). So does this product do as it promises to do? In the morning my fine lines and wrinkles are a little more noticeable, and I would say that it did appear as though it blurred the look of them. It does also feel very moisturizing. After one week of use, I cannot say that it has improved or lessened any of my visible signs of aging around my eyes. I do plan to continue to use this product as directed until empty to see if I notice a difference and can update my review then. However, a little goes a long way, so it will take some time! If you’re looking for a very moisturizing eye cream where a little goes a long way, that also slightly blurs fine lines and fine wrinkles upon application, this is definitely a product to test out. It does give the impression that you get what you pay for.",4
I received this product complimentary from influenster and man what a treat! I love the texture of the cream and it absorbs into the skin so well. it also is great for managing under eye darkness and lines . totally worth it,2
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes. I loved this color. It lasted all night and didn't crease up. It is super pigmented. You can wear this by itself or add it as a pop of color on top of your eyeshadow. I would def recommend this product to others.,1
"I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I wasn’t a fan of this product, it was flaky and smudged immediately after application. I’ve tried it multiple times and had the same results. The brush is nice though and my lashes did look longer but barely. I think there are better mascaras out there.",3
"I received this product for free for review. Let's start with packaging, very sleek and beautifully packaged product. The mirror is the perfect size. I love the colors in the palette and they are very easy to apply. Colors last long and maintain the structure and is very easy to even apply with your fingers. Overall loved this palette.",4
"I received this product for free for review purposes and have been taking them every night for the past 2 weeks. It's too soon to see any skincare results yet but I do notice that I've been sleeping a bit better at since taking them! I used to struggle falling alseep and would wake up multiple times at the slightest sound, but now I fall asleep pretty quickly and actually sleep through the entire night, and I've felt so much better in the mornings as a result! I find the small capsules easy to ingest and the faint taste of peppermint oil is refreshing without being overwhelming.",1
I received this product for free from Influenster for review purposes. So far I am in love. My skin is usually pretty sensitive especially with anything like this. I haven't had a reaction to it at all and I am loving that it is evening out my pigmentation. I like to use it once a week.,1
"I received this product for free in a VoxBox from Influenster for an honest review. I was not a super fan of this product. During the winter months, I have dry skin. I was looking forward to getting this and being able to test it. However, I felt like it didn’t live up to its hype for me. The worst part is the smell. I’m pregnant so smells are amped for me which is a big reason I can’t use it every day. It does do and pretty okay job of nourishing the skin, but I wouldn’t call it a primer. My make up looked and stayed on as long is it does without primer. Like I said, for nourishing, it definitely does it’s job.",0
I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I really liked the applicator and how it feels on the skin. It makes it easy to use and feels nice and cool. I think I would have to use it for longer to see other changes.,0
"I received this product for free to test. Great mascara but Asian brands such as etude house curl fix are still better for short straight Asian lashes like mine. After curling I applied just one coat of this mascara and my curl sort of fell. That's no surprise, most mascaras I use are like that. I think I could probably curl my lashes again after the first coat but I left it because it wasn't bad. I didn't try to go in for a second coat but even with one coat I could see a difference in the volume. I was surprised that this mascara also lengthens a bit. It didn't blow my mind but its a good formula and I'd probably keep using the tube I received. Would I buy it again? Most likely not as I prefer the ones that are designed for Asian lashes.",4
"I received this product free for review from Influenster. I really like the consistency of this product. It starts as a liquid and has a powder finish. The medium coverage isn’t cakey or thick, and it lasts all day. I had no issues with irritation or breakouts, and I really like that it is a vegan formula. It comes in a wide range of colours, and the packaging is really pretty and chic. I would recommend.",0
"I received this product free for review from Influenster.\nThe formula for this primer is very runny. A little goes a long way! I don't think my tube was very full but, like I said, a little goes a long way. My eyelids tend to get oily and I have noticed that sometimes that does start to affect my makeup even with this primer. Overall it holds on to pigment very well and I'd recommend it!",4
"I received this product free for review purposes from Amore Pacific. Youth Revolution Vitamin C Radiance Concentrator which is a vitamin C, liquid dual phase serum ~ it is supposed to help with softening fine lines",3
I received this product free for testing. \nThe foundation is nice and light weight. It’s buildable in coverage. I don’t think it works with my oily skin type in this humid weather. I’ll try to use this during fall/spring.,0
"I received this product free in order to review and it honestly had really nice coverage for a moisturizer. I tried out 3N1 Walnut and it covered my blemishes while also giving my skin some hydration and protection. I think this tinted moisturizer is great for that no makeup makeup look that most people want in the summer. I added some mascara, dis my brows and was out the door to enjoy my day sans foundation, concealer, or anything else. I think this will be my go to for beach days and days I want to look fresh faced.",0
"I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes only.  I thought that I had tried every effective retinol and vitamin C cream(s) on the market but I was wrong. From the very first night I followed the instructions after cleansing my face I added a thin, even layer.  MUCH to my surprise I could see a visible difference THE VERT NEXT MORNING.  It tingled just a tiny bit when I put it on as the instructions say it might and when I cleansed my face the next morning it tingled again, obviously still working! I truly wish I would have taken a before/ after shot because I've only been using it a couple of weeks and the fine lines across my forehead and beside my mouth are already almost gone.  This normally takes a couple of months to achieve when first beginning some so-called ""high-potency"" products. No matter what it takes this will forever be part of my night time regimen from now on! #KateCan  @KateSomervilleSkincare  \n@Sephora #Influenster",3
"I received this product from Influenster to give my honest review! I've been using it for almost a month, and I can honestly say I've noticed a great improvement, especially for my puffy under eyes. The thing I love most about this eye mask is that it doesn't feel thick and uncomfortable like the others I have tried. A little goes a long way, and the little scoop it comes with is so helpful!",0
"I received this product gratis for purposes of review. I love this mascara!  It is better than BTS. \n\nIt does not clump or flake during the day.  The brush is large but I had no trouble using it, even on my inner lashes.  \n\nI don't think this formula adds a lot of volume, but it definitely adds length.  Makes my lashes look like strip lashes with only 2 coats! \n\nI will definitely purchase this when I run out, it's great!",3
"I received this product in my Sephora Play box. I had almost forgot about it because I was working through other skincare items before starting something new. I wish I had found this sooner because I loved it! For me it worked instantly and provided good moisture. I have used R&F eye brightener, Korean eye creams like Saranghae, Fresh, other higher end products, etc., and this is truly da bomb! I would recommend this for anyone who struggles with puffy, dark eyes.",4
I received this product to try and am fascinated by it. I've been using it for 5 days now and can see a slight change on my skin. I have expression wrinkles on my forehead and am noticing they are softening. This cream has a delightful orange acent and it's a big bottle. I love the ease of use. I totally recommend this product.,3
I received this sample for free and it truly is the best top coat I have ever used in my life which is saying a lot. It is not sticky at all and just a little bit gives your lips a beautiful glow and shine as well as deeply moisturizes.   So my lips not only look great but they feel great.\n\n The minute then I tried this I ordered the full size of the clear and the bronze. I can't wait to try the bronze and this is going to be a staple until the end of time.,3
I received this serum along with the Caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet for a birthday gift from Sephora a while back. I love how hydrating it is but it still irritated my super sensitive skin. With the sample size it is hard to tell if it needed more time to work but I didn't see a change in my skin tone at all. The serum did have a slight brightening effect though!,2
I received this today and very pleased. I used the online matching to a foundation and it gave me Sienna 10.  I also noticed facial fine line coverage. It goes on light and I like using it under my Make Up Forever Bronzer.,3
"I received three products from this range via Influenster and have been using them for about two months now, and I can safely say I love this serum! I will repurchase it bc it’s almost gone. I’ve been using two pumps day and night and have seen quick results, much better than the serum I was using before. \nWhile it’s not cheap, it’s worth every dollar!",2
I Recently added Tidal into my Daily Regimen I use Sunday Riley Products and I use The Vitamin C Serum and the C.E.O. Moisturizer but I use Tidal during the day with Sunday Riley Vitamin C Serum and it just give that Beautiful Glow from within. I just wouldn't say that this is the Most Ultimate Best Mosturizer like this out there because there are Many Others just like this Moisturizer that are much more cheaper that do the same that this does so I'm Not so sure if Next time I'd reach for Tidal but it is a Nice Product. I also have Very Sensitive Skin and had No issues and it wore well with Makeup.,3
"I recently bought a selection of natural, aluminum-free deodorants from Sephora. I have used natural, aluminum-free deodorants for years, so I did not have any detox period. This stick has a sort of manly smell, but it's really pleasant. It works well too! I'm not sure it works as well as Healthy Deodorant, but I am rotating Healthy Deoderant and this stick. The stick has a weird texture, with strange bumps and lumps. Additionally, the packing seems off- I get scraped in my armpits when I apply... which sucks because the stick is super moisturizing!! Would give 5 stars if packaging didnt scratch me.",1
"I recently bought this from Sephora because the products have excellent reviews and I really wanted to try them. As soon as I got the package, though, I knew I needed to return it. The pots for the creams were a decent size, but they were only about two-thirds full. Maybe even less. If I'm going to spend nearly $50 on a set, I want to get as much product as promised. I was disappointed to have to return this product and I would not recommend it.",3
"I recently noticed the crazy dry creasing in my under eye area. I've never had a problem in this area before, but hello 36=)  I sort of became obsessed with finding a solution to my new found problem. I am generally a fan of oils so I decided to look for an oil based concealer. Which led me to this one=) I'm really happy with it , I like it alot. I apply my eye cream and allow a good 15 to 20 mins drying time before applying bc it will break up. So be careful of that. I do get some creasing but lets face it I've come to realize they're all going to crease, but this one is so minimal it's really only noticeable when I'm staring into my magnifying mirror. Perfect for my dry winter skin. I would recommend and buy again.",4
"I recently purchased a gift set with this lip balm, the oil and the rose mask. I used the balm on my lips overnight and I can say my lips were moisturized in the morning and more plump than usual. I was using the Laneige Lip Mask before this but this is much more moisturizing, very impressive.",1
"I recently received a sample of Tatcha's The Water Cream. The first surprise was that the consistency felt like a dupe of Dermalogica's Calm Water Gel. Tatcha costs a ton more. I wouldn't mind the silicones, but Tatcha doesn't add in any ingredients, like lavender, that would prevent breakouts. The biggest sin of The Water Cream is that it contains alcohol. Nope.",3
"I recently recieved this as a free sample to review and have been testing it for a few weeks now. I definitely enjoy this brand overall and this product is another solid addition. It doesn't  have unnecessary added fragrance and it seems to help liven up my skin a bit. I will say that it is a bit heavy for my oily skin, though,  so I've been using it at night. If you have very dry skin then you might enjoy it in the morning as well.",4
"I recently used the product, Dr. Dennis Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. I can't say enough, AMAZING!! After using just one treatment my skin was glowing! This peel made my face extreemly smooth and clear as if I had a professional facial at a expensive salon!",3
"I recieved all of the sephora masks as an insider perk. Unfortunately so far the purple clay mask is a complete miss. It has a strong synthetic fragrance and the mask tingles a little bit on any sensitive spot on my face (chin, around my nostrils, and upperlip). It doesnt provide any moisture to my face and if any of the mask is left on I break out.\n\nPositives - this is a decent price point and you get about 4- 5 fully face uses (probably more but I was very generous with the product)",1
"I recieved a sample of this and decided to try the full size. The color was a great match for me. It is a great dewy medium coverage. perfect for my dry skin. It does need set with a powder. The name has confused a lot of people because it sounds like it should be a foundation and concealer with a lot of coverage, but it isn't. however it is a nice medium coverage. I would not recommend for oily skin.",0
"I recieved a sample of this and used it for a couple of days. Within two days, my bumpiness came back and my pores were clogged and inflamed again. I had been working at treating these problems since I have a combination of inflammatory and comedomal acne, but this brought them back. It also made me oily again, which my current skincare routine had been treating. It was the only new addition so it had to be this. I did do my research ahead of time to make sure none of my other products were reacting with it, so I also doubt it could be that. Not suited for me at all :(",4
"I recieved a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and I HAD to order it right away. Ipsy was sold out so I came to Sephora. Now I am addicted to this eye cream AND shopping at Sephora.  \nI am 47 years old and have been using eye cream since I was in my mid 20's. Needless to say, I do not have a lot of eye wrinkles, just some fine lines that need plumping. This Belif product moisturizers my eye area perfectly and minimizes my fine lines. No one believes me when I tell them my age. This also doesn't interfere with my makeup as it absorbs nicely. \n\nI am licensed esthetician and the two products I always recommend to my clients are eye cream and sun screen.  Your eyes and sun damage will age you. Take care of those things and you will stay looking younger. Start with this eye cream. It's one of the best I have ever tried.",3
"I recieved the cool light blonde shade. I love that it has the pencil and powder all in one product. I used the pencil to line and powder to fill. It was so easy to use and my brows look great everytime I use it. I prefer sleek, classic packaging and this packaging has a funky look but definitely not a deal breaker. I would buy this again and again. The only reason I took 1 star off is because the pencil sometimes is hard to get the color to transfer on my eyebrows.",1
"I recieved this for free to review from Influenster.  I was kind of scared to try this because I thought it would make my face peel but it didn't.  It gave my skin a more even skin tone, made my face feel soft and smooth and also dried out breakouts.",1
"I recieved this foundation for free from Influenster for the sole purpose to give an honest review. The foundation did create a flawless complexion!  It truly felt light weight on my skin.  For me it was too matte.  I had a dry patch and it emphasized.  In addition,  the SPF 35 made me break out.  Definitely would try the glow foundation if you have any dry patches.",3
"I recieved this foundation from Influenster at no charge to review.  I have to say, when I got notification that I'd be receiving it I was over the moon excited! I've never used Dior make-up before. I was pleased with the bottle and pump, very sleek looking. The foundation came out creamy in texture and had virtually no scent to it. I used a brush to apply it. it went on well and had nice coverage and the color (W2) matched my skin beautifully. The only draw back is I have SUPER dry skin and this seemed to settle into my fine lines very quickly, making my skin look even drier. Overall, I do like this foundation, I just use a heavier moisturizer with it and a solid primer.",4
"I recieved this from Influenster in exchange for my review - and thank goodness. I love serums my current favorite is $58, this one is $20 bucks cheaper, woo hoo.\nIt absorbs quickly and is very hydrating. it's not oily or heavy which is a must for me.",4
"I recieved this from Influenster to sample, my sensitive skin is loving this serum. My skin feels softer since adding this step to my morning routine. I can see myself buying this  after its empty. I feel it's worth the price.",2
*i recieved this in influenster* I have combo skin. I had high hopes for this because I love for glow however it just made me look oily! I hate the sprayer it's too weak. I felt that the mist did a good job of setting my makeup but after a while it just got so oily. I'm not naturally a very oily person so I did not like that at all. maybe for really dry skin for hydration.,4
"I recieved this in one of Tatcha's mini sets. This was by far my favorite product. The way this foams up feels so luxurious because it doesn't over foam and get in your eyes and nose. It's an absolute pleasure to use and is one of the only cleansers I've tried so far that doesn't make my face feel tight after patting dry. I took off one star because of the price. Unfortunately, that's why I will not repurchase. I can not bring myself to spend so much on a cleanser.",0
I recieved this item free from influenster for testing purposes. The palette's shimmer shadows were probably the best from the pallette. yet still not as strong as huda even when useing just my fingers. The darkest eyeshadow on the pallette was a bit tough to blend. might just be me but it seemed patchy. overall great to use for a natural/slight glittery look.,1
I recieved this item with my PLAY box and used it everynight by itself for about a week and it worked great!\nI paired it with my neutrogena gel cream and the combination irritated my skin and raised a little rash! \nIt went away once i washed my face but just be careful! Luckily my husband noticed it and  i washed my face right away.,1
"I recieved this kit for free to try, and I'm really enjoying it! I've used, and loved, each of the included items, with the cleanser being my overall favorite.  The items come in a super cute case that I'll be able to use to carry items for travel. I'll definitely be purchasing in the future!",3
I recieved this powder free in exchange for review. this product is beautiful. it was complimentary when it went over my make up. didnt cast a white shadow. I used a brush to apply it under my eyes and in my t zone.  this helped make my Makeup last longer with out my oils shining through and causing the makeup to slide around.,1
"I recieved this product as a free sample for testing purposes and omg I need to get my hands on some, this mask left my face feeling so clean and firm which is literally my favorite part of face masks! P.s sorry I didn't draw on my brows lol",0
"I recieved this product as a free sample, this is make my lashes look long, the best mascara I had in long time, especially great with primer, my lashes look like I did it in salon. 5 stars. I recieved it free for a review",2
I recieved this product complimentary for review from influenster and I'm so glad I did! I notice a difference after one nights application. my skin is noticeably more hydrated and plump in the morning,4
"**I recieved this product complimentary for review ** I have really been enjoying this product. It comes in little tubes of 10 tablets which makes it so portable and easy to throw in your bag so you'll never forget to take them. The first time I tried this I dropped a tablet Into a full bottle of water and did not enjoy the taste at all but I tried it the second time with half a bottle and it tasted much better. I don't know of I would call it strawberry lemonade but it's not bad. I've almost used a 30 day supply so far and I have noticed that my skin looks more evenly toned. The texture and size of my pores looks smoother as well. I do recommend this product, you can never get enough vitamin c, it's easy to take and easy to remember to take!",1
"I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster! I adore the OG Primer Oil, it is definitely HG. This new Mindful 5 Nourishing Primer Serum is awesome. It leaves the skin feeling plump, soft & smooth. It is the perfect product for before makeup or alone.",1
I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster I'm on week 2 of using this as the directions say to one pump smooth around the eye area..and I love it! It takes a little longer to asorb then the face cream but not to long. It works ladies. I can tell my fine lines are disappearing and darkness is fading already! My kids can even see the difference.Its a keeper forsure. I was surprised of the price..but like I said it does exactly what it says it will if used as directed.,2
I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. I've been using it as the instructions say to witch is using 1 or 2 pumps apply to face twice a day I use 2 pumps 2x a day and I love it! It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I have noticed my skin is alot smoother and feels firmer. I really knew it was already working because my kids asked if I was wearing makeup..lol..and no I have not been..I've only been using my Obagi Clinical creams thank you Influenster for giving me a chance to try this product it's great! I was surprised of the price but if it's already making a difference in a weeks time I wonder if it'll keep or surpass what it has done so far..I would purchase this. It does work,2
"I recieved this product for free for testing purposes from influenster. I honestly really love this product! I've had dry skin lately around my t zone and this had worked wonders. I've been using for about 2 weeks and even though the price is a little high, I think I would purchase this myself when I run out. The packaging is adorable and it will last me a while, one pump covers my whole face. I'm eager to try more of their products!",4
"I recieved this product from Influenster for an honest review. I was excited to receive this product. I have dry skin an often struggle with finding a good concealer that actually works for me. unfortunately this was not a winner for me. My under eyes looked cakey despite the careless claims. The formula is too dry for me. I imagine if you love shape tape you will also love this product. I am sad this didn""t work for me but I believe it's my skin not so much the product.",2
"I recieved this product from Influenster. I use high end serums regularly. I enjoy the texture of this product; the scent does not bother me. It does seem to soften and brighten the skin. However, I'm not sure about the tightening claim.",4
"I recieved this product with the DE set: The Littles, but this one was a miss for me. It would make my under eye area sting, especially if I used it after my AHA lotion at night. it's like DE wants you to use exclusively only their products for best results but I don't have the money for that. This product kept stinging under my eyes so it's a no for me",1
"I regularly use Fresh sugar lip treatments, so I thought I'd give this a try. Love the subtle mint scent to this! I don't think it has a plumping effect, but there is a tingling feeling when I put it on. \nIt's moisturizing like all the other sugar lip treatment products. Definitely will buy again!",0
"I remember when I bought this product, I was travelling in Montreal, it was a really unexpected hot and sunny day. I stopped by at sephora, found this amazing thing. I remember being in the car, on my way back home, having a large sunburn on my chest, so I decided to use it right away. BEST IDEA EVER! This product was amazing, had an amazing smell, and helped the burn to cool down (which was a really good feeling).",0
"I returned this product. It's fine, but I wanted slightly more coverage than my tinted moisturizer, and this was just as light. That's probably good for some but not what I wanted. Also, I like to mix an enhancer drop into my moisturizer/foundation, and because of the roller ball, this just wasn't a convenient way to dispense the product for my purposes.",3
"I revived this product complimentary to try from Influenster.  I am really picky with my mascara, and I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It applied nicely and didn't clump. I liked the brush. It's stayed on all day without smudging, even in the rain. And it didn't irritate my eyes and all and I usually have that problem with a lot of mascaras. I quite liked this one!",1
"I said that I wasn't going to buy this palette but I'm so glad that I did. It's so pigmented, deep, dark and delicious. It's also very Black girl friendly, not an ashy tone in the palette. If anything, it's the opposite, pure color saturation. I've purchase from Melt before and this and the Smoke Sessions palette are by far, the best!!!",4
I sampled these in store and am not a fan of the scents and they are so small. I wish some of you reviewers would stop leaving reviews that things smell like old ladies. First of all its not a description and secondly its offensive.,3
"I saw a lot of bad reviews about this product but decided to try it any way and i am happy that I did. I have hooded eyes and so my eyeshadow creases very easily and almost always if I dont use a primer. I have worn this for over 8 hours with no creasing. I also love the pigments, a little goes a long way with this pallet which is great. I have had other pallets where you have to try so hard just to put a little on. I love the quality, the mix of shadows and mascara/liner and I love the box. minus the weird beads on top lol",4
I saw JACKIE AINA using a  KAT brush to set under her eyes and forehead and I thought this was the brush and it was on sale so I got it. but turns out its not the brush she was using but its a GREAT under the eye setting brush and touch up brush I love it and so glad I have it.,0
I saw the Instagram video for this product and decided to try it on whim and I couldn't be happier with it. I often wear this product alone and it works wonder to brighten up my under eyes. Looks flawless and natural.,1
"I saw the mixed reviews here and wasn't sure if this would work. I have some deep lines under my eye area and need a heavier cream to help them. However, I usually end up with milia under my eye because of the heavy creams. Imagine my surprise after using this cream for a month and my milia have disappeared! My deep lines are fine lines and my eye area looks brighter I didn't realize it was even dark until this cream. Everyone's skin is different, but this really made a difference for my dry-as-the-Sahara under eye area. For me it's been so hard to find the right eye cream and now I've found it!  This is my new holy grail eye cream.  Thank you so much to the sales associate that introduced this to me!!",1
"I saw this on an influencer's YouTube channel, and thought it would give it a whirl. I have purchased Charlotte Tilbury products in the past, and have been pleased.\nThis mascara is fairly pricey- more than what I normally pay, and I am also a die hard Benefit Roller lash fan- but I was feeling a bit sassy, and took a chance.\nupon opening the box, the packaging is nice; it is a weighty, gold tube that feels high end. upon opening the product, I could see right away that the mascara is thick- moreso than L'Oreal Lash Paradise. I had to wipe a good amount off on a cloth before application, else I was going to have a big mess. \nPrior to application, I noticed that the brush/applicator had a bristle that was longer than the rest- if I hadn't seen it prior to applying the mascara, I could have poked my eye, which would have been really irritating. I will have to cut it, later.\nOnce applied, the product is thick and very black. I can see that this would definitely make for some 'bold' lashes, but I decided to just apply one coat, and that was after I wiped a lot of product off on a cloth. I waited for it to dry, but man- this stuff takes FOREVER. I was constantly having to clean up spots where the tils of my lashes hit my lids. It took probably a good 5 minutes to dry down. \nAfter dry down, my lashes do look nice- they are more prominent and appear thicker, without being 'spidery'. \nOverall, I am unsure if I will repurchase; it is pricey, wet and I end up wasting a good amount of product, just wiping it off to get a conservative coverage.  \nProbably will stay with my tried and true.",2
"I saw this palette and just had to have it. The color story is beautiful. It is so unlike anything that I have in my collection of eye palettes that I just had to have it. I purchased it release day at my local sephora and I haven't been able to try ALLof the beautifully pigmented colors. I have been able to play around with about 1/3 of them, both the mattes and shimmers alike. This is the first palette that I have purchased from Huda Beauty, and while a do have a quite a few other of her products that I love there has always been something that just wasn't there for me in her palettes. But I have found that this one blends well, the mattes are not chalky, the glitters stay well put and all blend well. Overall very nicely done!",1
I see no difference to this and what is offered generic at the drugstore.  The ingredients are nothing to write home about and the effect as any other peel off mask is also the same - pretty much nil - I am not impressed.  This was a waste of thirty minutes.,1
"#ISeeVioletC\xa0#VioletCAndMe\nI recieved this product compliment from Influenser and o couldnt have been more excited to try it out ! of course, with any product for your skin it took some time to start changing my skin but now that it has? the texture and the smoothness of my skin has DEFINITELY changed for the better. This product has really grown on my opinion the longer I use it.",0
"I selected the shade 1.5N as I have fair to medium skin. When the foundation arrived I was sure it would be too light for me, but once I applied it it blended in beautifully. I have several foundations that I normally rotate in use, however, since I received this foundation two weeks ago it I have used it exclusively. I like to apply my foundation using a brush, over a primer, and followed by concealer. I find the coverage of this foundation to be moderate, but easily buildable. I have been experimenting with not using powder on my face as I've found it to worsen the appearance of fine lines on my face, and without powder this foundation has a lovely, satin, and skin like finish to it. It does exactly what I want a foundation to do, it improves the appearance of my skin and evens out my skin tone while still looking natural, never cakey. The product feels light and comfortable on my skin and lasts all day. This has quickly become my favorite foundation and I absolutely plan to repurchase it once I run out. I received this foundation for free from Influenster for testing.",4
i should have wrote this a whole ago considering that i been using it for a while but it works really well. Especially when you set it with airspun powder. my shadow doesn't crease anymore and I make sure sure to put it on the crease and rub it on the whole eyelid.,4
"I should've read the description better, I would've never purchased this. for some reason I thought the pom pom would open revealing access to the makeup so that I could apply it in a reasonable way. Instead I have to slam this dumb plush against me to try to get product to dispense. I'll probably throw it away if I don't get to returning it.",1
"I simply  love this blush. Beautiful color, blends easily and seems  to  be  the  perfect  shade  for  my light complexion. Every time I've worn  it I get compliments! At my age that is a wonderful  thing.",4
"I sincerely hope that people notice that when you buy the full size, you're actually paying $12.00 more for nothing. two of the mini sizes make up one full size. You'll end up paying $30.00 instead. This is a bizarre reversal of sizing up for value.",4
"Is it just me or does this smell like fruit loops, used it on my face after shaving and I loved it. it didn't dry my face out like I've found other face cleaners too do, the smell and the way it made my face feel earned this review. will restock in the larger size :)",0
"I smell Grandma! Where is she? Oh that's right- on my face! I couldn't get over the smell of this. It lingered for hours. If you're into the rose scent, you'd probably like it. I thought it was ""just ok"" as a moisturizer. I need something a little more heavy (my favorite by far is IT-confidence in a cream. I also like Algenist Collagen cream). After a few hours my face was dried out. I will say I have VERY dry skin though. Pass for me.",4
I snapped Salted Caramel up when it was $5 and am so glad I did. It's described as a burnt orange but it throws warm nude on me. It is not a scary neon or anything like that. It's beautiful and sheer with enough color to even my lips out. \nIt smells faintly of coffee. I don't mind the scent.\nThe texture is slightly sticky. It's thicker than Fenty Gloss Bomb and all of my Two Faced lip glosses. Staying power is just ok.,0
"Is not that I don't like the pallette, it's just that I thought the bronzers wouldn't be so shiny, since I prefer matte bronzers. Highlights are gorgeous and the blush I like most is the coral/peach one. The rose one has glitter in it, so I rarely use it. I would recommend this pallette if you like the waaaaaay too glowing look.",2
"I so looked forward to receiving this product but when I got it, it had come off it's base and was smashed into the top of the cover. I should have sent it right back but I was headed out immediately on a trip and I wanted to make it work...you know how it is. I tried to push it back in and it sort of functioned. Off I went. OK. However... the color was not what I had expected - it was more of an orange brown, and I can't say as it gave me any glow no matter where I applied it. It felt waxy. I also didn't enjoy the scent. Boo/hiss. I am a HUGE fan of the Magic Cream - multiple purchases of that. The LARGE jar. I credit it with calming my sensitive, breakouty, rosacea-prone skin right down. But this? Paaass.",3
I so wish I could return this. It has no staying power at all. Very sheer to begin with and stays maybe 15 minutes. Plumping... Not really. This stuff is a joke packaged under the Dior name. Shame on you.,2
I splurged on Dark Matte (DM) and Editorial Brights (EB) Palettes after researching numerous times. My intention was to use DM more as this palette seemed more practical and will go with anything and everything in most of our collection and use EB as an experiment to color. One year later... my palettes look messy and crumbly after depotting them but I never expect that I used more colours from the EB than DM. I used these bright colours mostly on my lashlines to the outer corners and these colours stay on beautifully for more than 8hr. I would recommend the EB palette more to someone who owns a lot of neutral and dark palettes.,0
I started having noticeable dryness under my eyes and makeup made it more pronounced. I decided to get this after reading reviews and now there’s no more dryness and makeup goes on so much smoother. I even noticed my dark circles are gone. I just use a small dab under each eye and dab it lightly. I use it at night and within a week I noticed the improvement. This will last a long time too since you don’t need much,2
"I started suffering from dry eyes. My eye doctor said the ducts that release lipids into tears were blocked. She recommended I start taking an omega 3 product. As I already love many other Hum products I immediately  chose this omega 3 to try. It is too soon to see an improvement with my eyes but my skin looks phenomenal and I have had no adverse reaction, not even a gross fish taste.",3
"I started using Secret Sauce face cream about 6 weeks ago.  I wanted to give it solid try before letting people know what I thought about.  I’m 57 and was looking for a really good moisturizer for my “mature” skin.  Well, I have found it.  The cream itself is silky feeling.  It does not have a fragrance (which I appreciate.). When I put it on it absorbs quickly without a heavy greasy feeling.  I do have to say, my skin is smoother, fresher, and not near as dry as before I started using this moisturizer.  I HAVE noticed a difference!",3
"I started using the drunk Elephant line last year and can say, without a doubt,  it has transformed my skin!  I have very oily skin and was hesitant to use any face oil.  of course I started using the rest of the line, retinol/acids,  and figured it was best to use an oil so I don't end up with dry spots all over.  I love this stuff!  initially I applied way to much and of course the majority of it just sat on top of my skin.  I was so bummed and assumed it wasn't going to soak in to my oily face. The next night I gave it another go and used half the dropper and omg that made all the difference!  it soaked into my skin, felt great, and I woke up with super soft skin!  Def worth the $$ !",2
"I started using this after trying the eye cream of the same line (amazing too). the facial cream is extremely moisturing, it goes well on top of any serum or skin care products. a little pea size product goes a long way. it served as a barrier to preserve whatever I have under (serum..etc). my face stays moisturized throughout the day. over time, my skin became glowing and just healthier in general.\n\ni saw some reviews stating that this could cause greasiness, which is true, if you put too much on your face. I accidentally did it once, even though it was greasy at first, the skin absorbed the product overtime. \n\nit is expensive, but I have been using the same jar for months (because you really don't need much each time).",2
"I started using this and The Ordinary's 'Buffet' at the same time, and the combo is pure magic. My skin is so soft, plump, and hydrated! I've gone through this pretty quickly since I love to drench my skin in the fine mist, multiple times a day. I plan on repurchasing, direct from Tata Harper, since they offer the larger size and Sephora does not..",0
I started using this serum to replace my previous go-to: PTR Truth Serum. I wanted something that still had the Vitamin C and brightening effect so I tried this. Okay so I don't love the pineapple scent but it's still a really great serum. I use it in my daytime routine after my toner. The texture of it is like a really thin jelly. I use about 2-3 drops and it leaves my skin glowing and smooth. I like the addition of AHA because my skin does well with exfoliants. I also find that I can follow up with much less moisturizer because of how well my skin drinks after using this. I love the glow effect so much that I don't want to apply makeup afterwards! I really would appreciate a revamped version with an improved scent but again I'm not super sensitive about that. Especially since the serum works great.,2
"I started with the ever famous ""skinny dip"" ...and well, I'm hooked. These live up to the hype!!! love the smell/taste/sticky factor, and most of all shade range. I ordered 2 in the sale sea glass - LOVE!!! And a purple one (um, shoot- forget the name) it went back, a little too intense for me. but Sea Glass, oh, she is P-R-E-E-T-T-Y!!",3
"Is this an overpriced, bougie water spray? Sure is! But does it hydrate your skin with no residue or smell? Sure does! I love this spray to refresh my makeup, wet my brushes and cool me down. I keep one in the fridge as well! If you're a lady of a certain age like myself, hot flashes are totally a part of life. When I feel one starting, I'll grab this spray out of my fridge and spray the back of my neck. It stops the hot flash as well as it feels AMAZING!!! That alone makes me a repeat customer!",2
"Is this worth the price? YES. The mist on this thing is so fine, it makes me wish it was refillable. I would love to put all my setting sprays in this container because it is divine. The product itself smells like a jolly rancher in the best way possible. It leaves my skin looking hydrated and it melts my powders in but it doesn't make me super dewy in the way the tatcha dewy skin mist does. I love this for the summer time when my skin is more on the normal side and it's so much cheaper than tatcha. I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out",0
"I still remember the first time I bought this product at a Bobbi Brown makeup counter almost 8 years ago. How did I go without it for so long? This was a godsend when I was staying up late for university exams, and I repurchased it recently because I've been getting darker under eyes and I am in LOVE all over again. It is creamy, it doesn't crease, and it covers EVERYTHING. I am all about light coverage foundations and more serum-like concealers and this doesn't look too overdone with these light products. I will definitely continue to repurchase this when I run out. I never want to be without it again.",0
"I stopped by the Marc Jacob's section and saw all the new glosses.  I really loved all the colors, but this one really grabbed me.  The color is really pretty on and it doesn't feel sticky on the lips.  I am trying to wear more pinks, so this was a good way to try it.  I would definitely get this color again.",3
"I struggled for what felt like years to find a liner that applied nicely, didn't try out in a month and lasted after application. This definitely isn't as waterproof as some products (it was all over my face when my SIL got engaged), but it is definitely my new favourite liner. Easiest application for a liquid I've come across!",4
I suffer from very dry skin specially now in the winter. after trying this for a few weeks I can honestly say WOW! my skin has never felt and looked this hydrated and smooth! I received these complimentary to try and after this bottle Im so impressed,1
"I suppose we are all entitled to our OPINIONS. I live this set. I have another ""mini"" set with a highlighter and it is also perfect. These are small, they are pigmented, yes they are nude colors so if you aren't into that don't buy this! I love this set totally happy purchase and next I'm going for a blush!",3
I switched to this corrector and I'm glad I did. it doesn't take a lot of product to get results. it's tremendous at covering dark blemishes or blue hues from 5 o clock shadow. my skin looked flawless.,2
"I switched to this foundation from Estee Lauder double wear (I was shade 2W2 rattan in that foundation) and I am so glad I switched. While the double wear is much more full coverage compared to this, I find it is also far cakier and can look unnatural at times. This foundation is a much better substitute for everyday wear to work makeup (as long as you don’t overdo it) and has a nice satin like finish rather than being completely matte like the double wear. With that being said, it does require more foundation to build up to the same level of coverage as double wear provides. But I see this as a great flexibility/versatility because I have never felt too cakey when wearing this foundation. It works really well with the LM translucent setting powder as well. Using these two products in unison has been great for me as I find my makeup looks best when I do. However, I have used this foundation with the too faced peach loose setting powder and Shiseido pressed translucent setting powder and it holds beautifully with those as well. Great for medium to build-able full coverage and love the finish. Highly recommend!",0
"It absolutely does not hydrate or plump my lips. I only have the shade Malibu so I don't know if this runs true for the other shades, but Malibu looks shiny in a metallic way. It doesn't look like a balm or traditional gloss on me. And if my lips are dry to begin with, this formula actually makes my lips feel dryer. I love the whole message behind the brand but honestly this is overpriced for something that doesn't work as claimed.",2
"it absorbed quickly into my skin and left me feeling fresh for hours. It also reduced a lot of my itchy spots which are super dry. Ive also noticed less oiliness on my skin after a week of using Ceramidin Liquid, it feels normal through most of the day. I've never been more happy with my purchase once I started using  Ceramidin Liquid. I'll definitely repurchase!",1
"It burns as soon as it made skin contact! However, that was the only downside. It didn't leave me glowing red as many products do with heavy chemicals and scents do, was a good exfoliator, it had no scent, made my skin smooth and soft & doesn't feel like it leaves a residue like many masks can.",1
It caused my entire eye area to dry out severely and flake after I'd been using it for a few weeks. It took me awhile to figure out that this was the cause. It was very painful and took weeks to heal after I stopped using this product.,1
it covered great. I put it on all over even under my eyes.....put powder over or around my eyes and my stay in place eyeliner made me look like I had black eyes. I tried diff eyeliners and the kosas was to oily for me.,3
"It covers dark circles, redness, uneven  skin tone, you name it . the rich formula  does not get cakey under the eye which is very hard to find ! you only need a small amount and wow the coverage it provides!  I love the pigment and how easily it blends. This mini will last a long time. However, I did notice that the concealer worked much better with some primers than others. If you try it and do not like it, give it a chance - try playing around with different products you apply beforehand (creams , oils , primers , etc) and trust me, once you find a match you'll love it too.",1
"It definitely took away the red, but I had to use a small amount, otherwise, it made my face grey. I would not recommend this to people with warm skin tones. I will keep this to treat small areas (around the nose) but not for my entire face.",1
"It didn't work at all, packaging is pretty bad (product gets in the lid) and the product came 25% empty. I tried to return it after 2 weeks of trying to make it work but because it came so empty they thought I had already used half the product. It felt nice on my skin but didn't help with the dark circles.",0
"It did seem calming and cooling to the skin. However, it left a film that didn't feel great after, and didn't play well under my makeup. I don't think I will use regularly or repurchase, but will keep it on hand for when my skin is very irritated.",2
It does have a strong scent at first but once it is applied I can't smell it at all. It's easy to apply and feels really good on. I like applying it before bed but I've also liked it as a makeup primer.,1
"It doesn't...""wow"" me, for lack of a better term. it works, but I dont find that it covers anything before my shadow, which is something I was hoping for. My eyeshadow stays on, but not more than with my foundation or concealer applied in its place. \n\nOne small personal thing to add: when I'm impatient and try to apply my shadows onto it without letting it dry for a bit, it gets all over my crease brush (totally on me). But sometimes waiting doesn't help it dry out at all. Part of that is due to the fact that I have hooded eyelids that prevent it from drying, so keep that in mind.\nI just dont know if I see any huge difference. I'll try it with some glittery/metallic shadows to see if it works well for topping my eyeshadow base with, but I honestly feel that it can make my eyeshadow look patchy and muddy.",0
"It does what it claims. Brightens your under eye, but it is best to not use too much of it. I have seen that it applies better with my fingers since the warmth helps it blend seamlessly. I top it off with a little bit of the Armani Beauty High Precision Retouch concealer and then set it with the Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder for Under Eyes or the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Ethereal Light and it has been a dream team. I have used it without setting powder and it lasts a good while but of course not as much as with powder. I have used up a whole little pot (lasted me over a year and a half of almost daily use), didn't repurchase it thinking there was something better out there. I was so wrong! I had to repurchase it and then questioned myself why I waited so long (couple of months trying others but none came close).",0
It does what it says it does! Great for moisturizing without the oily residue or stickiness oils and other creams leave. It is not targeted for black circles. It moisturizes and fills in the dry lines and makes any makeup look flawless the next morning.,0
"It does work pretty well on beauty blenders. You do have to put some work into it, but it is worth it. it gets most of the sponge completely clean. the stubborn spots won't come off well. I would buy it again.",1
"I tend to have very dry skin in the eye area and have issues with dark circles and am starting to see fine lines form. I bought this mainly to combat dryness. It does a decent job. I did, however, notice that when rubbing it in, it turns into a very watery texture and tends to slide all over. It didn't affect any makeup application so long as it was completely dry and didn't bother my eyes. The dramatic change in texture is just super off-putting for me. I feel like there are much better products out there for a similar price. That being said, I won't be repurchasing it.",0
"I test a lot of products.  I'm still looking for my HG products for several steps in my skincare routine. Trouble is, my skin is highly reactive so I often end up with a rash about 2 weeks after starting a product.  This cleanser is one I turn to when my skin is in that state.  It doesn't worsen the reaction/rash/ eczema or whatever state it's in and it may even soothe the situation a bit.\nI don't feel like it does much more than that (not that that's a small thing), though.  It claims to brighten and exfoliate as well as help with uneven texture.  I don't feel like it does any of that.  It looks a bit shiny when you squeeze it out of the tube, but that's as close as it gets to brightening.   A good thing to have when my skin gets angry, but I'm looking for more in a cleanser.",3
It feels very fine... So fine it is impossible to get that BECCA glow. Even when building and building it is still very unnoticeable unlike a few swipes of BECCA. It oddly looks like hints of glitter after spending the time to build for this product to even be mildly noticeable. I hate glitter,1
It greatly improved redness from past acne. I've had some congestion in my pores and I'm not sure if it caused it. I didnt notice a difference in moisture level.  since I like the decreased redness so much I'm continuing to use it.,0
"It has great coverage, but feels light and blends so well.  It's neither matte or shiny...just right.  I feel so happy just gliding some on and blending it in.  It's my only go to and I've been looking for a new product for years.",3
It hasn't done anything for my skin. It is like spraying perfume on your face.  It does have the tendency to burn if I have used adapalene or benzyl peroxide the day before.  I was using it to add extra moisture to my face but my skin still feels super tight and dry after using this.  The smell is nice and doesn't linger but I just can't see myself buying another bottle.,1
"It has zero color pay off. Just your typical run of the mill lip gloss, very goopy, thick consistency, seems very heavy on your lips. It was my first time trying Fenty product, and sadly regret purchasing it. I don't understand the hype. Very disappointing!!",2
"I think for those complaining about application, y'all might be complicating what's supposed to be effortless. I just use my finger to slap these bad boys on, no problem. combine two colors? use two fingers, whatever. they didn't crease on my hooded eyes and so much pigment! lasted a long time and easy to apply. a little goes a long way.",1
I think I like Glow even better than Fu$$y! It's a mesmerizing shimmery rose nude. It's sheer but adds that oomph. That final touch that takes a look from good to can't-stop-staring.\n\nHard to describe but Ri Ri steady killed it. Some say Fu$$y and Fenty Glow are too similar to own both. But that depends on how pigmented your lips are. Mine are a flushed berry color that I usually try to lighten up. But Gloss Bomb makes me happy with what I have! It evens out and glows up.,0
i think its good for the price theyre all very expensive products and honestly you dont need much of each so they last really long especially if you incorporate them with what you already have. The serums and moisturizers feel so good and fresh!,1
"I think Sephora dropped the ball this year.  I've been buying Skin Wonderland and this year was a true disappointment.  The products were so small.  There was a lot of filler paper in a huge box but the actual products were really tiny.  Like others, I bought the box this year because of the La Mer Soft Cream, but it still doesn't worth the price.  I'm giving two stars just for the La Mer Soft Cream.",3
I think the quality is amazing but the size of the brushes are smaller than I thought they would be which is why you're losing one star. They look bigger online then they actually are in person but they're nice either way and I love that they have weight to them! However I'm a bit annoyed at the fact that there is glue stuck on the end of each brush that's not easy to get off. I just spent 5 minutes scrubbing the glue off of one of them and now the end of my brush is completely scratched up! I don't know who thought it was a good idea to glue them into the box but I would have much rather had them come in the nice brush clutch that came with the brushes. While it's a beautiful presentation the glue has ruined it:(,2
I think this brush is alright. I'm not sure I'd buy it again when it comes to replacing the brush only because of the price... I cant justify it. I use this brush with the original powder foundation n it applies great. just too pricey.,0
"I think this curler it less curled than what I normally use.  I have asian eyes so it does pinch my lid when I try to curl my lashes so I have to be very careful on how I place the curler.  When I get it in the right placement it curls good, but who wants to work that hard to try to get curled lashes especially in a hurry? In my opinion it is not made for all eye shapes without the struggle of trying to not pinch your lid.  I use a Revlon curler that is curled and I have never pinched myself using it.",4
"I think this does work to help with puffiness and darkness but it's not very hydrating, in the morning it's fine under makeup but at night I still apply another eye cream over it. I do like it alot and will repurchase for sure",3
"I think this is an amazing product - but it is not something to turn to if you have only a minute to get out of the house! i read the directions and also to talked to a savvy Sephora adviser. It is essential to use a tiny amount of product and apply it over the entire face. Done right, it creates a smooth and lovely appearance. Sometimes I am able to skip foundation and go out with this primer over my usual sunblock. What's not to love about that??",4
"I think this is the best for cleaning the beauty blender sponges.  Easy to use, and smells good.  I always saturate the sponge with warm water, and then squirt some of the liquid onto it.  The nozzle never touches the sponge to cause cross-contamination, as some have reported.  Although it cleans well enough, it still doesn't get every trace of makeup out, especially the long-wearing type foundations, no matter how many times I wash it.  And because I don't feel the sponge is completely clean, and just good enough for a few more applications, I tend to replace them more often than I would like to.  I'm hoping they will eventually come up with a cleaner or formula that will also remove the long-wearing foundations.",3
"I think this is the best thing since sliced bread.I have been looking for a volumizing mascara that doesn't clump, flake or smear. I also love that my lashes aren't crunchy after application. It is super black and I get tremendous volume with one swipe. I will definitely continue to purchase this mascara.",3
"I think this night cream is wonderful. The negativity from some reviewers is perhaps because it's not exactly suited to younger skin, and not oily types. For older and/or dry skin, and for people living where the seasons change, I think it's appropriate. The fruity scent is a treat, IMO!",3
I thought it would be nice to have since I bought the full size Naked Honey. I loved this set way more then I thought I would. I agree with the previous review that this mini palette is nicer then the full size palette! I will be purchasing a back-up!,4
"I thought I was gonna returned it after my first application bcs of the liquidity consistency; I wasn't sure how to blend it out. It also wasn't as taupe as i thought it would be. But after applying it with my ring finger at the corner of my eyes and added other eye shadow on my crease, it actually turned into a beautiful highlighter. It is true that the color wasn't what I intended to buy, but i love this for other purpose now and i have been wearing it every day since!",2
"I thought the champagne color was pretty at first glance, but it applied pretty unevenly and gave my eyes a splotchy, messy, glittery look. It's one of the worse shadows I've ever bought and have tried this multiple times with the same results.",4
I thought this product was okay. the pigmentation isnt what I prefer I really had to pack on product for it not to look patchy. I also wish that there was a transition color. it could be a staple on the go palette with one or two transition shades,1
I thought this was a good buy. The products are newer. The Milk cool gel works pretty well for puffiness but I used it for fine lines too. The Farsalì glass smooths the look of skin and poors really well. The Natasha Denona I don't recommend as more than a topper unless you are naturally flushed. They are nice toppers. The Kaja is okay. It doesn't blend well on me but it's probably a teens dream and cute concept.The Violet Voss blends well and stays put. The Melt lipstick stays put and is very comfortable. The color is nice. Should fit most. The Artist Couture works to sprinkle glitter everywhere but not a lone shadow or glitter shadow. Anywhere you want sparkles.,3
"It is a bit more runny than I would care for so I sometime get some on my teeth, but it dries into a velvety matte. With a beautifully rich color. I only go over my lips once. For the matte finish, it is NOT drying - which I love!",1
It is an amazing winter color and it gets darker after putting it on so give it a minute after putting it on and you'll love the color. It gives an edgier look and is not as drying as other matte lipsticks.,4
"It is creamy, easy to apply with a dense foundation brush, and feels weightless. I do notice that it sticks to the dry patches on my skin, but that's probably just my fault. It breaks up throughout the day on my cheeks even though I set it with powder. It also gets used up way too fast. I probably wouldn't repurchase because of the price but it might be better if you take the time to use a primer, powder, and setting spray.",0
"It is good, and for the price decent, but I did not love it. It flaked off in the corner after a day of wear, which my $3 Essense eyeliner did not do. That being said, the brush is amazing and so easy to get a sharp cateye. I personally would reccomend it to someone looking for a nice sharp line but who doesn't mind a shorter wear and is on a budget. Personally I will not repurchase, my new liner is the Fenty one, which knocks this out of the park.",0
"it is not a bad product but the price? I think I was expecting something special - I like Bobbi Brown in general but if you are looking for a good lip conditioner, order La Neige for a fraction of the price.",3
"It is pretty good, nothing earth shattering for mature eyes. I can see this being great for the 20-30 crowd.This one does work pretty well on upper lids.   I prefer the Shiseido ones for the under eyes.",3
"It is SO HARD to find a blush that actually stays on all day. I think this might be the one! The shade is not perfect for me, but I really like it anyway. @bareminerals products are always easy to use and work well for a minimalist like me. Loving #BounceWithBare and this #contest to try this product for free.",1
"It is super easy to use and not messy. It applies very smoothly, the consistency isn't gooey or watery and washes off easily. It dries pretty quickly and I felt a light tingle sensation. I did notice my face looked brighter and felt tighter.I personally use this product for my T-zone 3 times a week. I am hesitant to say that it reduced my pores significantly but it did so a little bit. My only complain I have is its price for its limited applications. I recommend this produce but not if you have very dry skin.",4
"It is unbelievable how much this has transformed my skin,  I use this with the Dennis Gross retinol eye serum and some Biossance product and this is the absolute best my skin has ever looked.  I was recently using Drunk elephant retinol and it was ok, the results were nothing compared to this for my 40 year old face. I will never use anything else again!",4
"It is very hard to find the right bronzer when you have dark skin and Fenty killed it. This mocha mami bronzer is perfect for deep skin. Im 450 in the fenty foundation for reference. I like this bronzer because it adds a warmth to my skin. I especially like it for days I'm not going to wear a lot of makeup because it's great for a natural look. I recommend going to the Fenty website and watching the tutorial where the makeup artist uses this on a dark skinned model, it will give you ideas as to how to use it. Even if you don't have dark skin, he also shows you how to use it on fair skin and medium skin  so it's great for everyone to check out. This bronzer is versatile because it's also great for days I'm going for a glam look or full face. I also love to use it when I make a mistake and put on too much blush or highlight. I just put the bronzer over it and it takes away all that extra shine so it's great to correct errors. It also fixes other errors too, like when your foundation turns out more chalky or ashy than you expected for whatever reason but you don't want to start all over. This bronzer cools down your face and takes away that ashyness. This is one of those purchases where you feel completely satisfied and happy with it because it exceeded your expectations.",2
"It is very unfortunate to say but I couldn’t use my device since it came broken and one of the little metal ball would easily fall off every time. \nAlso, I did not know that but my skin is hiper sensitive and I couldn’t handle the little shocks on my face. \nI had high hopes but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. \nPackaging is very nice and device seems very easy to use though.",0
"It is very waxy, creates patches on my lips and color is a pink shade instead of warm tan. It makes my lips dry though I don't suffer from dry lips. A balm should lock in moisture, however, this does the opposite. I would return it.",1
"It leaves a slight white cast on my face  and leaves me with white looking eyebrows. I usually try to flake off the reside in my eyebrows with a comb. This is great for no-makeup days but when i try layering my tarte makeup primer over it, the sunscreen starts to flake off. However, it does what it is meant to do. Will not repurchase.",1
"It looked and worked great testing it on the back of my hand, but it was barely coming out at all trying to use it on my eyes. It wasn't coming out at all, no matter how many times I went over it. It doesn't even work on the back of my hand anymore unless I press down on the thick end of the brush at the base; even pressing down, no product will come out of the tip of the brush.",0
It may not cover big blemishes like zits but it does even out your skin tone. I love how it's so sheer and feels light but still gives some coverage. It's really easy to apply and is my go-to when I need to rush out of the house.,0
"It might work well with conventional nail polishes, but I had a terrible time removing Dazzle Dry polish with this.  For those who don't know, DD is a hybrid polish that acts like a gel but comes off with regular polish remover.  After working on one nail for a while and getting nowhere, I pulled out my Sephora polish remover and voilà!  Sephora doesn't sell their polish remover anymore so I suppose I'll have to keep looking for something that works.",3
"It most definitely has the consistency of very thick, unfiltered honey- like still on the comb, but it doesn't smell like honey to me which is why I knocked one star off.  I have a pretty discerning nose, the honey smell is while it's still in the pot but after you begin to rub it into your face it smells like shoe polish or ivory soap to me.  The warming sensation is quite alarming at first, but it goes away after a few seconds, and I have incredibly sensitive skin so that is saying something.  I only leave it on for five minutes, but it does what I need it to do.  I was surprised, upon second applications' removal, to find that my forehead ""wrinkles"" are gone.  This is definitely a permanent fixture in my weekly routine, my face is soft and hydrated and it looks smoother.  Another wonderful Farmacy product that I'm not allergic to!",4
"It ok.  I received this product In shades emit and cosmic complimentary from Influenster.  It says it’s a ‘brightening’ concealer.  While it does brighten, it doesn’t do a good job to actually conceal my dark circles under my eyes.  I’m confused by the product.  It seems like it doesn’t know what it’s really supposed to do.  I like the packaging and the idea of the product is great!! It just didn’t hit the mark for me.  Maybe I would have been happier with a darker shade, as the ones I received were quite light and didn’t cover.  I actually think this is more of a primer than a concealer.  It could work for you if you don’t have much to cover",0
"I took a chance. Gentle enough to take off my mascara without irritating my eyes. Tiny bit on my fingertips, rub over eyelids and wiped with a warm washcloth, miraculously removed with out raccoon eyes. Never taken off that easy before. Smoothed the rest of my face, no irritation to my seriously sensitive skin.",4
"I took one star off because the shade Fair is a little deeper than I expected. I was concerned that this shade may not work well with my skin but with brightening primer and setting powder, I guess the shade works fine since it does not turn orange on me. Compared to my favorite Chanel tinted moisturizer, this one is more sheer and silky. I like the scent and how moisturizing it is. It's not matte finish but dewy. If you're dry skin and looking for something to use in winter instead of liquid foundation, I think you can give one a try.",1
"I took these religiously for 3 months and I saw absolutely no difference in my hair growth or quality. I did see a difference in my overall energy level though, strangely (not sure if related, impossible to know), perhaps because of the insane amount of B12 (which helps with anemia/fatigue/weakness). They are easy to take because they are tasty, so that’s good, but I think that unless you are seriously lacking something in your diet, forbidding your hair to be at its best, and you generally eat healthy, you won’t see a difference.",2
"I totally have fallen in love with this product. I have been using for about 3 weeks now and my skin has never felt smoother amd soft. The only negative I fond about it is the smell, its not a perfume smell its more like an ingredient or something but its not to horrible to where i cant take it plus its totally worth it for the results im getting. my skin isnt textured no more and so so so soft and my foundation looks AMAZING. I received this product free for my 100% honest review and opinion....I would 100% recommend this.",4
"I travel extensively for my work. I just returned home from a six month gig abroad. Whilst away, I started using this serum, first as a trial size from a Sephora with-purchase beauty offer. Then I received another trial size in one of my monthly beauty box subscriptions. I enjoyed it and read a lot of positive reviews and I thought I might be seeing some results (at least, I wanted to think I was seeing some small result), so I bought the 50ml bottle. I've used it nightly and every weekday morning for the past 3 or 4 months. Today  I'm back at home and was enjoying a cook-out with several neighbors-turned-dear-friends. Then, I knew it wasn't just my wishful thinking that this serum was effective when one of my [male] neighbors asked me what I'd ""had done"" when I was away. He kept insisting something was different but he couldn't quite place it. Of course, I shrug and claim nothing new or different about me, unless it's that my hair is a bit longer. ;D \n\nProbably not instantly gratifying, but positive results are noticed over time. It took a few years for those lines and wrinkles to develop, they aren't going to be erased over night!",3
"I tried a sample just once of these and now I want to buy these rather expensive resurfacing pads. I think they are worth it since my skin looks better than with any other product including Dr. Brandt. However, you might not like the smell since it does have that vinegary scent. I also love their rather ingenious mini two finger mitt!",3
"I tried a sample of this and It covered okay. Then about and hour or so later I broke out into a rash. My skin usually can take anything. I didnt use any different cleansers or moisturizers this morning. Didnt eat anything different and I sanitize my brushes regularly. So I do know it was the foundcealer. Although it covered my skin quite well, I wasnt impressed with the rash on my face for the rest of the day.",2
I tried a sample of this cream last year and when I decided I needed a new regular day and night cream I ordered a jar of  this I'm glad I did it's very hydrating and my face feels so refreshed I highly recommend this if you want something that's non-greasy. it's soaks into my skin quickly.,3
"I tried au natural and left a not so thrilled review..but, since I Love Bobbi Brown I thought Strike A Rose would be the winner. I am sorry to say while the shade is lovely the application of these glosses just do not work. To heavy, hard to apply and bleeds like crazy. I will use it sparingly as a lip topper only due to cost. I love all the other Lip products in this line..but these are a No..",4
"I tried many skin care products. But Tatcha seems to hit home. It definitely is worth every penny! I also have the 8 full size products from the Obento Set! Love it, Love it, Love it! It's a bonus that it works with all skin types too.",4
"I tried samples of this and it really did give me a nice glow. I have tried several other brands of vitamin C serums and they all seem to be somewhat similar. It really comes down to price and formulation preference. This is expensive as others have stated, but I would buy a single tube to take on vacation.",3
"I tried samples of this product before buying it, and I got lucky and caught it on sale!!!!! This tingles when you put it on, but doesn’t burn like other peels I’ve tried, and it did the job! Almost immediately after rinsing this mask off, my skin was softer, more vibrant looking and felt hydrated! I will definitely repurchase!",0
"I tried the ""Blemish"" stickers and was surprised that you can see and feel the little needles. They don't hurt to apply but it is an uncomfortable, prickly feeling, and my skin is a bit oily for them because it took a lot of pressing to make it stay on my skin (I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin). The needle-like things (they're tiny) disappear by morning which kind of freaked me out. My zit had shrunk but it went from slightly pink to a purple scar-colored mark and took about three days to fade back to my skin color. It was a giant zit and this sticker did help, but I recently tried ""Mighty Patch"" stickers from Hero Cosmetics and they were cheaper. Maybe I'll save these ""Blemish"" stickers just for the giant zits. The review makes you mark whether you'd recommend it or not, so while it's not a bad product, I don't know that I would buy more once these run out.",0
I tried the hand lotion at sephora but It didn't blow me away like the whip body lotion.  I felt like the hand cream did not sink in like whip textured cream.  The smell is still divine and I would most certainly purchase this as a gift for a friend.  The smell last for quiet a while.,4
"I tried the regular Kush mascara and although I enjoyed how it separated and lengthened my lashes, I hated the great amount of transfer on to my upper and lower lids.  within 2-3hours I looked like a raccoon!  I purchased the waterproof version in hope it wouldn't transfer but it let me down because IT DID!  Back to my search for the best mascara for my lashes!  I'm currently enjoying MF Smoky Extravagant. that's great for evening wear.  I want something more subtle for daily use.  In my opinion, these are a waste of money.",3
I tried the sample first as it came in a set and didn't think I would use it as much honestly but the set had a full size moisturizer and few things to try for a great price.\nThis serum not only helped me with my acne scars but also hydrates my skin. I never used a serum before but this is a must must must have.,0
"i tried this as a sample since it's so expensive.  the smell is very strong, like grassy herbs, but is not as bad as other parts led me to believe. Smells very similar to Dr. Hashuka and other all natural products. It's a very sheer moisturizer...I'd actually call it more like a serum. it does a great job of illuminating my skin, alone and under makeup. it's nice,  but with the steep price tag, I'm not sure I will purchase a full size.",3
"I tried this as a sample. When I first started to apply it I was amazed how easy it went on and blended. But it looked very heavy and made my pores stand out. I have oily skin, but not overly, and it started to breakdown probably within 4 hours and started looking worse. I don't like this foundation at all! I would not purchase it.",2
"I tried this because JoJo raves about it and her skin is amazing. I'm 53 and I just added this to my routine, I've combined it with Juice Beauty peel, Philosophy microdelivery Peel, Dr. Jart Peptide Serum, Murad Prebiotic 3 in 1 spray, Good Gene's, Tidal, and the results are amazing. My skin is glowing, it feels and looks smooth. I also recommend facial acupuncture.",3
"I tried this by accident, really. I rushed out of the house on a Monday morning, figuring I could do my makeup while stopped at traffic lights on the way to work...\n\nI forgot to pack my makeup bag.\n\nEnter Lola (name changed to protect the innocent), a Good Southern Girl who is never without. She had this foundation packed in her makeup bag, so I used it.\n\nFirst, you will need a primer with this. Unfortunately, Lola didn't carry one with her, and I felt like my pores and fine lines were on an overhead projector all day long. \n\nIt was comfortable to wear. The finish was really beautiful, not too matte.\n\nThe coverage was amazing, and really did last all day. \n\nThe thing I didn't like?  People commented on my makeup, and not my skin.\n\nSUMMARY:  Stays on as advertised, good coverage, needs a primer, result looks 'made-up'.",3
"I tried this for the first time in the Fetish Eyes set that I got today and immediately ordered the full size! This mascara may replace my holy grail Better Than Sex! It made my lashes look amazing, and multiple coats didn't lead to clumping or crusty feeling lashes! My lashes actually feel soft so it really is nourishing as well as delivering beautiful lashes!",3
I tried this foundation in 2 different shades and with several different primers as well as without primer and after a couple hours it went in my pores and looked horrible! I returned both bottles because I was so unhappy with this product that I was so excited for. The undertones are also off with the neutral not being a true neutral at all. \nI honestly wish I never purchased this foundation!,3
"I tried this foundation twice. Once alone and once with primer and both times it's done nothing but enhance my blemishes, cause more blemishes and look like cracked powder on my face. I have to apply a ton of powder on top to cover it and it still looks bad. \nNot for dry skin at all as it enhances every dry patch.\nI love all of the other Fenty products I've tried previously but this is a no go. I'll be returning it",0
"I tried this hoping it would help get rid of the Malassezia (tiny bumps) I kept getting all over my forehead and some on my cheeks, nose, and chin. This broke me out soooo bad - worse than any product I've ever used. My face is extra dry, red, and irritated now AND there's a million bumps all over. If you want to try witch hazel, proceed with caution!",0
I tried this mascara because it stated it wouldn't clump/smudge.  I ended up with black underneath my eyes.  I am still I  search of a mascara that will work and give me what I need.  I think Milk gives better volume than this one.,2
I tried this mask multiple times and had the same stinging response while it was on my face. It was very uncomfortable. Strangely my skin didn't look irritated after I washed it off. If you have sensitive skin maybe try a sample first.,0
I tried this morning and evening for some time and really didn't do anything for me. I'm not sure why and I was really stoked to try it based on the reviews but sad to say it didn't work for me. dare I say it even made me look worse?? definitely not better...,2
"I tried this on a whim - the idea of using Iris extract just seemed like a lovely self care item. I now look forward to using this every day (I currently only use in the morning, I plan on trying out twice a day soon) and really treasure it as part of my routine. \n\nI can't really describe exactly what it does, I just know that I'm glowing after use, and I notice right away in days that I skip this step. I want to say it hydrates while keeping my from getting too oily during the day (I have dry skin that overcompensates and gets oily throughout the day), and it makes my skin feel like velvet.  it has no smell, and the bottle is well designed and reliable. \n\nI currently layer this on first, after cleansing, and then top with a serum and moisturizer.",0
I tried this on my hand in store and it was so smoothing and left my skin so soft and when you apply it to your face it feels wonderful BUT......the second you open the jar all you can smell is alcohol.  It's like the 3rd or 4th ingredient listed. You dont notice in store because you are overwhelmed by scents. I'll use this jar but wont repurchase.  My bad for not doing my research,3
"I tried this out, but there were plant oils added which impart a strong fragrance. I happen to be sensitive to any fragrance in my cosmetics and skincare products, and this was overwhelming to me. if you don't mind the smell, this may work for you.",3
"I tried this past weekend it quite like it. Its buildable medium to high coverage with beautiful matte finish. I wore it for day time and tried for night time as well. One thing I noticed is that its not long lasting, i need to bloat after 4 hours and after lunch my T-zone was shinny especially my nose",2
"I tried this product a few different ways... as prep before makeup, to set and as a touch up.  I didn't really notice any changes in my makeup to be honest.   Makeup application was the same.  After using to set, I still felt the need to go with UD all nighter.  When it came time to touch up, it did nothing to get rid of my oiliness.  I still had to use my Fenty blotting powder and Marc Jacobs accomplice.  I'm kinda jealous of all the other rave reviews!  I love tons of other Tatcha products but I'm kinda glad I don't need to add this to my everday routine.  My wallet thanks me.  3 stars for the packaging, the ultra fine mist and the fragrance.  I hate to say this but it's a hard pass for me.",2
"I tried this three times, twice on bare skin and once over a serum, then threw it in the trash. I couldn't get it to be anything but heavy, sticky, and greasy feeling. I don't want my skin to be tacky! Time to try something else for my mild redness and irritation. One star because it does provide a layer of color to hide redness.",4
I tried this years ago when CT first hit the scene with this. And thought to give it another go and purchased again. The reason being is the duo is awesome together and I had great results the first time. This is not a full coverage concealer. Its something to use on those days when you just want to look rested and need something to pair up with a tinted moisturizer. A lil goes a long way for me and my lovely shadows under my eyes. The formula is still the same for both the eye cream and brightener. I'm glad I decided to pick it up again.,3
I tried to really like this eyelash curler. It's okay but I don't really see a difference in eyelash curlers. It seemed similar to others I've used although it's not as curved so took some getting used to. The color is nice though - mine is more of a nice copper color.\n\nI received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.,0
"I tried using this every possible way. With a brush, with a brush and setting spray, on bare skin, on foundation, with my finger, with a beauty blender, etc! I had to work so hard to get the most minimal colour show up. Not impressed.",0
"I truly wanted to love this, but it is just not for me  I have huge pores and it seemed to just amplify each and every one of them. The glow it gives you is gorgeous,  however if you have large pores the glow will not distract from how big the pores look. I will be returning",2
"it's a 1 star, but keeps going to 2. I tried this on for one day, for some reason my lips have never been so dry and the ends ripped! what kind of a balm is this?! I never write reviews but this one was a must.",1
"It's a cool little thing. It has an app that ""custom designs"" your skincare routine. It just sets the device to vibrate for 10 seconds 5x (total of 50 seconds washing your face). \nIt's not super special. I wouldn't buy it again.",4
"It's actually amazing, I've tried a lot of lip masks and they're usually sooo goopy, but this is the perfect amount of goop to thinness ratio that it doesn't feel awful on your lips. It makes your lips feel sooo smooth as well.",1
"It's a decent moisturizer but I hate jars - especially this one which is extra plastic.  If it was in a tube or pump, it would have a slight chance that I would buy again, but it's not so one and done.",2
"It's a decent oil for precleansing and taking off makeup. The thick consistency melts down when applied to dry skin and spreads fairly easily. While it does remove makeup and grime really well and hasn't caused any breakouts on my come skin, I don't see myself repurposing. I use other products from this line that are great but this Squalane Cleanser doesn't add much and is mediocre compared to others out there.",2
"it's a good set but the minis are indeed MINI. like I cannot describe how mini. I wanted to use this for Xmas gifts and will probably use them as stocking stuffers. if i had paid 42$ I would return it but I got it for 25$ today, so might as well keep it and give it to family during the Holidays. disclaimer: obviously its for gifts so I haven't actually tried the products. this is more of a review for size x money",0
"It's alright. Nothing to get excited about. Champagne pop performs, it's a tiny sample but it's ok. I find the primer sensitizing probably because of the fragrance but again it's alright. I hate the powder. It's patchy, it pills, and has no refreshing effect. I hated it every time I used it.",2
It's a nice set for clearance/sale price but I would not purchase for retail. I'm not sure if these are somewhat old or its just the formula but they are a bit thick & sticky. Not a deal breaker though. I really love the shades & that they are opaque. It's much like lipstick & gloss in one. Overall pretty pleased with my purchase,3
It's an ideal situation when you can combine skincare with makeup. This product is incredible. I mix 1 pump of this with my Origins tinted SPF in my hands and apply it like a moisturizer. So easy and applies flawlessly. There isn't 1 person on the daily who doesn't tell me I look tanned and glowing. Definitely an amazing product. This is a must for anyone wanting to take care of their skin and wanting a natural sunkissed look at the same time.,4
"It's a really fun color and I love mattes. I only had to add one application half way through the day and that's because of lunch. Maybe I'm being too picky, but the transfer was the only thing that bothered me.",0
"It's a very creamy concealer. Its medium coverage. It can look a bit cakey if you apply too much, I would suggest use it sparingly since it is a bit thick and add as needed. I notice when I use my fingers it looked the best. I like how it has a natural finish. Easy to apply and blend out. Didnt notice any creasing around the eyes.",1
"It’s a very moisturizing cream, and leaves my skin baby soft when I wake up in the morning. The scent is good, there was an adjustment period as I was getting used to the thickness of the cream and adjusting the rest of my regimen to compensate.\n\nOverall, I like it. The packaging is a bit annoying, the product keeps leaking out after you take what you need and ends up smooshed all over the inside of the cap. So I have knocked one star off for that.",2
"It says there are only 6 things that make up this essence, and if that's the case, I wish it wasn't so expensive!!  A little goes a long way, but this stuff is like magic. it takes redness away and any kind of breakout I have, I will take a Qtip and put it on the blemish and within a couple days, it goes down. I love this stuff. If you live near a sephora I guess you can go in and get a sample and try it out for yourself. This is really worth trying if you have skin issues.",2
"It's been about 4 weeks now that I have been using this product and I have to say that I am not dissatisfied with this product. This is my first essences and I am glad that I have chosen fresh essence because it provided an internal glow after the first few days of usage. My skin was pretty dull but this overall enhance my serums and now my skin never has looked any better.  I feel like this product will last such a long time because I do not use cotton pads for application. I just pure 5 to 6 drops in my hands, rub them together and gently pat my face, under eye region and my neck. Only down fall is that it does have a citrus scent so for those who skin is sensitive to fragrance, this may not be a good choice.",4
"It's been less than a week using this product and I can't remember my face ever looking better. My skin is very sensitive with mild rosecea, and retinol is either too irritating for it, or can only be used in very small almost useless doses. But after just a few days of daily use, my skin is smooth, plump, and clear, and even the redness of my rosecea is calmed (which no product in three decades has EVER done for me). I was skeptical of trying Bakuchiol at first since it's a newer buzzy find, and this particular serum is cream colored while the plant which the oil is derived from is purple, but the noticable are results blew me away. A must-have for sensitive skins avoiding retinol and the lowest priced product I've found.",4
"Its cleanser very good, but this moisturizer, it didn't do much for my skin. I think it did help, but not to the point where I noticed it (that's why I said ""I think""). It did make certain part of my face itchy after a few usage and I think I did break out a tiny bit. Don't use it if you have very dried skin and very, very, very dried skin (my skin is so sensitive that I can't use cetaphil. Its not that it breaks me out, but it burns me aftrr 3 days of usage).",0
It's crazy how different products can affect the skin differently. I got a small travel size of this mask with some other rose Lancome products. The hydrating rose toner did made my skin burn.  I was reluctant to use the jelly mask. But one day my skin was flaking so bad and none of my moisturizers were helping. The moment I used this mask my skin was so hydrated!  I couldn't believe it. No irritation either.  This product has become a staple for me.,2
"It's definitely a hefty price tag, but I love this product!  It smells heavenly, and it really does work.  My skin feels really soft, and it glows after I use this.  I wondered how different it would be from using a good exfoliator/scrub and an acid lotion/toner, but there is definitely a difference.  Highly recommend!",2
"it's fine if you like peeling and PILLING. I wore it to bed and, in the morning, applied my SPF as usual. just NO. chunky bits came off on my hands as I tried to rub it in. it's like the moisturizer had not absorbed from the night before. I was annoyed. had to wash my face and start anew.",1
"It's good for normal to dry skin. It does not accentuate dry patches. It has thinner consistency compare to Tarte Shape Tape so it doesn't cakeup as you build up the coverage. However, it settles in my undereye lines if I wait too long to set it.",4
"It's just okay.\nI Will say the packaging is great. and better than most ABH palettes out there.\nThe Pigments could be better for almost $40 +Tax Canadian. \nI am going to use this again and keep it but I will say that my first impression was ""Okay it just a more convenient palette""\nI will say that I feel like I have to pair this with another Palette in order to get a look I like.",4
It's literally water consistency so it's very hard to use. You have to cup your hand to pour some on your hand and then almost splash your face. The formula will make your eyes burn and doesnt always get your eye make up off; you have to really rub. Because the formula is like water you have to use quite a bit of it to get all your make up off.,1
It smells just like popcorn! \nSo if you don't mind smelling like you have been sitting in a movie theater all night you might like it. :) \nI will stick to Bum Bum Cream Great smell feels great on your skin!,3
"it smells like a multivitamin for your skin and works like one too ! this product brightens, evens and hydrates my skin thru the night and I wake up glowing :) the best part is it's not oily at all and doesn't run off on my pillow while sleeping. holds true to the skin all through the night. this is giving me life !",4
"It smells lovely, but either I didn't chose the correct color for my skintone or it just doesn't show up on the skin.  It goes on easily, but disappears quite quickly.  It's thick and I can feel it on my skin, but it's not sticky and doesn't get on my clothes.  I was hoping for a sparkle or even a sheer tint, but I didn't get it.",3
"it smells nice, feels nice, and moisturizes.. but other than that, it doesn't do much else. I've been using it for a few months and I've finished the bottle now. for $50 I expected more. there is no difference to my eyes. will not be repurchasing",0
"It's my favourite and the best cream blush. Yes minimum colour range. 20 yrs ago had many colours but now down to 3 colours . I have all 3. Well stila please don't discontinue this. Although I've tried many brand always come back to stila cream blush. It is the best lush with easy application and blendable with fingers or sponge. Avery little goes long way. Just with some moisturiser , tint, sunscreen or foundation underneath . Pretty lasting too. Fantastic for mature skin too . All wheathers too. Minus 1 star for less colors. That's fantastic product",3
"It's ok....smears my makeup around more than anything, but it does technically remove makeup. If you wash your face after you use it, it'll remove the residue of smeared makeup. It's not greasy though which I like.",4
"It's one of the best out there and I've tried many. My favorite pen tip - gives me superior control over my wings which because of my wrinkles is getting to be challenging getting ""just right"". It's very very black which is good, ink flow is good (which is an issue I had with others before causing me to go back over and over strokes ugh). It's water-resistant on me but absolutely nothing is tear-proof with my one watery eye lol arghhh. Now.....we need more colors! I would like to see: a nice grey, a chocolate brown, and a beautiful hazel green. I would buy them all up! :)",1
"it's only been 2 weeks, and I took the time to take a picture before using it and after...and I'm innn loovvee! \nthere's a huge difference with my dark circle and it's so moisturize the next morning. \nNo more pufiness in the morning also.",1
"It sounds like several of the the negative reviews had expectations that this is supposed work like a serum. But the thing is: this is a filler, and much like pore-minimizing primers, the product fills in the fine line to make them APPEAR reduced. The ingredient that makes the tingling sensation is like lip plumping gloss - it intentionally sets off a little inflammation, which causes a tiny bit of swelling of the tissue, which stretches out the line (temporarily). The swelling isn't going to last long, so that's where the filler property comes in. Once you cleanse, the effect is removed. Also, just target specific lines or small areas and pat this into it; don't smear it all over your face to treat All The Lines, otherwise you'll be wasting most of this expensive product. I found it did minimize my crows feet & forehead lines - I use it under makeup. Just don't expect long-term improvement in lines and wrinkles.\n\nDocked a star due to the very steep price - it works well enough for what it is, but there are good drugstore fillers that achieve the same result.",3
It's overall a good oil. I use this when my skin is a bit dry from the products I use for acne. my only complaint is that the smell never goes away. I put 3 drops into my moisturizer and follow up with sunscreen and makeup. I can literally smell this throughout the day on my face until I wash it off.,4
"It's pretty but I dont think I'll repurchase, not worth the price for the amount of product. I know I can find something similar for half the price but if you have the extra money I do recommend it. The color is flattering, although more shimmery in person. I don't find the scent to be strong like others are saying.",4
"It's pretty, but I reach for other blushes more. It's quite pigmented so I have to use a soft hand, but I love that I can choose between a matte or a luminous blush look. The packaging is super cute, like a fancy bar of soap, but not necessarily a must-have",0
"It's rare that dark lipsticks are fully opaque in one swipe but Fenty nailed this formula. Underdawg is a gorgeous, deep maroon. This shade looks amazing with just sharp eyeliner and wispy lashes. PLEASE make this shade permanent! It's sold out everywhere and I can see myself going through it quickly.",0
"It's really good for lengthening as other reviews have said and yes, it does make your lashes stick a bit and flake. But I find that it flakes less if you use eyelash primer first. I still like it overall. I like it more than Tarte's lights camera lashes mascara, which doesn't make my lashes look as full as the NARS climax does.",4
"It's silky. It's not greasy, or sticky or goopy.  It feels similar to a silicone primer without the clogging of the pores. Perfect for under makeup wear. Made my skin look really nice. For those of us who wear makeup everyday, who are eternally searching for the perfect moisturizer that won't break apart our makeup and doesn't take minutes to dry. This is it!",4
Its so beautiful! However，the packaging is too inconvenient. It is hard to pick up products since the pores are small，when it arrived，the shadows stucked in the pores so I cannot pick up products lol so sad. I strong recommend to buy this one instore instead of online because the shipping would mess the powder make it congests im the pores. But，the product itself is beautiful and so glittery！,4
"It's so hard to find colors like this that work well on dark skin--you think it's going to look ashy until you swipe it on your cheekbones á la Rihanna and then....OH.EM.GEE. I literally went crazy in the group chat afterwards! My favorite look is Scandal'ice as a highlighter and over my lids, and Subzero in the outer corner of my lids. For a warmer look I love Heartburn topped with Coppin Ice. It's all super flattering and a nice break from regular golden highlighters; you really can't go wrong with this!",4
"It's so overlooked every time I go to Sephora. So unassuming and tucked away. But when you ask an associate about it, its holy grail. It has a thicker consistency and takes a few seconds longer to soak in , but the benefits far outweigh what it does. It leaves soon feeling so soft and plump. It literally preps my skin for what's next on my regimen. This has definetly upped my skin regimen. I would invest in the bigger bottle next time. I'm only 1/4 of the bottle down. You only need a little. Apply.directly into palm and patty directly onto skin. Do not use a cotton ball, you're just wasting valuable product!\n\nHighly recommend like my life depended on it.",1
"Its so small but it worth for the price. You know sometime if you didnt use the contour in right way, your face really looks so dirty. But this product, i have to say its the best contour, you dont need worry about the color, it looks so natural. I love this contour.....",1
"it's such a great and moisturizing mask! i have oily skin and i sometimes use this at night as a moisturizer and in the morning my skin is so smooth and glowing!\nBUT I'm giving this a four star because the both sizes used to be bigger with the same price. now, the small is 30ml when it used to be 50ml before. I love this product but that's really upsetting",0
"Its the cheapest way to get the free shipping rates at 50$+, as an Insider, when there's couple dollars missing. I dont recommend this product or any other strips. Just avoid theses. Its only an ""on the go"" that you can easily carry with you everyday, everywhere, anywhere or in your pocket and use it once in a while...",1
it's the same as the regular mineral veil. I went in store and compared the two. I'm not sure what the other commenters are talking about. the container is beautiful and if you use mineral veil then grab this!,4
"It's way too glittery and there's so much fallout! I thought the shimmer would be subtle, that the glitter particles would be micro. But it's super glittery and gritty. It's not a terrible product, but it's extremely overpriced for a quad palette of decent, overly glitzy, less-than-stellar shadows.",4
"It takes a lot to impress me with skincare, and this set did not disappoint! cleanser works great and smells great, face cream is moisturizing while still feeling light, and the eye cream really does brighten. The value of this set is amazing as well!",1
"It took me some adjusting as I'm new to anything other than powder makeup, but as soon as I got the hang of, I FELL IN LOVE! it's really creamy and doesn't feel super heavy on the skin. I have pretty oily skin and it does show through a bit but I found using a similar colored eyeshadow to ""set"" it helps a little. I've already abused mine quite a lot and will probably continue to purchase this as I run out it.",4
it was OKAY. \nit didnt give me that super clean feeling after using a toner.\nit didnt do much for my acne or oily skin either \nmaybe just wasnt working for me..\nand the stuff in the solution itself did get pretty annoying after awhile.,4
"It was way too tacky for me. The primer smeared as I tried to apply my foundation, causing terrible blotches. It the last time I try smashbox. I just haven't been a fan of the three products I've bought by smashbox.",1
"It worked ok when I first bought it, but after a week it started drying and making it difficult to put on extra coats. I have had it for about a month now and it's starting to flake plus it clumps my eyelashes. I haven't seen any growth or improvement in my lashes. I prefer Laura Mercier caviar or Pat McGrath's mascaras.",3
"It works, but it's just eh. don't get me wrong, I do like it! its completely scentless, is thick and lathers nicely. it gets the job done but it's pretty plain. I have sensitive skin but I'm prone to acne. this product was definitely good for sensitive skin but did nothing for my acne. they do have a different cleanser that I really love, but I dont think I'll ever buy this one again.",0
"it works great, after about a week and a half where I had extra dry patches on my skin while it was getting used to the retinol my skin is now glowy and almost completely acne free. This has been the only change in my skincare regime in around two months so it's safe to say that the retinol is probably doing its job.",0
"It Works!!\nSo far this product is great on my skin. After just one day my skin was already brighter, felt softer and my skin tone was more even. Also helped decrease size of new pimples I had on my face. I've been using it for 5 days straight and comparing day 1 to day 5 my skin looks undeniably brighter and healthier! If it gets rid of all my dark marks I will definitely give it 5 stars!5",1
it works SO WELL. my pores feel so clean and my skin look much better after using! the best part - this mask does not hurt. every clay mask I've ever used (both high end and drugstore brands) has made my skin hurt. this mask is super gentle and instead feels like a nice cooling effect as it dries. plus it's less than 20 dollars! I've heard hype about this product and innisfree in general for years. I totally get it now.,4
"It works very well when you stick them in the freezer. \n\nLike other reviewers said, they don't stay on your eyes very well, so you have to hold them. I used an loose eye mask that has extra space for the eye area to keep them on so I don't have to hold them.\n\nThese are most likely not going to fit onto your eye grooves like how you want, but besides that it chills your eyes nicely.",4
"I typically do not leave reviews. However no matter how great this product is, the packaging is terrible! lid cracked open and 70% of the product leaked out into my travel bag. It was packed delicately how I would normally pack my skincare. Disappointed for the price.",1
"I typically do not wear concealer since I don't have dark circles. I do like the idea for brightening, but a lot of concealers leave my under eye area looking dry, not so with the Ilia True Skin Serum Concealer. I love this product. I have been using it for about a month and love the lightweight moisture it provides, and I only need a small amount to make my eyes really brighten up and look fresh all day. I do not set with powder, but do gently tap in a few small dots with my ring finger under my eye and on my lid and blot in with a slightly damp beauty blender. I also use this to cover a little redness on my cheeks before my foundation application. The coverage is amazing and it lasts all day through sweat, heat, and humidity and looks as good as when I put it in 13 hours later! I will buy this product and highly recommend. This works great on mature skin, does not settle into fine lines and is not drying. received this product complimentary"" from Influenster for testing purposes.",3
"I typically don't use a primer, but with the weather being so hot lately I needed my face makeup to stay on without breaking up by the end of the day. I'm so happy to see a primer that doesn't have any silicones to clog pores. it has a lot of great ingredients and smells amazing. I would definitely recommend trying this out over the more silicone heavy primers. I received this product from influenster complimentary for testing purposes.",3
"I typically love Bite products. However, this smells nasty, and lingers under your nose. Moreover, the consistency is thin, and a bit dull for a gloss (or maybe I tried too desperately to apply the bare minimum to avoid the stench). I'm not even sensitive to smell and can typically weather anything, it's just nauseating.",0
"I typically wear tinted moisturizer w/ SPF every day. I've been searching for a light, moisturizing foundation I could wear at night or on days when I don't need SPF. I'm 52, my skin is fairly even in tone but tends to be dry",3
"I use all of these brushes everyday as my first choice. The amount of brushes you get for the price is pretty great. I love all the face brushes especially the contour brush that I use for blush, the foundation brush, and the powder brush. Great complexion set.",0
"I used (and loved!) the old formula for years - I'm not happy with the new version. This does not make my skin look dewy and beautiful - instead I end up looking dry and patchy. Really disappointed that I can't get the old formula anymore, guess I need to start looking for a new product.",1
"I used a trial size of this a year ago but I was trying so many different things I couldn't tell which one was working (I had just turned into a skincare junkie) but I got another one from the reward bazaar amd ordered the Dr Dennis Gross retinol eye serum and O M G. NOTHING has made the crepiness under my eyes go away until I started using both of these products, I honestly cant believe I finally found something that works. These 2 eye products will forever be in my skincare routine.",4
"I used Diorshow mascara for years and loved it, but once the formula changed, it began to flake and it no longer conditioned as it did before. I tried Lancome Hypnose mascara and it was ok but had to find an alternative when it was out of stock. This mascara is GREAT! It really reminds me of Diorshow mascara before the ""improved"" forlumation. If you want long, fanned out slightly curled conditioned lashes, try this!",3
I used Naked Skin foundation for over 3 years. Loved it. This one is nothing like it (except for the colour match). The consistency is much thicker. It didn’t blend well with UD brush. Caused breakouts (first time in years) and dry patches. This is the first product I ever returned. Now I have to find a new foundation.,2
"I used these for a week on and off while traveling. They made zero difference. Don't waste your money. The Peter Thomas Roth eye patches or the Dr. Dennis Gross eye serum work wonders for brightening and hydrating. Invest in those, not this crap.",1
I used the shade Big  Apple and I love it.  it goes on like a liquid lipstick but dries down like a creme lipstick.  Red orange is one of my fave colors but i would say it pulls more red.  Its so comfortable and can't wait to wear it out. I received this product as a free sample for complimentary for testing purposes.,4
"I used this as my holy grail mascara for about 3-4 years. I have naturally thick lashes, and this does a great job of really making an impact. At first I loved the wetter formula, because it made it so that the formula got on all of the lashes with ease. I don't think it clumps too bad at all, but there is a lot of product that is stored in the wand.\n\nHowever recently, I've noticed that this mascara is starting to get messy. It's impossible to wear on the bottom lashes unless you use a very small amount and set your under eye concealer really well. Every time I travel the mascara smears- even after it's dried down (from me sleeping on the plane). I do love the effect it gives but it seems to be a bit more messy than it's worth, and after a full day with it on more and more often I'm coming home to dark smudges on my under eye which is annoying. I hadn't noticed it being this messy before- but I also don't usually powder my under eyes because I have dry skin.\n\n I am now going to scout out some more mascaras. Overall I'd recommend it for a more dramatic look- and if you powder and are careful not to touch or rub your eyes at all, it should be good.",3
I used this because I was forming tiny bumps underneath my eye including miliea. I used it once at night. The day after when I woke up all my milea fell off. I cannot even explain how happy I am! I got a travel size but will certainly get a full size too.,1
"I used this before bed and it left my face silky soft but not feeling moisturized so I figured it would be an excellent day cream/serum as seemed to feel like the perfect primer. However, it was so drying for my skin, my foundation went clumpy and wouldn't blend. One thing to say is that it would have been perfect to go make-up free with as it leaves your skin matt and velvety.",2
"I used this eye cream for a few years and loved it.  This time around, not so much.  I am wondering if they made some changes in the ingredients.  It just doesn't seem to be working the way it used to.  Had to return.",3
"I used this for about 6 months and it did seem to help with my acne but I did notice some film on my face especially when wiping off with a wash cloth. This was my second cleanse at night and only used at night since it seemed too harsh for the mornings. My biggest complaint is with the packaging since it's a pump that is sucks out of a plastic bag. When you get to the end and there's no air, it's impossible to get the remaining product out and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of product. This is pretty disappointing considering it's not a drugstore cleanser and means I won't be repurchasing.",0
"I used this for three nights: After the first I saw no difference; after the second my skin seemed dryer, tighter and more wrinkled; the third newer skin was showing, less wrinkled but it stung around my eyes for the whole day - no matter what I put on it (water, lotion, sunscreen, makeup).  Had to return - if you have thicker/younger skin maybe it will work for you but my 50 yr. old skin which isn't usually sensitive couldn't tolerate the acid burn.",2
"i used this foundation in addition to the self refreshing concealer. i do have super dry skin and was worried that it would make my fine lines or dry patches more obvious. i couldnt be more wrong! it was hydrating,  smooth,  did not clog my pores,  break me out,  or further dry Me out. it lasted all day long and looked natural as well. it blended so good and had a very natural medium coverage, which built in my trouble areas to a full coverage very easily. it has replaced my Fenty as my go to foundation.",2
"I used this product on myself (dry, sensitive, acne prone skin) and my boyfriend (normal/dry skin).\nThis product did nothing for us except dry both of our skin out and caused some redness for both of us (we are easily prone to redness). I tried multiple times alone and atop other night creams and each time was the same result. It is so light weight it doesn't have much to offer, and it has quite a bit of fragrance in it.\nThe ingredients are not good either, I do not recommend this product to anyone. The lavender version of this is no different either. \nIf you are keen on using this, get a sample first before buying.",4
"I used this product three nights in a row to make sure I wasn't writing it off too quickly. Nope, each time I used it within my K-Beauty routine (which adds tons of hydration to your face) it made my under eyes extremely itchy and sensitive. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.",0
"I used this serum religiously morning and night until the entire bottle was used up. I can honestly say it does nothing more than any decent moisturizer can do for a lot less money.  I am a middle-aged woman with good skin and I want to do what I can to keep it that way, so I was curious about what this could do. On a side note, research suggests there is no clinical evidence that vitamin c applied to the skin does anything at all, and may actually irritate some sensitive complexions. It is when we ingest vitamin c in fruits and vegetables that it is good for our skin.  Anyway, if you can afford to blow almost 100 bucks to experiment with this, be my guest.",4
I used this the day of my wedding and my face was glowing and soft and my makeup went on beautifully according to my makeup artists. But I used the left over serum for almost a week after and my skin was so good. I am repurchasing again and giving for Christmas gifts. Thank you LA MER!,2
"I used to be a doe hard natasha denona eyeshadow lover, but melts are eve  better. i sat on buying this palette for so long because I thought the greens in this palette wouldn't work with my green eyes and I was so wrong it makes my green eyes so bright. I LOVE this palette I canta stop reaching for it over Pat McGrath, ND, and every other brand in my collection. buy it you wont regret it",4
"I used to have dark spots I called my freckles on my forehead and within a year they've fully disappeared! The texture of my skin has also visibly improved. You're probably not supposed to use it every night, especially in the beginning but I find a little goes a long way and my skin loves it.",4
"I used to have severe eczema on my hands before using this product. After using it, I no longer had to use my prescribed steroid cream. It's amazing stuff! They also have an amazing line of kids products!",2
"I used to love this mist!  But I believe the company recently reformulated and it's not as good as the original mist. They also reduced the size from 200ml to 80ml, yet the price remained $35.  Hard Pass",0
"I used to love this product, but the reformulation ruined it for me. Before they changed it I’d gone through 4-5 jars of the stuff! It was really moisturizing, but not too much for my oily skin or daytime. The new one has a less luxurious smell, less moisturizing and I think the packaging is cheaper looking. It also feels like more of a thinner gel consistency than the old one. Time to look for a new favorite moisturizer...",0
"I used to really like this mascara but this last tube I purchased smudges worse than any mascara I've ever tried. I get ""racoon eyes: in about 4 hours! It's very embarrassing. I'm not using anything new, and I don't use eye cream in the daytime.  I can't imagine why this is suddenly such a mess.",3
I used to really struggle with dry and chapped lips especially in the winter. But since using this lip sleeping mask I haven't had dry lips in over a year. In comparison to the bite Beauty Agave overnight treatment It's way more lightweight and comfortable on the lips. The smell is delicious especially the vanilla one and it just feels so hydrating and moisturizing. While I was waiting in the mail for my new lip sleeping mask I didn't use it for 2 days and I could tell the difference in my lips. This is definitely a must-have product for me and I highly recommend.,1
"I used to use Hourglass's brow sculpting pencil until I ran out and Sephora didn't have my color in stock that day.  So, I tried the brow definer by Anastasia. I have been loyal to it ever since. First of all, it's far less expensive than the pencil by Hourglass and it actually gives a better result! I used to have decent brows but as I have gotten older they have thinned considerably. I find I can create a good shape and fill them in really well with this pencil, without it looking painted on.  I get compliments all the time now on my brows which has never happened before. Highly recommend this product.",3
I used up the whole bottle and saw no difference. I take probiotics every day and the ones that I bought at the health food store do way more for my gut and skin than these ones did. I received this for free in exchange for an unbiased review.,1
"I use it, but I don't see much of a difference. I typically use it when I add too much pigmented powder (blush, bronzer, highlight) and it dulls those things nicely, but I don't like it for an undereye setting powder",0
"I use sunscreen daily and love~ trying out new ones. I tried at least 20 different sunscreens (in both high end and low end prices, including dior snow, superfluid from Kiel, Clarins, Elta-MD, dr. jart, dr. Oracle, to multiple Neutrogena brands, sun powder, sun stick, spray, and more). so far, this is one of my favorites. It absorbed quickly with dry finish (but not matte), no white residue, does not peel off with makeup, and well suited for my combination skin. I am willing to buy again after I finish my first tube. And of course I check ingredients as well.  this one is good/I consider it safe in current standards.",1
I use the primer after serum and moisturizer...lay a layer on ur problem areas or areas u want to diffuse...let it dry..takes about 5 min....if ur in a hurry put on a light layer of setting powder.....apply the rest of ur face...I am a light skinned Mexican female w/crepy smile lines and furrowed brow lines...it works pretty well in these areas..no complaints!! help the rest of the face paint come together and looks smooth...would buy it again...,4
"I use the Rainforest of the Sea foundation for special occasions, but wanted a lightweight one with sunscreen for daily use. despite not seeming to have many shades, the tarte shade selector picked light for me and it works perfectly. It's buildable with a more matte than natural finish and is long-wearing.",1
"I use these prior to applying masks as a way to prime my skin, and I absolutely love them. I have noticed that my products seem to work better and my skin is much more on point after adding these to my skin care routine.",2
"I use this about once a week. It helps even skin texture and remove dead skin build up. I find that I do have to use a light scrub with it to really get all the dead skin cells off. The payoff is amazing, you'll see all the dead skin ball up on your face to be washed away. One bottle lasts a while too so it's absolutely worth it.",4
"I use this and the other shades everyday for my lips. I love that this gives me a hint of color and keeps my lips soft. Won't stay through a meal or even through a whole cup of coffee, but it's a lip balm not a liquid lipstick. Would still reccomend this!",2
"I use this as a contour. While the color is very lovely and accentuates my face well, I'm not a big fan of how much it can smudge and rub off even after setting it. I would hope that for other skin types, it does not do that, so I might recommend it for someone that has less oily skin.",4
"I use this as an eyeliner. I'm not crazy lol hear me out. I use it on the water line. It's perfect, it's super dark &  stays on for a long time. I've had a hard time finding an eyeliner that last on the water line, they usually fade or end up all around the tear duct.  Since this is a glue it dries and stays on. I'm obviously careful not to get any in my eye (I have gotten it in my eyes and it wasn't  a big deal). I even use it on top of my eye on top of my eye liner to sort of ""seal"" the liner and no smudging at all. I can have a whole night out and at the end of the night my eyeshadow might have faded but the eyeliner is intact. One product, different uses. YES.",4
"I use this as a second cleanse following the GENIUS melting cleanser. The results are great. My skin feels clean, but not stripped.  I follow up with the Algenist toner, which I alternate with an AHA toner from another brand. I follow with different Algenist serums, and I love the way my skin is starting to look. The brand is expensive, no doubt. But it beats the more costly Perricone hands down. I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite skin care line and I will continue to use it despite the price!",4
"I use this as a serum and I must say. This skincare line by Dr.Jart has change the way my skin feels and look! this product has a very watery consistence, and a little bit goes a long way. I used to have flakey patches around my chin and cheeks. after using this serum, those flakey patch has heal. this is my holy grail skin care product!",0
I use this as a shadow rather than a topper. it blends great and gives a nice undereye accent too. If you put this too thick it does the whole wrinkle look but I put it on in a thin layer and it stayed smooth and stayed put all day. Dream is a sparkly light brown bronze on me. Does not irritate my eyes. Part of the Favorites Next Big Thing kit also.,3
"I use this as both a foundation and a concealer.  A little goes a long way - so you only need a tiny amount to give full coverage over the entire face.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is because it does show some texture on skin that is not already smooth.",3
"I use this as my go to lip stain. As an 'older than you' Sephora groupie, I need to make my lips look bigger (no injections or other implements here). This works really well alone or layered with a gloss. An everyday must. Doesn't smell, sting, or wear off.",3
I use this brush for applying my Tatcha Rice Enzyme cleanser.  It is the perfect application for that.  Unfortunately these brushes aren't meant to be exposed to so much water and the bristles fall out.  I do what I can to limit water damage by laying it flat to dry but it is exposed to a lot of water.  Hey Sephora if you're listening how about a waterproof fan brush?,3
I use this brush with tarte foundcealer foundation and I absolutely love it! It's not too big and not too small and you can swirl or stipple to get the coverage you want. The brushes are soft and dense. Perfect!,4
I use this everyday to outline my lips to keep my lipstick from feathering.  It’s simple and invisible and really works.  I’m sad that my local stores no longer carry this but at least it can still be ordered online.,3
I use this every morning before make up. love the consistency and it is very hydrating. I appreciate that it's a clean product. I'll be honest that I'm not sure it's done anything for fine lines but I like the product overall due to the hydration it provides and it's good under make up.,2
"I use this every time I apply make up. it brings so much life to the face. it is really natural looking and I prefer it over a lot of highlighters. I use it on nose apple of cheeks, under my eyes and on my forehead",4
"I use this in Bamboo, and it is the best lipliner I have found.  For me it is a MLBB shade, and I can wear this alone with lip balm over it, and it looks great.  No fragrance and no irritation. My skin is light and neutral.  I keep buying this again and again.",3
I use this mask whenever I have breakouts and it shrinks my pimples almost flat in the 30-45 minutes I keep it on. I also use it as a spot treatment at night. The best face mask I've tried and I feel like I've tried everything,0
"I use this moisturizer and also bought some for my daughter, who has sensitive skin and we both love it.  It's very soothing to sensitive skin and has a light rose scent.  It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling fresh and hydrated.  I hope the company continues to make this one - it's become a ""staple"" of our skin care routine.",3
"I use this Squalane Cleanser as the first part of my double cleanse. I don't wear makeup, but I do feel like I have a build up of oil and grime/sweat from the day on my face. I love how this product makes my skin feel clean and hydrated. I follow up with a SA cleanser and it is just the perfect one two punch. After cleansing my face feels super clean and ready to absorb my serums.",0
I use this stuff followed by First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firm Sleeping cream every night.  My skin looks incredible the next morning with no makeup.  I highly recommend adding to your anti-aging skin care routine.,4
I use this thicker cream as a moisturizer at night and wake up with my skin a perfect balance -- not dry and not greasy. It smells good like the other Cicapair products too. I received this product for free/complimentary for testing purposes.,0
"I use this twice a day after I cleanse and tone my face before moisturizer. I get incredibly dry skin during the winter months and find this product to be helpful to my sensitive skin without adding 'heaviness' to my face. Alone this would not be a good moisturizer for me, but as a supplement to my current moisturizer, it's a valuable and welcome addition. The smell is refreshing and light; not at all offensive.",4
"I usually buy the sin primer but because of the sale I got this one to try too, it works just the same it kept my eye shadow on the whole day without creasing. I don't wear eye liners so I'm not sure if I'll keep liners on but definitely for eye shadows it does. and also the anti aging sounds very appealing.",1
I usually don't use powder foundations but thought I'd give it a shot during the summer as I tend to get a bit oily. let me start off by saying that this is an amazing product. The coverage is amazing (especially for a powder). It makes my skin look like I have an Instagram filter on my face and makes my skin look flawless! I took off half a star for the price ($50 is steep for a powder!) and took off another half star for having the powder crumble within a few weeks! My heart broke when I opened my compact to find it broken. I didn't even put it in my purse for touch ups throughout the day to avoid having it shatter and it still shattered. I'm still going to use it all up but wish there was a way to keep the powder together longer.,2
"I usually love Anastasia, everything I've tried has been amazing, but man what the heck. I was so happy when this came in, only to be highly disappointed by its colour. it is not just yellow toned, this is very yellow. I put it on my face and it looked like I was wearing yellow chalk. it doesnt feel nice either, I have very clear skin but this felt so gritty. I hope it was just the product I recieved and not the whole line, but I do not reccomend.",0
"I usually love boscia products...but not this one.  For starters its not a peel as described.  It's messy to use with the black charcoal instantly separating from the oil base, leaving gooey black blobs stuck to my hands.  The remaining oil doesn't dry into a peel as stated on the packaging.",3
"I usually love IT cosmetics. i have oily to normal skin but this toner has so much alcohol, actually dried my skin out. every time I used it my skin felt tight and uncomfortable. helped a bit with pores but nothing to write home about...not worth.",1
"I usually only wear nude lipsticks and really like the ABH formula so I was excited about purchasing this set. Unfortunately, the colors looked terrible on me. They are cool undertones, but I have other cool toned lipsticks that look nice on me and these just... don't. I see reviews saying they would be better suited for light skin tones, but I'm very light and they didn't work for me at all. I returned my set.",4
"I usually read reviews and do a lot of research before I buy something, but this palette caught my eye and became an impulse buy. I quickly learned my lesson. This palette is beyond frustrating - textures are not the same, first 3 are chunky and glittery, the 4th is creamy and gritty. The so-called 'bounce' is exaggerated. You have to rub your finger into the shadow for a looong time before you can apply and even then, it comes out uneven and 'dirty'. Primer makes it even worse. Tapping does not work, you have to swipe/rub, which is not something anyone should be doing this much with their fingers around the delicate eye area. And yes, there is fallout. How they can say that there isn't is beyond me. The first two shades are especially bad. Overall, this was a huge disappointment and a waste of money. I can't return it and can't even give it away because I feel like it might offend the person to receive a product this bad.",1
"I usually use a CC foundation (amore pacific) I love it, but I wanted to try erborian. I am so glad I did!  It's light and I like the sheer coverage. I don't see fine lines. It is a favorite now. I can go between the CC and the BB foundations. Yes!",4
"I usually use Fresh balms but decided to try this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It glides on easily, lasts a decent amount of time and doesn't make me feel like I constantly have to reapply.  I think it'll be a good option for NYC winters as it's pretty hydrating.  I'm also happy with the Coconut scent as it's not too much and after a few minutes, I don't notice it.",2
"I usually use the Shiseido Essential Energy series but they didn’t sell it at this one Sephora location, so I decided to try this Waso series. Comparing the two, this one leaves my skin feeling sticky and I realized I was breaking out from it. It could just not be for me.",0
"I usually would never spend $50 on a face cleanser, but I splurged because I absolutely love the way this feels when I'm using it to cleanse my face. It feels so soft and luxurious as it lathers up and gently but effectively cleanses. Also, a tiny bit a product goes a long way with this, so even though the cost is high it should last a while. I docked a star off because it claims to help combat acne, but I honestly haven't see those kind of results and am not sure how it would since it doesn't have any of the typical acne fighting ingredients.",0
I've always been curious about DE products and decided to buy this kit for myself to try a few items and it did not disappoint! My skin is loving the Protini moisturizer and Slaii was my first time using that type of cleanser and I'm obsessed. Would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try this brand.,1
"I’ve always enjoyed Gucci lipsticks. This is the first sheer one I’ve tried. It’s a beautiful shade, a little beyond YLLB by itself. It goes on sheer. I like to layer it over Fenty’s “So Chili” lipstick from the Snow Daze set. I especially like the very feminine and retro flowered cap. Reminds me of lipsticks from decades ago. If there is any odor it doesn’t bother me.",3
"I've always struggled with dry patchy skin on my nose and on my forehead right between my eyebrows. Until I found this product, I would either just not use powder or not powder those parts and blot away oil and creases as they came. this is the FIRST powder product I have EVER tried in 7 years of wearing makeup that hasn't made me hate my skin. It doesn't grab at my dry skin, it blurs my pores, and it lasts me all day with only one touch-up needed towards the end of the day. I'm not normally one to leave reviews but I'm genuinely so happy about this product that I can't not tell everyone how much I love it.",0
"I've always wanted to get one of the NUDESTIX sets but usually one or two of the colours didn't appeals me. But this one I could see myself using every single shade and I do. The nudies glow in Half Moon is a great highlighter. At first I was apprehensive about it because I thought it was a holographic highlighter, but it's actually quite flattering and wearable day to day. \nBody language is a beautiful blush, it's great for everyday and I can see it being super versatile for every season. It would definitely work on a variety of skin tones and it's a great neutral blush to add to my collection.\nThe lip in secret keeper is a beautiful formula, it has a slight sheen to it and it's super comfortable. It's the perfect everyday pinky nude and it's surprisingly last long on the lips for being a more hydrating formula.\nThe Luminous magnetic eyeshadow colours are perfect for myself. Bright Eyes is a beautiful champagne taupe perfect for everyday. Night dweller is a beautiful green which I love green on myself, it's perfect for adding some depth if you want to go out or just want a bolder smokey eye. Prism is a beautiful iridescent purple which is just a really fun colour. What I love about this eyeshadow formula is you can apply it directly from the stick blend the edges with a brush and it stays all day oh, and it doesn't crease.\nThis kit is amazing if you want to try out a bunch of formulas from NUDESTIX , it's a really great bang for your buck and I genuinely enjoy every single product in this kit. I highly recommend.",1
"I've always wanted to try Benefit's brow products, so this was perfect. And I understand why they're stables in people's collections. The product make your brows look very natural, and are very long wearing. Very pleased with this bundle.",4
I've been a fan of the Supergoop sunscreen setting spray and the sunscreen oil. When I started my search for sunscreen this year I couldn't find either of these in-store but a Sephora rep recommended this product so I bought it and have been using it since early Spring. I have to say I REALLY like it! As a darker skinned woman I'm always picky about my sunscreen products because I don't like the pasty or greasy feel and the grey/white cast they can leave behind. This Supergoop Everyday sunscreen works great for me and it works in my daytime skincare routine. It's a lightweight formula that absorbs easily and doesn't interfere with my makeup at all. It's made for face & body but I only use it on my face. I'm definitely going to stick with it for the summer. I highly recommend it!!,2
"I've been a long time lover of all things skinfix since discovering them about 4 years, so when I saw they came out with a new eye cream with new packaging, I had to test it out. I love that this eye cream is safe to use all around the eye and it's a clean brand at Sephora.",2
"I've been buying this serum on and off for about four years now and there is a noticeable difference in my skin when I stop using it. I have oily combo skin that is prone to breakouts, particularly along my jaw, and continued use of this serum improves skin texture and clarity. I'm not saying it is a miracle worker for pimples, but it certainly helps reduce the redness and then lightens the scarring afterwards. To be fair, I have not tried other products for dark spots but this has been working well for me regardless.",0
I've been dreaming of a mascara that does exactly what this does. Lift and Define!!! Thats all I needed and wanted from a mascara and all I could ever find were a combination of volumizing ones. Thank you Benefit your products rock!,1
I've been eyeing fussy for a while now and when I saw Fenty released a holiday set with it included I knew I had to try them all.  I'm absolutely obsessed with every.single.one! They're all gorgeous colors and I think they will work on any skin tone. They're all so wearable and comfortable on lips too. I'd say a couple of them have a bit more glitter in them but not too much that it bothers me. If you're looking for a cute stocking stuffer or christmas gift for a friend this would be a huge hit!,0
"I've been getting these small blemishes on my forehead and chin that have been bugging me so much. I went to Sephora and one of the ladies recommended this mask. The massage activated color gimmick was not a sell off for me but it does help to know how long to massage for. This actually worked though. I've noticed a significant difference after the first use and will definitely buy the full size. It would help if they had better instructions though. Most masks I buy tell you whether your skin should be damp or dry before applying it and how to rinse it off (with a sponge or splashes, temperature of water, etc.) I have redness and sensitive skin. I was fine with this. I did feel a little sting around my eyebrows at first but it didn't last. I left it for like 12 minutes because I was watching something on YouTube and completely forgot about it. It wasn't irritating or uncomfortable. People have reviewed how its hard to take off.  I didn't find it hard at all. Also if you have tried the Origins pink clay mask. The consistency is similar to that but this one gave me immediate results after the first use so I prefer this one.",2
"I've been hearing about all of the benefits to taking a collagen supplement.  So I was thrilled when HUM Nutrition sent me a free sample to try.  While I do like the fact that this is something that dissolves in water, it takes almost 10 minutes for that to occur.  So I found it a bit difficult to get in a routine with taking this.  Also, the taste wasn't my favorite....it has that stevia aftertaste that I just don't love.  What I ended up doing was just using about 4 ounces of water and then chugging it down ;) As far as skin benefits, I honestly haven't seen a huge change yet but will continue taking to see.  All-in-all, this was just OK for me. For the price, I think there are better options out there.",1
"I've been in love with SuperMud since I first tried but much to my chagrin GlamGlow is so expensive. I was so happy to see this set, not only do you get a FULL SIZE SuperMud, you also get three other products including the toner I've been wanting to try. Mine just arrived yesterday and I haven't used it yet but I'm estatic to have gotten 4 products for $4 less than a full size SuperMud... all smiles!!",1
"I've been living for this! I would say this definitely lives up to its claims for visible plumping (and no discomfort), softens, preps for lip color and conditions. This feels great on and I love how my other lip products look over this. Price is reasonable for what you get. The only thing is since my lips are super dry in winter I think this could still do a better job at moisturizing so this was not the be all end all product for my chapped lips but definitely lives up to other claims!",1
"I've been looking for a coral that wasn't super duper loud (weird but true). This is perfect for my cool toned skin and is a great color to finish summer with! The formula is pleasantly vanilla scented, is comfortable all day, and is pretty long wearing.",0
"I've been looking for a good powder that will actually stay on and match my hair perfectly, and this powder in walnut does all of that. its pigmented just enough where you can build up if you want bold brows, but also enough to quickly fill in brows for a natural look. amazed at how quickly I can get my brows done with this stuff. not glittery when I put it on either which when I first saw it I thought I ordered a shimmery brown eyeshadow lol. glad I got my hande on it while walnut was still on sale and in stock",4
"I've been looking for a new serum for my dry lips ever since Sephora stopped selling Peter Thomas Roth UnWrinkle and tried this. I live at high altitude (near Boulder, CO) and struggle with chronically dry lips that even heavy lip balms and treatments, except PTR, didn't help.\n\nBefore bed, I put a bare scrape of La Neige Lip Mask on 1 index finger,  add a drop (about the size of a baby pea) of Fresh Sugar Lip Serum, mix them up with the other index finger and apply to my lips. This combo works even better than PTR. It completely softened a persistent rough area on the left side of my lower lip. \n\nIn the morning, I apply a thin 1/2""-long line on my finger and dab it on my lips, apply the rest of my makeup to give the serum  a chance to dry, then finish with lipstick/stain. \n\nIt definitely has improved the softness and comfort of my lips. I don't use more than a drop the size of a baby pea--never a full pump--so this is a very cost-effective option in comparison to PTR. \n\nI recommend Fresh Sugar Lip Serum Advanced Therapy without reservation. .",3
"I've been looking for a replacement for my discontinued Algenist genius White brightening essence serum. I like a multi Tasker with lightening properties; some areas of my face have darker patches on the jawline. This serum was successful at preventing my dark patches from showing up again. However it has exfoliating properties, so I can't use it in the morning under makeup. I will return to the Algenist Genius Ultimate Anti-Aging Vitamin C  serum or an Origins combo of Mega Dark Spot Correcting   Plantscription Anti Aging Power Serum, or a Perricone serum. I like Dr. Gross, but I use this product only at night, now.",2
I've been looking for a small cool toned palette for a while and this one is exactly what I wanted! I love the taupe color in this and the dark brown is great too the only problem I have is the shimmers aren't the best I mean they're good just not as much pay off as I'd like especially for the price but if you just want something simple and easy this is the perfect little palette for you,0
"I've been looking for products to help improve my skin so I can wear less makeup.  This product is now my main staple in my effort to eliminate my rosacea.  Even after the first night there was a noticable improvement in the redness on my cheeks and after the last 4-6 weeks I've noticed my complection has evened out nicely.  It doesn't claim to improve other blemishes, but it seems to have diminished some of my minor ones.  It also is very moisturizing without being too heavy.  It also works best if I use it every night.  I was using belif's Water Bomb, am & pm, which I LOVED and was reluctant to change, (but I still use belif for the daytime, especially now that the weather is warming up!)  But if I try to switch off at night,  my redness returns.  So now I use it every night except for the occasional overnight mask. But overall, a great product and cornerstone of my skincare regimen.  \nI also love their foaming face wash and I'm currently trying the eye 360° cream, but it's too early to make a call on that one.  ;) But loving this line so far!  :D",3
"I've been looking for something to fix my ""over Shellacked"" nails forever. I've tried Sally Hansen, Nail Envy, different oils - nothing works. But within just a few days of using this 2/3 times a day, I can see my nails coming back to life. Absolutely amazing product. Believe the 5* reviews!",3
"I've been loving using a facial oil instead of regular moisturizer for the past year. Previously my favorite had been the Emerald Facil Oil from Herbivore but I think this one is honestly better. Not only is is cheaper but I find that I need less to fully moisturize my face. Just 3 drops (about half of a full dropper) and I'm good to go. I like the scent too, not too strong but still pleasant. No need to reapply moisturizer throughout the day, just once in the morning is enough. I have combination skin leaning more towards the dry side so it's always a nice surprise when I find a moisturizer that gets the job done. Adds a cute healthy glow too :)",0
"I've been on a hunt to find a face oil to help me during this winter season and based on so many positive reviews, I assumed this must be the one!  After using it for 1 week I thought it was magic in a bottle.   By the second week it seemed the skin was basically still dry after a couple of hours...so I put on some more.  Now 3 weeks in my face feels scaly, dry and itch!!  What on earth is in this??? I honestly can't believe it!!  I have not changed anything in my face care routine but this....I was soooo confident that this is the one that I even purchased the 100ml bottle.   What a huge disappointment!",2
I've been searching for a good coverage foundation that looks natural and this is it. I love the way this feels so silky smooth. I find the shades to be quite dark and this was the lightest available. I really hope they don't discontinue this foundation!,3
I've been shopping around for a gentle cleansing face wash and I absolutely love Kiehl's. I have combination skin and I notice face cleansers either dry out my skin or make it super oily from stripping it. Kiehl's has reduced my breakouts and keeps my skin nicely balanced. You only need a tiny amount which makes it economical. It's just such a nice addition to your skin care routine. I would highly recommend this product.,1
I've been struggling with hormonal acne for about a year now - this is the first product I've found that actually HELPS!! I'm obsessed and will definitely be repurchasing. If you're considering giving this a try....DO IT!,4
I've been trying this primer for a few weeks now and so far I've really enjoyed it. I find it to be slightly hydrating and blurring but I do not find it to be brightening. I enjoy it and will continue to use it and I would recommend it to others. My only gripe is that the fragrance is a bit strong at first but it does dissipate. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,4
I've been trying to use this amount for lmthe last year. It dries my skin out if I use twice in a row and leaves my face very white. Neither love nor hate as it does it's job. Wouldn't buy again though.,0
"I’ve been using another HUM nutrition product and my experience was so good that I decided to give this one a try. The results show on your face and I noticed my sleep improved, I have a hard time falling asleep and I\nNoticed it got easier after i started taking it.\nI received this product as a free sample but the opinion is my own.",1
"I've been using a sample for a couple of days now, and the difference in applying after a regular eye cream is huge! \nMy age lines under my eyes look so much better... So rich, you don't have to apply it too much, so it's gonna last for a long time.\nDefinitely I'll buy it.",2
"I've been using first aid beauty for years. Mostly the face wash that comes with this set for redness and sensitive skin. I've been wanting to branch out and try their other products. I've been using the wash, gel, and pads for a few days and I already see and feel a difference. Highly recommend. I'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these sets as gifts.",4
"I've been using it for more than 3 months and I have seen no results.\nThis product does make your eyelids oily/greasy so maybe it does not absorb well.\nI really wanted to like this product, it does hydrate and have a nice texture though so I gave it 3 stars.",0
"I've been using Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer for more years than I can remember and was a huge fan of the former version of this product. This new formula was a huge disappointment. It feels heavier, looks and feels chalky, the color isn't quite right, and it makes my skin feel dried out. I returned it and grabbed the Nars tinted moisturizer instead (hopefully it works out better). It's too bad Laura Mercier changed the formula.",2
Ive been using pharmaceutical-grade vitamin c products for more than a decade.  this beats most of them both in efficacy and (a serious beating) in price.  the tackiness goes away quickly if indeed it is being used correctly.  i.e.  don't just pile it on right after using another product and allow it to sink in at least 1 minute before following with moisturizer or sunscreen.,2
"I've been using the Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask in combination with the Moisturizing Eye Bomb at night and my skin has never looked better. I wake up with glowing, health, hydrated and plump skin. Highly recommend!",3
"I've been using the Eye Bomb in combination with the Sleeping Mask at night and my skin has never looked better. I wake up with glowing, healthy, hydrated and plump skin. Wonderful eye cream! I highly recommend it! The Aqua Bomb Sleeping mask works wonders as well!",3
"I've been using the original Urban Decay all nighter for several years and decided to give this one a try when  it came out. I was so pleasantly surprised! It is ever so slightly less drying than the original which is exactly what I wanted. It does a fantastic job of keeping your makeup in place all day, like the original, just looks a little more natural. I'm buying this one from now on.",3
"I've been using these for over 10 years now! I always get compliments on my flawless skin, with even estheticians thinking I'm wearing make-up when I'm not. The moment I stop using these wipes I notice my skin isn't as radiant and smooth, so they stay in the arsenal. Tip: cut the wipes in half! If you're just using on your face/neck half a pad is plenty. I only use a full one when I'm doing my entire face, neck, and decollate.",0
I’ve been using these foundation sticks since the 90s. I have 4 or 5 different shades that I rotate based on season and my tan level. Color range is great. I never liked goopy fluid foundation and these sticks are so user friendly. Worth every penny.,2
I’ve been using this a little while and can see a noticeable difference. It does have a slightly odd smell but it goes away quickly and isn’t a big deal. I did receive this product for free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.,0
I've been using this concealer for 2 weeks now and I really like the coverage it gives. When I first got it I thought it would be light coverage but I find this gives me medium-full coverage under the eyes. I have also tried it as a spot concealer and it does the job just fine.,1
I've been using this concealor for years now. It's the best one I've ever used. I like applying it with a wet beauty blendor. It's perfect if you want a more full coverage look. I have acne / scars and it covers it perfectly. I use this and powder over it and I don't look cakey. I work long hours and I feel like my face looks the same throughout the entire day (I'm talking 12 hours).,0
"I've been using this every other night or so for about two weeks and it has TRANSFORMED my skin. I'm prone to acne, and because I'm super fair, blemishes leave red marks that last forever, so my skin is always blotchy and even. Since I started using this, my skin tone has totally evened out! I was trying a sample of this and was so amazed at the almost immediate results that I quickly went back to purchase it. I also bought the Tatcha C serum because if it does even a fraction of what this mask does, I want it on my face. Looking at the reviews, this obviously doesn't work for everyone, but I recommend at least trying it if you have any issues with uneven skin tone. I can't believe this has just been sitting there in Sephora all this time - wish I would have tried it earlier, but I'm so, so glad I finally found it. I feel so much more confident without makeup now!!!",2
"I've been using this eye cream for a while now, and I truly love it. It goes on so smoothly, and really softens my under eye area. It's not think or tacky, just smooth and creamy. And a little goes a long way!",1
I've been using this for 5 months and it's become a must-have product for me. It doesn't dry out my skin or break cause break outs. It's super fast to apply and I no longer feel the need to wear foundation. I wish I had discovered this years ago!,4
"I've been using this for 5+ years and love it. A little goes a long way and it's perfect for all skin types. My esthetician recommended it and I use it every day, multiple times in the winter when my skin is drier. Lightweight, fresh, and perfect for under makeup or a midday boost.",1
"I've been using this for about 2 months once a day and I really like it (I've gone through one bottle). it works at night or under makeup for day. it doesn't make my face greasy or feel funny - the texture is a bit like a jelly serum, but it isnt weird at all like some of the reviews say. it goes on nicely and dries fast! I can't tell if it is curing my wrinkles this soon since that would be a miracle, but my face looks smoother than normal",4
"I've been using this for about 5 years. Once in awhile I get budget conscious and try to switch to a more inexpensive cream and can see a difference im days and immediately switch back. I have notoriously dry skin that tends towards milia (those lil white bumps), this gives me perfect light moisture, no milia or breakouts. love this stuff",3
"I’ve been using this for about 9 weeks and have noticed my lashes are a lot longer than they were when I started. I was religiously getting eyelash extensions and filled every 2 weeks (I am a heavy sleeper so they were harsh on my natural lashes).  I decided I needed a bit of a break and instead of getting Latisse (what I’ve done in the past) I opted to try something a little more “natural” with its ingredient list. It didn’t work as good as Latisse for the quantity/volume of my lashes, but as I stated before I noticed the biggest difference in the length. Overall if you need to see dramatic results fast, I would opt for the Latisse, but this is a nice alternative with softer results. I received the product free or complimentary for sampling purposes.",0
I've been using this for about a month and have noticed a huge difference on the darkness and puffiness under my eyes. If I miss it before sleeping I'll notice in the morning that my under eye area is puffier. I also use this under my concealer and notice less creasing.,1
"I've been using this for about a week and a half now and I really like it!! It has a really amazing texture. It's so so creamy! It feels so nice and hydrating. Not sure if I would enjoy it as much in the summer because of the humidity where I live but it's great for winter! And I do find it slightly brightening, which I love!! I get freckles under my eyes more than anywhere else so a good under eye spf is a must for me! It's also non irritating ❤",4
"I've been using this for about a year now when my skin gets dry and flaky or has a weird allergic reaction/flare up. I put it on at night and wake up to calm, hydrated skin. It's so soothing. I can even put it around my eyes and it's completely non-irritating (I have really sensitive skin) This is just the perfect thing and a little goes a long way. I never want to be without it.",4
I've been using this for a couple of months now and I absolutely love this oil. My skin feels so hydrated after using it and I feel like it's been helping my skin texture. I don't like using it in the morning as it does take a little while to settle in but love it as a night oil.,1
"I've been using this for a few months, my skin has never been better, and I credit AT LEAST 50% to the addition of this moisturizer.   I think I'm becoming a Murad covert.   I received a deluxe sample of the hydro essence with my full size and that had been a nice addition as well.  Well worth the price.",2
"I've been using this for almost a year now and it's changed my skin for the better. I have an oily nose but dry everywhere else and this moisturizer works perfectly for both. My skin looks visibly healthier now. Soft yet firm, and a slight glow. It's my holy grail.",1
"I've been using this for a month as my toner for 7 skins (patting on up to 7 layers of a hydrating toner) and it's been wonderful. I worried the milkiness might be an issue with so many layers, like it might leave a film on my skin, but it's been wonderful. I've never felt so hydrated. My skin is eczema prone and extremely dry, and this has been calming and my redness is gone.",2
"I've been using this for a week now with the Bioassance peptide eye gel and I seriously cant believe how much better my under eye crepiness is. I have tried almost every brand on the market and nothing seemed to help. These 2 eye products will forever be a staple in my routine, I cant wait to see the future progress.",4
I've been using this for years now because it does exactly what it claims to do:  brighten and depuff.  I'm a shift worker and bouncing between days and nights are wreaking havoc on my body but I look fresh and rested thanks to this stuff!,1
"I've been using this mask every night instead of my night cream and it really does help my skin look nourished and glowy the next morning. I adore the scent too. the mask is thick but not uncomfortable. added bonus that it really calms my skin down from being in awful dry winter weather all day, I also have never broken out from this mask despite using it every night for the last 3 weeks. I was a bit hesitant due to the relatively high price but the discovery kit totally sold me on it. completely worth the price. will be repurchasing for sure.",4
"I've been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now. I love how creamy and hydrating it is. I do not have any facial lines/wrinkles to speak of, so I cant speak to the anti aging properties. I would recommend this based on how emollient it is and how soft it made my skin feel. I am giving it 4 stars because it is quite fragranced. If the fragrance was removed I would give it 5 stars. \n\nI received this product complimentary for my unbiased review.",4
"I've been using this over the last few days and I think it's been doing a good job so far. my skin feels hydrated and soft. the only con I would say is the smell. it has a floral scent, which are not my favorite, but nothing crazy. its expected with higher end products.",1
"I've been using this palette for over a month now, and every time, I think I should have returned it after the first few uses. The blushes are very dry feeling and the pigment is very strong. I use a very light touch when applying blush and even then, it's too much color. I find I have to wipe it down after application so it looks like a gentle flush of color. I have other NARS blushes including the always-perfect Orgasm blush and I never have issues with the application. A good blush should allow for blending and building color, this one has me reaching for a tissue to wipe it down every time.",4
"I've been using this powder for several years. I loved it. I'd put it on in the morning, over primer, and it lasted all day. The finish, a beautiful matte. I thought it was just the packaging and shades they changed several months ago. No, the formula is definitely different. By noon, I look like I have no foundation on. Beyond disappointed with KVD now. I'll still buy the tattoo liner, until they decide to botch then, but I'm done with this powder.",3
"I've been using this powder for the last 2 years and love it - by far the best coverage and it doesn't break out my face or clog pores. \n\nBut this last one I received has a strange aloe smell to it.... anyone know if this is indicative of a bad batch or is it a formula change? It seems to perform the same,  but wondering if I should exchange it. It's in the new packaging by Clinique, so I don't think it would be expired.",2
I've been using this product faithfully for 6+ months & I people have been telling me I look 4 to 5 years younger than my actual age. The reviews complaining about the pili that can form are true but it shouldn't be a deterrent in how amazing this product is when it comes to firming and hydrating the skin.,4
I've been using this product for about 1 week now. I haven't noticed a difference in my dark under eye puffiness but I did get an allergic reaction today. Redness under the eye where I applied the gel. I'm not sure what caused this especially since I've been using it daily for a week.,2
"I've been using this product for about 6 months now and it has not helped at all I was looking forward to trying out a new Essence for my skin but I am disappointed. I was previously using the Kiehl's Essence which improved dullness, my pores, skin texture, and made my skin look healthy. I will definitely be returning to the Kiehl's Essence for my skin.",1
"I've been using this product for about a year and love the results. I use Retin-a at night, so I use this in the morning after toning and eye serum, and before my moisturizing sunscreen. It does take time to absorb, so if you're applying foundation, morning application might not be for you. I am so happy with how my skin is these days I don't generally wear foundation anymore. This product has helped even out my skin tone and leaves me with glowing skin. Another win by The Ordinary.",2
"I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now. I like the packing , love the pump, and I love the way it makes my skin feel. As far as any correcting, I haven’t seen much of a difference. \nI do also like the price point. You get a lot of perfect.",0
"I've been using this product for almost a year now. I've not noticed a difference in dark spots or large pores. It's hard to tell if my fine lines fading are from this serum or my moisturizer. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin so there's that but it's just not worth the money to me. Also, the bottle is horrible. Sometimes the pump works, sometimes it doesn't. And it's nearly impossible to get the last bits out of the bottle. I have to leave it upside down for a day then whack it against my palm to get the rest out. The glass bottle looks pretty but is impractical. I'm currently looking for a cheaper dupe.",2
"I've been using this product the past 2 weeks and it has improved my skin dramatically. it has reduced the size of my pores and reduced my redness. I received this as a complimentary item, but it has truly changed my skincare routine for the better. my skin thanks drunk elephant.",4
"I've been using this serum for about a week, every other night. It will take a little more time to see results but it seems to be working well as I've had no breakouts or adverse reactions since using. I have oily skin with large pores, some dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I love that this serum has a very mild scent. I use about 5 drops and that's plenty for my face (one drop on both cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin), since it's oil based it spreads easily and a little goes a long way. It sinks into my skin nicely and doesn't leave an oily residue. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  I don't have sensitive skin but it seems it would be good for those with sensitivity issues since it has clean ingredients. I will definitely finish this bottle but doubt I would pay full price for this. I'm sure it's worth it, but out of my price range.",2
I've been using this serum for about a week now and I'm definitely loving it. I have pretty dry skin and I've definitely felt like my skin is softer and more plump than normal. I cant wait to see how this product works with longterm use.,1
"I've been using this serum for the past three weeks just to try something new as I had never used a serum before and didn't want to splurge right away. I was worried about this breaking out my skin at first, but it was quite the opposite. I've actually had far less breakouts since using the serum. I just wish that I didn't need to use so much to cover my face. I think that causes the need to purchase sooner and then you aren't really saving much money in the end. The consistency does feel watered down as many others have mentioned. The smell is tolerable though and it does not make my skin burn as I have very sensitive skin. I would recommend it for others as a starting point.",4
"I've been using this sunscreen for about 2 weeks and so far, really like it. I have sensitive/combination skin and it has not caused any breakouts or excess oiliness. It's slightly moisturizing, which has been great for my drier skin this winter.\n\nIt's a thick formula but applies really smoothly and soaks in nicely, like a moisturizer. It does not have a strong sunscreen smell at all and I have not noticed any white cast. I let it soak in for a few minutes before applying makeup and it works well under makeup. I only experienced pilling once, when rubbing an area of my neck, but you have to rub pretty hard before it'd happen. (I apply most of my makeup with a beautyblender)\n\nOverall, this is a really solid mineral sunscreen, which is what I was looking for.",1
I've been using this thick and creamy moisturizer on my dry skin and cellulite on my legs and I love it. \nI do wish the scent wasn't so strong. I've been putting this on after showers and I've found that whatever clothes I put on smell like the lotion days later. I'm sensitive to strong scents and if I get any of this near my face it starts to give me a headache.,1
"I've been using this toner for several years now. I love the smell, it's so clean & earthy. Great for sensitive skin and issues with redness. I use it nightly after cleansing my makeup off.\nOnly 4 stars because the first time I bought it I thought it was actually lotion! Might not be a bad idea to have it in a semi transparent bottle haha.",1
"I’ve been using this tool for about 3 months, daily in the morning, and have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin tone and texture. My only disappointment is that the replacement heads were out of stock for 2 mos and I was starting to consider returning the device. I just received replacement heads last week from the Stackedskincare site as they still were not available at Sephora. Hopefully availability of the replacement heads won’t be an issue in the future because I really like this tool.",3
"I've been waiting for this to come back in stock. The good genes lactic acid treatment is amazing and considering a 1oz bottle goes for $105 on its own, paying just an additional $11 to get the rest of these products is an amazing deal.",1
"I’ve been wearing It Cosmetics CC cream in light for years and wanted to try something new but this definitely is NOT it. This is SO DRYING! It really emphasized texture and dry areas I didn’t even know I had! The most shocking thing however is that it is so HEAVILY FRAGRANCED! Oh my goodness ...I smelled it just opening the little bottle and once I had it on my face I kept thinking, “ what is that horrible smell?” and realized it was MY FACE!",3
"I've been wearing this since junior year of high school. I'm twenty-nine now. I seriously cannot find a better mascara than this. Every time I stray to try something different I just end up going back to this goodie. It always makes me look like i'm wearing falsies if I build it up. Never flakes up, never gets super hard on the lashes.",1
"I've bought at least 6 foundations in the past few months looking for something with medium coverage and a dewy, radiant finish.  I've spent up to $80 for a product at a time and was having no luck.  I'm 44 and am having a hard time finding something that doesn't settle into fine lines.  I just returned another product to Sephora and decided to try this.  So extremely happy that I did because it's perfect and looks beautiful.  I've tried it with both Hourglass setting powder, and bareminerals (both illuminating veil and original veil).  It looks best with the original veil and my bareminerals primer.  I applied with the Sephora pro foundation brush and then used a beauty blender to finish the blending and wow, so happy!! I've never tried a Tarte foundation before but this is one I'll purchase again.",2
"I've come to a phase in life where even creamy lipstick looked a bit ""too much"" and most glosses either looked ""too little"" or bizarrely shiny.\n\nThis stuff hits the sweet spot of colour and shine!  It is a bit sticky, but I forgive it because it is so amazing.\n\nIt does tingle a bit, not very much and not for long.  Pleasantly tastes like peppermint.  Product size is quite generous.  Colours are gorgeous.  Stays put and does not travel or bleed.\n\nIf you've been on the fence, seriously, try them.  I have both Cherry Flip and Kir Royal.  Both might look a bit daunting, but they are not. \n\n Cherry looks very red on screen, comes out of the tube disappointingly pink and applies in two coats somehow as a clear, clean, apple red, and looks rather natural.  What sorcery is this?  I don't care, tbh.  It's an amazing colour, and as a bonus, my teeth look extra white when I wear it.  I never thought I'd pull off red again - but I can.\n\nKir Royale looks like you'd be morphing into Goth mode (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's a lovely clear purple-pink colour.  One coat on me is more pinkish, two coats is a deeper purply-pink with high shine but no ""brightness"" to the pink if that makes sense.  It's not like a purple or pink ""pop! here's my lips"" kinda of deal.  It still remains very wearable, and you just look nice. Kir also kicks down to a cool neutral when I combine it with a different brand's peachy colour.  Once I run out of that, I will replace with something from this Buxom line because I assume they blend.\n\nEventually, I will own all of these.  I haven't touched another lip product (except that one blending mode and Buxom's Dolly) since I started Kir Royal.  When I ran out, I added Cherry Flip and I'm SO glad I did.  I won't wait to run out, though.  I want them all.",2
"I've enjoyed this product on my journey to finding ""the perfect primer."" I do feel that it works differently depending on what climate you live in. When I live in Las Vegas for half of the year it works the best there (DRY). When i live in Nashville the other half i notice a little more creasing (HUMID).",0
"I've got a lot of deep scarring on the face from a combination of late chicken pox and hormonal cystic acne, and while my skin condition is clear now, I've done everything from PRP to laser and chemical peels for my skin to little avail.  The Dr. Dennis Gross peel pads have been a lifesaver, and I'm super thankful for my fateful encounter with a brand specialist at Sephora Guildford who was comfortable enough showing me his personal scar journey and recommending this product.  I know there's a lot of skepticism about the strength and efficacy of the peel pads, but they definitely provide a dramatic boost to your skincare routine that I feel if I ever have to budget them back out.  If your skin is typically non responsive to medi-spa procedures, which mine has been in the past, this really pushes the results to the next level and can help you gain ground on skin repair if you've struggled with that in the past.",0
"I've had a few of these tubes, but never really got into using them. I started applying before bed to see what would happen. Amazed to find it still on and my lips in perfect condition upon awakening. I used to tend to chap in any weather but not anymore. My favorite is the Lavender. They go on pretty colorless. I love what I thought the Lavender would look like. The Clear is delicious. I am pretty blown away by how well this product does its job. Just hope whatever Bite is replacing it with is very similar.",2
"I've had this brush for years and years and years ... I use it every day, I travel all the time with it, despite its size.  I can't be without it.  You can drop a very small amount of foundation on the tip and spread it extremely well with this brush.  I can get everywhere with this brush, even under and around my eyes -- I just close them and go gently and softly.  I also use every kind of motion, borderline abusing this thing and I SWEAR TO GO this brush has not yet lost a single bristle (that I've ever seen) and its been like 10 years.  I keep thinking I should buy a backup in case they stop making this but I still don't need to!  I wash this in the shower with my face wash and the Sephora brush-washing silicone pink ribbed pad and then let it air dry -- but I don't wash it often enough because I hate not having it ready whenever.  I LOVE THIS BRUSH.  Totally worth the investment.  I wish they'd make a MINI VERSION?!?!",3
"I've had this powder since last September 2018 and it is now July 9th 2019 when I'm writing and I'm already reordering it since I literally just ran out. I have a pretty good knowledge now of this powder. when I first got it I used to set my undereye concealer with it and my entire face. I have normal to dry skin, it's more normal during the summer and drier during winter. This powder is really expensive which is one reason I decided half way through the jar that I was going to try to find something else to bake with because I was using alot. I now use huda beauty to bake with but I still use this for the rest of my face. This powder sets everything in place for an entire day and when I used it for my undereyes I absolutely loved it. I love to bake with this but it takes alot to do so. It is not matte or flat matte, it is a lovely natural satin type finish with no shimmer, no glitter or anything radiant like that just literally a lit from within glow. It leaves your skin soft. You can even skip the setting spray with this because it's really that beautiful of a finish and isn't powdery looking. It doesn't dry your skin out and it makes your makeup last for a good solid 14 hours at least. I used to not set this at all with setting spray, now I do with the glow recipe spray because of the huda beauty I use which I also recommend for baking. I also like to use this  hourglass powder to use the buffing technique which is my absolute favorite thing to use this powder for. it just meshes everything together in such a beautiful way. If there's one setting powder on the market that I would say get it's this one. I think all skin types could benefit from this beauty. the only setting powders I have ever repurchased in my entire life is this hourglass powder for all over setting powder and buffing and the huda beauty for baking. I swear, it's like a match made in heaven but out of the two I would go with this one. as I said before due to price is why I purchase both.",1
I've had this product for around a month and I feel that it is safe to say that this and a lot of Tatcha's products will be a staple in my beauty routine. I use this every night after my Tatcha cleanser and it has been amazing. I love the way it foams and I feel like it really does help to fully cleanse my skin. The only gripe I have is that when I pour the product it gets some of the powder gets stuck in the lip and it builds up but that is not enough of a reason to not love this product.,0
"I've literally never written a review before but this product has worked such wonders for me that I need to write this. I've battled with acne from the onset of puberty into my adult years, have very sensitive combination skin and moderate rosacea. I've tried EVERYTHING and nothing has ever worked this good for me. My pores that were once large and visible are now very small, my redness has reduced and my skin is CLEAR after only 2 weeks of use. I use 4 drops, morning and night after using the fresh soy facial cleanser and I'm so happy with the results. If you're tempted to try this but scared by the price, just do it. It's worth every penny.",0
I've never been anything but totally satisfied with Anastasia eyeshadows and this was no different. For the price point it's definitely worth it; I've had it for over a month now and I use it almost every day because the colors are super wearable and blend out easily.,0
I've never been good at concealing/highlighting and at my age I wasn't really driven to learn. Then I stumbled across a video on youtube (thank you autoplay) with a woman who used this. It looked so easy and such beautiful results that I went out and bought it. I absolutely love it and will not be without it going forward. I dab it on with a brush and let it sit for a few seconds to dry up just a bit and then pat it in with my finger. I am stunned by the brightening effect.,3
"I've never had one of those expensive jade rollers or anything, but it does feel really nice and it's cheaper. I don't see why it wouldn't do the same thing. I gave it as a gift to my mom and she loves it. She uses it every night.",4
"I've never left a review on Sephora, so that alone should tell you how amazing this product is. \n\nI struggle with acne due to PCOS and have been on ever medication in the book (save for accutane). \n\nBut NOTHING has worked like this. If I had known it would work overnight, I would have taken before and after photos. \n\nNot only have I not had a single cystic acne pimple in the last week I've been using this, but my face is way, way less red. \n\nI still have little baby white heads, but they're fading quickly. My skin looks smoother and is even glowing! \n\nI have super sensitive skin and eczema on my face, and this has only helped. My eczema isn't as flared! \n\nI cannot recommend this product enough.",4
I've never used a brow product other than a tweezers and an eyebrow brush.  I bought a trial size of  this based on the recommendation of the associate who waxed my eyebrows.  I quickly purchased a full size as this is an amazing pencil.  The ultrafine point is great for precise strokes and the spoolie is the best out there.,2
I've never used an essence before and I love how hydrated and radiant my skin became after about a week of use. I also like that there is no fragrance. Left my skin feeling hydrated and plump like a peach!,0
"I've never used a night cream quite like this before. The texture is unusual... whipped but thick, moisturizing but not wet? Almost like marshmallow fluff combined with a facial oil.  It's very unique, and a little goes a long way. I love the way it keeps my skin soft but doesn't feel gooey or goopy. Great for overnight moisturizing. Love it!",4
"I’ve never written a review before, but when I saw the rating I felt compelled. This is a mainstay 5 star product. At the time I’m writing this review it’s at 4.3 stars....BS. This deserves the full 5 stars easily. Smooths the skin leaving a glow unlike any other serum I’ve used. Not sticky and doesn’t interfere with makeup application. Truly leaves a perfect appearance.",2
"I've never written a review or returned a product but there's a first time for everything. I expected these to be mini, not micro. My set came with one JK and two Amazing Amal shades and one of those looked like Jaclyn Hill had produced it. The other was unstable in the component. The nude shade was waxy and patchy. I'm definitely going to be returning this set and I'm not going to be getting a full size from CT if this is indicative of her products. I'll stick with Bite, PML, and YSL.",3
"I've now purchased a second bottle of this product, so I think I am familiar enough with the results to give an informed review.  I love the results that I got from this oil.  I felt that with extended use, my skin was hydrated and glowy, which is what I expected.  The scent isn't the best, but I am okay with that because I prefer my skin care products to be non-fragranced.",2
"I've often found myself in Sephora looking at these as separate full size products and passing them by.  This kit is worth the money.  The scrubs are fine grained and very efficient, without drying your skin out.  The body oil is lovely and very moisturizing.  This aptly named kit is a wonderful method of self care. Glad I bought it.",1
"I've only been using it a couple of nights.  The first thing I noticed is the smell. Initially when you put it on it can be overwhelming, at least it was for me. I will say that the smell does go away after a couple minutes. I use a oil after I put it on for additional moisture.",4
I've only been using this.a couple days and I havent seen a ton of results but I can tell my lashes are getting stronger. On my right eye my lashes look like where broken and just not as long as the left and I can see a difference when I put mascara on this morning. I also love that this formula does not irritate my eyes like other lash serums do. This is my new go to product for lash and brow serum.,4
I've only used this 6-7 times but it does give me a nice bright face and wears well under makeup. I'm enjoying the texture as well! It is a little pricy and I probably wouldn't reach for it often if I did pay for this. I will update this review if anything changes in my feelings!,0
"I've owned several of these in different shades and really liked them. Great neutral colors, feels good on the lips. Then I opened my latest one, and the crayon fell right out of the holder. Never happened with previous Lippies, so I put it back in and pushed down a little, The crayon is only about an inch long. It fell out again the next time I used it, and I got smart and made sure I opened cap side up, but the crayon was stuck inside the cap. It was a big mess, and when it fell on the bathroom floor we were done. I returned it and tried another, hoping that one was defective. Nope. Same thing happening again. Is Tarte putting thinner crayons in to save money? I expect more from a $24 lip crayon.",3
I've purchased this plenty of times and plan to continue! This gently exfoliates my skin without irritation. Leaves my skin so smooth and it's so quick (and grossly satisfying seeing all your dead skin) and effective.,4
"I've really been enjoying this palette.  It's versatile and long lasting. I use the Nars eyeshadow primer and my shadow lasts 16 hours with no creasing, fading or transfer and I have older hooded eyelids. I would highly recommend and I own many many eyeshadow palettes.",3
I've really enjoyed this product. I have very finicky skin and this doesn't break me out or clog my pores. I put it on after exfoliating and my skin feels hydrated in the morning. Can't beat the price point. I will be repurchasing.,0
"Ive received gift sets of this a few times over the years and finally decided to write my review. it's a decent moisturizer but don't be fooled. it smells like lubriderm and the ingredients just don't hold up to today's cleaner, savvy standards. not worth the hefty price tag.",2
"I've received this product from influencer for testing purposes and did not pay for this. However, this is entirely my own personal opinion on this product.\n Let me start with how hard it is to fully review any skincare product without using it consistently for at least a month or more. So I'm going to my best here with the time I've been given. \nPackaging: Cute packaging, kind of original till you open the lid and see that the top helps minimize waste as well as gives you a guide of exactly how much you should actually be using. Great idea since most don't realize they're only supposed to be using a small amount. \nTexture: this moisturizer feels so soft and luxurious like silk... you just want to dive your entire body in the jar. It's very lightweight but from what I've experienced, it's heavy enough to do the trick. \nResults: I can not say that I've noticed any difference in the elasticity of my skin, however, I don't think it's been enough time to notice anything drastic. I can say this, it leaves my skin feeling amazing! It does kind of remind me a little of the Tatcha Silk Cream (a little) and it preps my skin perfectly for makeup application. \nRecommendation: Yes, I would definitely recommend this moisturizer but not specifically for its anti aging claims as I'm not sure if it's actually affective for that yet but I'll be sure to update my review after using it for a proper amount of time to speak on that. \nPrice Point: I do think it's a bit pricey for a moisturizer but I also think it's worth it. I'm not one to put a limit on my skincare and makeup products..so far, this is worth the price! KIEHL'S Pure Vitality Skin Renewing Cream",2
"I've repurchased this moisturizer twice now. so I obviously like it enough to buy it again when it rains out.\n\nMy first bottle absolutely stunk.  The sour yogurt smell was intense.  My second and  bottles barely have a scent at all, but that's live probiotics for you.  \n\nAside from the scent, it's a pretty basic daytime moisturizer that works well on my very sensitive and acne prone skin.  The probiotics work to calm the skin, though, and do help to balance the bacteria on the skin (per my derm). It layers well with my other serums and sunscreens and is more moisturizing than the texture would lead you to believe.",2
I’ve seen so many honest reviews about this product and people posting about how wonderful and I was so skeptical till I tried it myself. Wow it’s incredible it makes such a difference in such a short amount of time. I absolutely love the thick creamy texture that absorbs so well. It’s perfect under concealer it doesn’t make it caked by the end of the day either. I put mine in the fridge because I love when it’s nice and cold. I’d definitely recommend this to friends and family.,1
"I've seen this one, but I never paid it much attention. I'm a huge fan of double cleansing and I love oil cleansers. This one just wasn't on my radar because I love the Tactha one so much. Recently I got it as a sample with a Sephora purchase. It sat there for a while because I wasn't interested, randomly one day I decided to use it. I was amazed, first off the texture is not too thick nor is it too thin. It is perfect and that makes it easy and convenient to use. It has this awesome scent and also this warming benefit that I can't really explain, it's calming. It does a great job getting the makeup off and it really feels like a cleanser more so than an oil ironically. I found myself using up all the samples I had and then I went out and purchased a mini bottle now I have the regular size bottle in my cart because I'm using the small all up. This is one of the best cleansing oils on the market, it's just as good as my tatcha and I use them both in rotation.",2
"I’ve shopped at Sephora for over a decade, and have never written a review before, but have been so surprised by how much of a positive change this has made in my skin that I wanted to share. I have sensitive combination that gets tight and dry as soon as the weather changes in the late fall/early winter. I’ve tried so many different products to try to add moisture to my skin, but nothing helps for more than a few hours at a time. I got this serum as part of the Sephora Soko to Tokyo sample box, and wasn’t really even excited about trying it. I gave it a chance, though, and was really surprised at how glowy and moisturized it made my skin look, and how long the effect lasts. No other product has done this for me — most sit on the top of my skin and never seem to actually sink in. I’ve been using it for several days now, and the tight, painful winter skin hasn’t come back.",2
"I've spent a lot of time deciding wich color to order...Red reviews, saw lots of swatches and pictures...Finally ordered Donatella... Donatella is GRAY, THICK AND DRYING...I look dead with this color on my lips...I gave it away..Remember...DONATELLA IS GRAY",3
"I've spent a lot of time searching for a vegan sunscreen that I can use on my daughters hair part. They both get burnt easily and won't leave sun hats on, and greasy sunscreen in the hair is a nightmare to wash out. You need to reapply every few hours but it's so easy and not messy!",1
"I've switched over to only clean and cruelty-free brands. Listen up: if you think your makeup is cruelty-free just because the packaging says so, think again. This brand is leaping bunny logo certified, which is the ONLY internationally recognized and regulated certification. People at Sephora almost never know this and will recommend brands with that PETA bunny logo which are NOT cruelty-free (the company basically has to sign a pledge to PETA--meaningless). Secondly, the clean verification helps a lot, but it's not exhaustive. Things like PEG compounds and talc are not on the list. If you wanna know more, visit Suzuki or EWG. I know this sounds elitist but I'm an academic and I take credible research very seriously. There are a lot of ingredients out there that people think are bad for you and actually aren't and vice versa. Do your homework. \nFor the review, this brand is a great clean and cruelty-free brand. The mascara isn't waterproof but still holds up well. I haven't had any raccoon eyes yet. There's no flaking or fallout at all. The thing I love most is the packaging and the brush. All of Ilia packaging is high quality and beautiful--all metal and glass. The mascara twists closed but has a clicking mechanism to let you know it's properly closed. The brush is not like a traditional brush with hairy bristles, which I hate. It's more of a flexible comb. Love it. Sephora has an amazing return policy so definitely try it! It's a bit pricey but not when you compare it to other high-end brands and when you consider that it's clean and actually cruelty-free... how can you not buy this instead?",1
"I've tested out this product on different areas of my skin and those of my teen daughters (who have absolutely no dry skin and always use a rotating brush to clean their faces).  On my chin and cheeks, I always have the balled up dead skin.  However, on my forehead and nose...nothing balls up.  My daughters can't get anything to ball up on their faces, but boy did it work on the bottoms of their feet! lol   I have stronger peeling serums, but prefer to grab this at least twice a week after washing/drying my face in the morning.",3
"I’ve tied numerous serums - La Mer, Clinique, Lancôme, Chanel, Origins and others.  This Aussie serum actually works AND is reasonably priced!!  My complexion is smoother, less acne and feels like I’m 20 again.  I am also trying to make the transition to all Clean beauty products, so I’m beyond happy that Edible Beauty ticks this box too.  Highly, highly recommend...in fact their travel set is my mother’s Christmas present this year.",1
I've tried a dozen face washes and this is the only one that's ever been able to eliminate my hormonal acne! It did take a while of consistent use but the results are so worth it. If you have stubborn acne I really recommend giving this a try.,0
"I've tried a few brands of foundations in the past, MUFE was my go-to for a while for the shade match, but I still didn't quite love it. Then I got a sample of this from Sephora, told my mua bff I think I really like it, and she got one for me because it's her go-to. I LOVE IT! Shade match is perf, buildable without feeling or looking heavy, I have combination skin and it neither dries out or adds oil, and it truly stays on for hours --it's even lasted through a sweaty dance class! I always prep my skin with face oil or moisturizer and a primer which furthers helps the foundation, and it's naturally pretty matte, but I set it with powder for extra security anyway.",4
"I've tried alot of vit. c serums and I've always come back to this one it's my 4th bottle. 2 were full size so it's really good, I also love the transforming night gel just as much. It really just makes my skin look so clear. the moisturizer is a little to light for me but I sometimes mix it with my face primer when I'm starting to run low lol",2
"I've tried a TON of mascaras..from Armani, UD, Too Faced, Lancome, Kush, etc etc. I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try. It's MESSY! I wasn't impressed, and definitely wouldn't recommend it. Perhaps a waterproof formula would be better (?)",3
"I've tried both Drunk Elephant Babyfacial, and now the PHAT glow mask and they are both similar products, but to my surprise, the PHAT mask is soooo much better. it smells better, it works better and it's more reasonably priced. I woke up the morning after my first use and my pores looked soooo much smaller, my breakout spots aren't completely clear but they look a lot better now and my skin feels softer. I am in love with this product and sooooo happy it came out and I gave it a try. will never go back to Drunk Elephant after this!",4
"I've tried every foundation sephora offers. There is nothing better than  one small drop of this and a small drop of the primer on a flat clean surface with a foundation brush. It's never cakey, covers everything but without it looking heavy. It offers perfect full coverage but without build up. Like you're wearing nothing. This foundation is magical.",4
"I’ve tried every mascara imaginable, but always come back to Lancome. The products just keep getting better. You can’t go wrong with any Lancome mascara. This is my second favorite. No clumping. Full lashes. A  all around.",3
"I've tried just about every primer out there, while managing to convince myself Tatcha was just too expensive, while steadily going through the less expensive primers one after another.. from all the commonly raved about primers, to super-budget friendly drugstore brands - all to no avail. None of them covered my pores, prevented my foundation from shifting, etc. I finally decided to splurge & purchased this primer, with a higher quality foundation & setting powder. Voila! My foundation no longer cakes around my nose or shifts in our awful Florida heat & humidity.. my makeup honestly looks as beautiful at 6PM as it did at 7AM when I applied it. I will never buy another primer. It's pricey, yes.. but it's literally the ONLY primer that hasnt allowed my foundation to cake or shift throughout the day. AND I no longer have the dreaded polka-dot nose.. completely covers my pores. Love, love, love it.",3
"ive tried literally every self tanner and this is better than loving tan which was my previous fav this gives a deeper tan and longer lasting color, i apply it with the large body brush from iconic london rather than a mitt",0
"I've tried many exfoliating peels but I have to say these are definitely some of the best one's I've ever used! I love that they're easy to use, they tingle a little bit but most importantly the next morning my skin was so soft and smooth without it feeling dry! they smell like apple cider vinegar obviously but I didn't mind it and would definitely keep using them!",0
"I've tried many other foundations and I've always found myself back to becca. it's literally the best foundation hands down! claims everything it does, especially, it being waterproof and has a natural finish to it. i only have to use A DOT and it applies evenly all over my face and neck full coverage so it does save me from buying every 3 months. \n\nThis foundation lasts me all day and I have to say, putting on my makeup looks fresh and nice but after I'm done work or running errands my makeup looks EVEN BETTER !! it's one of those foundations that looks better even after its applied for so long.\n\none downfall to this foundation would be the pricing though, it's way too high... one of the most expensive ones out there.",0
"I've tried more than my fair share of foundations over the years, everything from tinted moisturizers to full coverage, in powder, serum, stick and other formulations. This is the best foundation for my needs at this stage of my life. I use a dense brush to tap on and buff off. It blends in seamlessly, provides a light, dewy finish, and lasts all day with primer, a touch of powder, and setting spray. Is it worth the price? I suppose that is relative, depending upon one's budget and priorities. I think it is, but I am also glad that my shade is available in the smaller, less expensive bottle, since a little goes a long way and I don't do a full face every day. I recommend it, but as always, try a sample first to see if it works for you.",4
"I've tried samples of the original, and it made my lips soft and hydrated... I love mint so when this came out I had to get the full size. So far, 3rd night in a row and waking up every morning with dryer lips than before. I even put some on the back of my hand and my hand's skin got slightly flakey. Not sure if I got a bad batch.... or the mint is upsetting my skin, but I will need to return this unfortunately.",0
I've tried several brands of eye masks and many seem to do little more than act like a spa treatment.  This is the only brand I've tried that actually had results.  This was my first purchase from Erno Laszlo but I was impressed and would definitely recommend to others.,2
I've tried so many eyeliners and they usually smudge on me due to oily lids! but this has been holding up really well! my one complaint is the crayon that pairs great with the liner but runs out TOO quickly!!!,2
"I've tried sooooo many primers, but this made my makeup look perfect!!! Leaves a very smooth, airbrushed finish. Pores are gone. My oily skin was controlled pretty much all day, but left a beautiful glow to my makeup. Makeup was perfect even when I washed it off at end of day. It spread easily like a moisturizer onto my skin. A lot of primers tend to pill my makeup or make it look cakey, but this did nothing like that. Please never stop making this...my new holy grail!!!",4
"I've used A+ and Good Genes for a while, but wanted to try Luna.  Will know more after more use, but it absorbed quickly and my skin was very smooth.  I think this is a great deal, and will continue to purchase Sunday Riley products!",1
"I've used different sprays, all of which have been ok. This one I ordered because I was wanting to try something different. I read reviews and decided to go with this one. I work in a hot environment and this keeps my makeup in place ALL DAY!!! The spray nozzle is ok, not terrible or anything. I've used this, worked all day, I've come home, taken a nap and woke up with my makeup still in place!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE!!!! A side note, I do have very oily and dry skin and this keeps me shine free and doesn't dry out my face either!!!",2
"I've used foundation brushes before but loved the look of a well-bounced in foundation using a Beauty Blender. My problem is I am alllways in a rush and my husband is alllways waiting for me. I got this brush on sale after reading the reviews. I was in a hurry last week and slapped some Guerlain foundation on my face and reached for this brush - and a miracle occurred. I was outta there in NO TIME FLAT, and looking seriously way better than usual. Like the reviews say, it doesn't eat up your foundation, doesn't leave brush marks or anything of the sort - just quickly and beautifully buffs out the product so that it blends into your skin like you were born looking great. My mouth honestly hung open for just a moment. Why have I wasted all this time futzing with a BB when 8 swirls with this thing did it all??!?  *Also, the detail version of this brush is to die for. Game changer for me, also. It will be replacing my expensive WGoss brushes for blending concealer. I'm going to get a couple more of them right now - there's a lot to conceal...",3
"I've used just about every mascara under the sun, I've also been in the beauty industry for over 20yrs (did I really just admit that, eluding to my age? lol) sorry i digress.. this mascara is the bomb..2 quick coats, that's all you need, your lashes won't know what happened, they'll be looking for glue, and a strip of falsies.. not necessary beauties.. bang work the bad gals.. you'll be happy you did!",3
"I've used products from this brand's brightening line and haven't had any issue, but for some reason this kit gave me a horrendous skin reaction; which is odd because my skin has never been sensitive. I had also purchased and used a face mask from this line prior to using this kit but I can't remember the name. Maybe that was an error on my part? All I know is that my skin did not like one or all of these products. Within hours my face was extremely swollen and my skin was red, dry, and bumpy where I had administered the face cream. I really wanted to like these products but if a product forces you to go to the doctor.... that's not good.",4
"I’ve used serums most of my adult life, but I’ve heard great reviews on vitamin C serums so I was excited to try Kora Organics vitamin c serum. It left my skin not too dewy/wet and of course it helped with the dryness. I have added this to my daily routine but I’m not sure if I’ve recognized any changes to my skin but I may have to use it for longer than 3 days. \n\nI received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",0
"I've used the Lancome and the Doir primers - both of which I like but Milk's blew them out of the water. I do have full, long lashes but this curls them so well, so they look even longer. I didn't have an issue with clumping or anything. This also worked the best as far as leaving behind enough of a white base to make a bright blue mascara actually pop.",4
I've used this a few times already under my concealer and it really does help cancel out dark circles.  I love the brightness of gives my under eye. the texture feels like a cream moisturizer so it is very easy to apply.,1
"I've used this for 2 days now and really like it. Today was warm and I was out running errands and grocery shopping, kept my makeup fresh. I have extremely oily skin and have been using Too Faced Peach Perfect Mist. Tatcha Satin Skin Mist doesn't keep me as matte as this but sometimes I feel TFPP is too mattifying. I'll probably alternate using them depending on what my activities do and how warm the weather is. I use Tatcha Water GEL (not cream) and feel this is the perfect companion.",3
"Ive used this for a few months now as instructed and I do not think it is very effective as a Glycolic wash. The price is good and i reallllly wanted it to work, but not only is it ineffective (the pH isnt low enough), it also contains Sodium Laurel Sulfate which stripped my skin and was very drying. I felt that i had to over compensate in serums and moisturizers. I think if youre looking for an effective glycolic wash, talk to your dermatologist for their recommendation that doesnt contain SLS. You can also just use a regular SLS-free fash wash (drugstore brands!) and then apply an chemical exfoliant after for better results.",0
I’ve used this for years and it helps keep my breakouts to the minimum. It doesn’t dry out my skin or irritate it. I use it with my Clarisonic or Foreo cleansers every morning or night once a day or every other day depending on my skin. I love it and will continue repurchasing it.,2
I’ve used this for years but my experience with two of the wand tubes has been same: hard to get product out with wand and formula seems to separate/harder to mix and wand comes out oily. I may try another of tube option no longer available.,2
I've used this mask multiple times and haven't noticed any major improvement to my skin. Actually it kind of burns sometimes and I don't quite understand why as it isn't cooling and doesn't have acids in it. I wouldn't repurchase.,4
"I've used this product since November. It does play nicely under makeup, but didn't do much for disguising dark under eye circles. It also irratated my eyes. I thought it was seasonal allergies making my eyes red, but my eye irritation went away as soon as I ran out of this product. Will not repurchase.",1
I’ve use this for three weeks now and could see improvement with the crêpe paper-like skin under my eyes.   I have used a lot of products but have not used anything that has given me results like this. Money well spent!,3
"I've wanted to try this moisturizer for a long time and I finally had my chance. It is a great product, a little goes a long way, my skin is super soft and bright, but it's not worth the price. The smell is not great, reminds me of a 80 year old woman. You can get similar results with Drunk Elephant at a much better price.",1
"I waa excited to try this product, unfortunately I absolutely hated it. Its smell is so strong and unnatural. I have combination skin that's sensitive and this product badly irritated the it. Wouldn't recommend.",2
"I waited for weeks for this shade to get restocked. Totally worth it. The cream blushes from MILK fade on me pretty quickly, this doesn't. It's much more moist (without being greasy) than their other sticks too. It slips easily over my foundation and is there all day. Doesn't look like I'm wearing blush either - just a healthy pink flush. The other MILK sticks are also just too big for me to get through one before it goes bad. This is the perfect size and price",3
"I wanted a new cleanser. I shared with the consultant my regimine. I was intrigued when this was suggested. Kiehl's is a good brand and the cost was less than amount I paid for my previous cleanser. The first few tries, I loved it. I used it with my Clairisonic.  I liked the amount of lather for so little product. Then I noticed a stinging sensation about five days in.\n Yesterday, I felt the dry, patchy skin on the tops of my cheeks. Today, I returned the cleanser but after washing my face with my previous cleanser, I feel dry areas on my entire cheek area, above my brows and between my brows. I don't know what it was but this product wasn't for me.",3
"I wanted a new light coverage foundation because I didn't want to hide my freckles but wanted something to even out my skin tone. Although the Ilia is marketed as a medium coverage foundation, this still worked out great for what I was looking for. This isn't as runny as I thought it'd be and it was very easy to blend with fingers (my preferred method nowadays). I do need to tap it a bit with my beauty blender to make sure i didn't leave any streaks, otherwise, the application is smooth and seamless (plus the color is a great match!). I use just a little more than half a pump, which is enough for the amount of coverage i want. i don't do a second layer so i can't speak to how well it layers. \nI wouldn't say this foundation is radiant but it's definitely not matte. It has a very natural finish and sets well with powder. I normally wear my foundation for at least 14-16 hours and although it does fade a bit, it fades evenly and i don't notice significant patches on my skin. I really like that it never looks cakey and doesn't settle in certain areas of my face. \nThis is not a cheap foundation so i would only repurchase during Rouge sales (unless i'm in dire need of a new one). \nOverall, this was a great purchase, especially because I would like to start using brands that are cruelty free and because I like to support the smaller brands as well.",1
"I wanted a peel off mask and saw this in the store and thought this might be good purchase. I was wrong.  Mask came off in pieces (over 20), some of it I couldn't get off and had to use toner to get off.  I gave it two stars because some areas of my skin that I was actually able to peel off the mask were soft.",3
"I wanted something that worked for my dry/combination skin. I was hesitant to try this because it is scented, but I actually really like the fragrance. I love the buildable coverage and the glory but not greasy finish. It’s always a gamble ordering a new foundation online but I’ll definitely buy this again.",1
"I wanted the pink one but these are constantly out of stock. They are a bit pricey too. However, they are fairly pigmented and the shimmer side isn't over powering. I get the hype, but they definitely need a bigger color range and more stock. Maybe next year I'll be able to buy the pink and the rose.",1
"I wanted this to help with wrinkles and under eye darkness. It seemed to work to help puffiness. But it wore off about 1 hour later. It wasn't hydrating enough to last the day. I'm sure if I had waited the 10 days, I may have saw a difference. Also, there was a slight burning sensation.",2
I wanted to add a simple eye-cream to my routine...I don't have dark circles or puffiness but I noticed dryness under my eyes that wasn't going away by just using moisturizer. Previous to using this I tried an eye-cream which gave me slight milia...after that I was hesitate on trying another eye cream. I took a chance on this one and it's perfect...it gives my eye area the hydration I needed AND no milia. Plus I've been using it every morning and evening for almost two months...it's looks like I barely used the little jar!!!\nI would suggest this eye-cream for anyone needing some hydration and a little TLC for their eyes.,0
":( I wanted to like these brushes but truthfully you could save your money. honestly my colourpop brushes have waaaay better quality for a much better price point. of course my Sigma brushes are better too .. basically, save your coins unless you want a cute bag (that i love). Sorry, huge fan of Huda but not of these brushes.",1
"I wanted to like these much more than I did. I've been wanting to try Bite for a while and figured this was a great set to do so. I was really excited about all the colors, especially the nudes. Size wise they were a little smaller than expected, but I think my expectations were ""off."" They are adorable and the packaging is really nice! The consistency and pigmentation are very nice - creamy, smooth, opaque. However, the formula slides around a lot during wear and bleeds outside my lipline. And somehow, the colors pull slightly orange on me! I was so disappointed. They swatch beautifully on my hand, but on my lips, the nudes pull just a bit orange and it's not at all what I expected or wanted in color. I'm still keeping them and will try to play around with some different lip liners but not sure they're getting me hooked to buy more Bite.",2
"I wanted to like this. At first my skin felt smoother overnight. I started out only once a week, but it made my skin break out and peel, sting , and dry out. I can't use retinol or vitamin a, my skin is too sensitive for it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with sensitivity .",2
"I wanted to like this, for the price, but I just couldn't. It feels heavy and made my eyelashes stick together. I tried waiting until it dried and applying mascara and I tried applying mascara while it was a little wet, just to see if I could get it to work either way. Nope, it's not for me. I have eyelashes, so it is not like I need the primer. It seems like an unnecessary step for me and not worth the time. I gave mine away.",3
"I wanted to like this. I really did. But no matter what you do, nothing comes out, or such a tiny amount it's not worth it.\nThe smell is nice and the formula seems okay, but sadly the roll part just didn't work. Returned & disappointed",0
"I wanted to like this product but am halfway through and every time I apply this.. my skin flakes and peels off. In a sense, I like that it peeling off dead skin ?? but in another way, it doesn't make sense since i wash hydrate exfoliate consistently. I don't think it's a perfect match and wish there was more information about why skin peels w/ certain products and not others...",1
I wanted to like this so bad but it doesn't show up on my fair skin except for the bridge of my nose which I'm not sure is the only feature I wanna highlight -__- If your skin is 100% matte and has zero shine then I imagine you'd benefit from this. my skin isn't oily but I still have some shine so this product didn't work for me.,1
"I wanted to love it because I’m a huge fan of It Cosmetics. Unfortunately for me it was not a good moisturizer. I applied it to a fresh clean face and the went put on the rest of my products. It made my face extremely oily and my makeup wire off throughout the day. I tried it again the next day sans makeup and my face was still extremely oily. If someone is suffering with dry skin this would probably work wonders. But for someone who already has oily skin, prepare to have a shiny face and continuously blotting your face to take the oils off.",1
"I wanted to love love this foundation. But unfortunately I did not care for it. After weeks of trying it out, I was dying to stop using it. The color match was great and it was very lightweight. But it did not stay on my face. I tried different primers and different powders, but no matter what I tried, withing a couple hours I looked oily (and I have dry skin) and the foundation was hardly there. I normally love Dior""s foundation, but this one just wasn't a hit for me. I received this product free for testing purposes.",2
"I wanted to love this because I love Perricone products, and I have been wanting a skin-loving light foundation. I opened the box to find the dropper shattered. Not a big deal, it is glass. My second thought was that nude is crazy dark! A swatch of it though, and I realize it adjusts somewhat to your skin color it seems, which is great! I tried applying this with a beauty blender, but it just soaked the product up. I then tried it with my fingers, and this method works the best. My skin felt heavy and sticky though with almost no coverage. Then I applied my blush and some concealer, and the foundation came off as I tried to blend. So weird! In the end, as the day wore on, I felt greasy (I have combo skin with some dry patches from winter). My daughter said it looked ok, but I just felt yucky. I was happy to wash it off. I tried it a few more times with different primers, but nothing worked well. This is not a great foundation for me, unfortunately. I did get this product to review, and this is my honest opinion of the product. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",4
"I wanted to love this because I only use brush tip eyeliners, and this is awful. About a week into using it (and I use my eyeliners very gently and they last for ages), the bristles started to splay and bend and separate and omg... just terrible. I know it's cheaper than other eyeliners, but don't waste your money. Not happy.",4
I wanted to love this because of the hype but it clogged my pores and caused breakouts.  I have dry skin so I cannot imagine what this will do for oily skins. it did make me glow but that's because there was oil on my face.  it works as well as a cheaper face oil.,3
"I wanted to love this, but I only got to use it three times before I found that the crimped end of the tube split. I found out when I pulled the tube from my purse and tried to apply some to my lips. That's when the balm squeezed out the end, due to the opening, and got all over my hand.",2
"I wanted to love this but, you have to go in like 10 times to get enough product to come out for your lips to be covered. It's really hard so it doesn't come out easy at all. I do love the texture when I finally get it on but its sooo much work. And like other reviews said it is so tiny for the price.",2
"I wanted to love this. I loved the way it made my skin feel, but I couldn't get past the smell. It has a very strong smell that I could smell for awhile. I'm not normally sensitive to smell but this one is over powering. I started using it on my neck and I did see a softness to the lines there. If it wasn't for the smell and if I could have used it on my face i probably would've given it more stars.",2
"I wanted to love this, I really did, but ultimately it left me confused lol. The part that really puts me off from this is the staggering amount of product that comes off on the brush. It's like you're applying two applications worth of a thick, mousey liquid lip at one time. The product doesn't dry down very fast, so you're left with a dangerous amount of thick, transferable, smudgeable product on your lips, until you're eventually brave enough to eat or drink something. The stain it leaves behind, in my opinion, is not worth the hassle of the initial stages of this product. There needs to be a better stopper on this, so less product comes through on the brush, because the only way I've found to apply this without ruining the rest of my makeup, is to wipe the product on my hand and get rid of a LARGE amount of product before applying it. Like a LARGE amount. So much so that it makes me uncomfortable to do it, because I feel like I'm wasting so much product.",0
I wanted to love this mascara so much because Kat’s products are usually so good. I don’t mind a drier formula but this one is just too dry. It was great for the first week I had it- and it fans lashes out beautifully and they hold. But I have dry flakes and bits all over my face every time I look in the mirror- even an hour after I put it on. This was highly anticipated for me and I’m real bummed about it. Will def not purchase again.,2
"I wanted to love this palette because its clean and I need warm colors, unfortunately the colors are much darker in person and have a cool tone to them. Not a true warm palette. The eyeshadow seems lovely but I cant wear these colors well having yellow undertone.",1
"I wanted to love this palette,  I loved the color story and the reviews were great. for me the two shimmers were useless they didnt show up even when applying a sticky base. for me it was hard to create a look that didnt muddy together. maybe I just am not creative enough to use this right. also I felt that the shades didnt last on my eyes, even with primer.",0
"I wanted to love this powder, but it made my skin look weirdly dry in some areas and lifted my makeup in others. Not to mention that the lightest shade was two dark for me. There's really only three shades? Had to return.",0
"I wanted to love this product but I couldn't. My face broke out the next day. My skin became really textured, red, and I started to see pores on my face. I would definitely recommend getting a sample before purchasing the full size product.",4
"I wanted to love this product. I love every other Drunk Elephant product I’ve ever used. I am a self tanner, but tanning products break me out. I figured this would be perfect to help match my face to my body. I put it on my face, and while dragging it down to my neck, it started to remove my self tan, so my became all gross and patchy. Plus, I could not get it looking even on my face. I very very rarely return items to Sephora, but I did return it.",0
I wanted to love this product. Unfortunately it doesn't work for me. I get horrible breakouts every single time. I am not sure why. The formula is not heavy or greasy it seem easy to absorb. I have combination skin but if I put it on my face at night as soon as the next morning I get big pimples all over my face.,4
"I wanted to love this set but unfortunately, neither product worked for me.  The moisturizer isn't hydrating enough, it burns for a min upon application, I noticed increased redness in some areas and it balled up and sloughed off terribly when I tried to add two drops of Marula Oil on top, an issue I've never had with any other moisturizer. I had to remove it and reapply, skipping the oil the next time.\n\nI found the lip treatment to be very oily and not hydrating. It also has an intense peppermint scent, an ingredient that isn't listed here or on the full size tube, and had I known about it, I would have skipped this set. I just don't like peppermint in any lip product. \n\nThe moisturizer is a real let down for me because the brand claims it's ideal for sensitive, reactive and eczema prone skin like mine, however, after taking a closer look at the ingredients, I was annoyed to see eucalyptus oil, a known irritant. Essential oils, especially fragrant ones like eucalyptus, don't belong in products marketed to those with sensitive skin and this explains the burning, and possibly the redness, I experienced.  I think those with normal or oily skin without sensitivity will like this but it's not for me.",2
"I wanted to love this so badly but I just can't. Personally, I couldn't stand the feeling of applying makeup like this with my Clarisonic. It tickled so badly around my nose and it just felt awkward overall. I'd be able to look past this if I loved the finish of my foundation, but I didn't. While I think this concept is great, I don't feel the brush texture or bristles give a natural enough finish.",0
"I wanted to love this so badly! I have a hard time getting it to work for me though. It's very finely milled, which I love, but it is easy to over apply the powder and end up looking cakey. I also have to be careful what foundation I apply it over. I have a Shiseido one that it looks terrible with, but it looks very nice over my Guerlain. I just don't find myself reaching for it regularly.",4
"I wanted to love this so much! It's a clean natural deodorant, smells great and at a good price point all things considered. However, afte the first use my pits were so irritated and red. I used up the entire stick hoping it would go away but it never did. As soon as I went back to my tried and true natural deodorant the redness and irritation went away. This might be good for someone trying natural deodorants for the first time, but as someone who's been on natural ones for over a year, this one missed the mark. I would love to try again if there is a reformulation because the scent and cooling feeling is great, just the irritation was no fun.",0
I wanted to love this so much. So many great colors to choose from. It also looked nice on my skin. But it caused me to get horrible acne. Big pimples that I never had before using the product. After not using the UD foundation and going back to fenty my skin was clear again.,2
I wanted to love this; the Jaclyn Hill palette is a part of my daily routine but this one... It gives a nice a blend at the end of a look but the blush is practically transparent upon application. The contour color is way too warm for my complexion. I'm just not stoked on this product.,4
"I wanted to try the Jeju Green Tea Seed Serum but i wasn't sure if the consistency will work for me or not, this trio not only made me fall in love with the serum but also allow me to try 2 more products form this brand and I FELL IN LOVE WITH ALL THREE. Love the products and this was the perfect way to try them and make sure they work for me before committing to the full size product.",1
I wanted to try the most hyped products hence went for it. I must say that I am not that satisfied given the price. The only good find from this is the vitamin c serum. I am going to buy the full size.,4
I wanted to try this and see what was the hype. it is super thick. I thought it was okay for a while ... I started to notice terrible breakouts but I wasn't sure what itw as I discontinued using this and no more break outs. i do not have sensitive skin either. would not recommend especially for oily. may work well for dry?,1
I wanted to try this brand and was hoping I would love it and it would be amazing unfortunately it was not even the cheap price it was didn't do anything for me I put it on and it just flaked off Dissapointing,3
"I wanted to try this product so I bought the cheapest bottle. I have been experimenting with the double-wash on days that I wear makeup hoping to get my skin to a place where I can wear less makeup all together. This is a nice exfoliating wash and is pretty gentle. I am not sure it is worth the higher price of the larger bottles since it's all going down the drain anyway and I am not relying on it as my primary face wash. The prices of some of these products is getting pretty outrageous but if your okay with paying more, than it's worth it.",2
"I want them all! I never knew the hype over expensive eyeliners, kind of like mascara. But these are so creamy and vibrant. A little on the soft side so if you want a dry formula, this is not for you. I got the  mini duo first and loved it. So i bought Out of the blue for summer eyelooks. BOY is it blue! I love it.",1
"I want to like this product, but its main ingredient is alcohol which is very detrimental to the skin, and given my skin is drier these days it doesn't really do it any favors. It does leave a glow to the skin but my face doesn't feel very nourished, which is what you would expect from a product like this. I also hate the smell. It smells like Listerine.. I think I might donate it to someone who feels like it works for them but for me, it isn't a favorite.",1
I want to say I see a difference in my lips from this. I mean my lips are dry and then my environment is arid AF. but I think this is working for me. I guess I need to use the whole bottle before I judge but so far so good I like it.,0
"I want to say that I absolutely loved this color and formula. It had decent lasting power and the color was so flattering for my skin tone. Unfortunately, the lipstick isn't secure in the component. When you take it out of the package you can actually feel the lipstick moving as you move the component. The lipstick was not broken even though it was easily moved. It did immediately break the first time I applied it. I thought maybe I could live with it if I was careful but the lipstick kept getting stuck in the lid after that. I have seen a lot of people have this same issue on different social media sites but I had hoped they had resolved the issue. Unfortunately I couldn't get my money back even though I had the credit card I used to purchase it.",1
"I want to thank INFLUENSTER for allowing me to be a part of PERRICONE MD NO MAKEUP FOUNDATION.  This was such a great sized bottle to try and I love the pump action.  It was incredibly smooth and creamy with equal coverage all around.  My only problem was color matching, while the porcelain was the right shade, it's undertone did not meet up.  Porcelain seemed to yield more yellow undertones rather than pink.   [product:perricone-md-no-makeup-foundation-broad-spectrum-spf25] I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",3
"I was a bit skeptical of this product at first but after using it for two weeks I've noticed some really positive results. I've tried several high-end eye creams and noticed positive results with some, but none have brightened the skin around my eyes as much as this one. The formula feels soft and gentle. It absorbs nicely but isn't super hydrating. It doesn't feel as soothing as others but again nothing has brightened the skin around my eyes, particularly the inner corners like this eye cream. I didn't expect this since this isn't what this product is advertised to do but the ingredients just seem to agree with my skin. This product is pricey and I may not use it as often (twice a day currently) to make it last but I do plan to keep it in my skincare routine. Also I've learned that I don't need a full pump as advertised . Half a pump is usually enough to spread around my eyes at a time.",4
I was able to smell the product in store and was taken right away. The balm applies clear and smoothly and hydrates for a long time. I keep reaching for it everyday. The scent is warm amd sweet. I have very sensitive skin and I react easily with anything. This didn't give me any problem.,1
"I was actually a little disappointed. The formula didn't last that long and the shimmer spread all underneath my eyes within a few hours. I don't really need jumbo eyeshadows, and these contain talc, a less than good for you ingredient. There's nothing special about this product!",4
"I  was a familiar with some of the products but thought it was such a good deal for $29 you get  the brow wow plus 3 other products.  They are decent sized. I wanted to try hoola and this was a perfect way to do that, i already love the big bang mascara and the primer.",2
"I was a fan of the old formula. I had horrible adult acne and the old formula worked like a miracle in clearing it up without irritating, stripping or leaving a weird film my skin. bonus that it smelled like a spa! I was hesitant to purchase the new formula and glad I didn't! requested a sample and used it for 3 days. after washing my face it left an oily film. after using toner I noticed there was A LOT of dirt and make up on the cotton ball. \n\nthis is a definite mistake in reformulation. please bring back the old formula!",4
"I was a little hesitant to try this concealer due to many of the reviews saying it was a light coverage concealer, however I am so glad that I picked it up while it was on sale. The coverage in my opinion is medium which is what I prefer for an everyday look. The formula is amazing and glides right onto the skin without tugging it.  The doe foot applicator is amazing!! oh my gosh I don't have to re-dip into the bottle, the applicator is more flat which holds more product. I am able to apply the concealer under both my eyes, on my eyelids, on the bridge of my nose and my forehead while still having product left over. It also blends out like a dream. The best part is that there is no scent! I find it so hard to find products these days  that are scent free. I typically wear concealer in a light medium shade and went with light which was perfect. I definitely recommend this concealer and I'm so sad that I didn't try it sooner.",4
"I was a little skeptical about this, but its turned into one of my favorite products. I have combination skin so I definitely make sure to wash it off in the morning (on a lazy day off I did forget til mid afternoon and my skin was more oily than usual - ik assuming from not washing the mask off in the morning)\nIt feels quit thick but it feels so good and leaves much skin feeling so fresh",1
I was a little skeptical about this product but I actually love it. it's super lightweight and quick to apply but stays put all day. I was looking for a lighter coverage foundation for the summer when it's so hot and this is perfect. it will get a little darker after it oxidizes as well.,4
I was a little skeptical to use an essence made of kombucha considered that kombucha is fermented tea but if it's good for my digestion it must be good for my face too haha! this essence goes on very smoothly and has definitely changed the texture of my skin to be more even and provides a beautiful glow that really looks like beauty from within. this product does what it says it does and would recommend to anyone looking for a gentle daily toner,0
I was a little skeptical when I first tired it because of the sheer formula. It’s sheer on the first layer but buildable enough that it gets to be pretty bright after the 3rd layer  It’s a tad sticky but not enough to get stuck in your hair. I even tried it lightly on my cheeks and it’s gave me a good light flush!,0
"I was a little surprised when I opened the tube. I feel that the color is a tad bit brighter than how it looks online. Still looks great on medium to dark skin tones. I can't say for deep or ebony tones. Also it almost smells like chocolate to me. A little goes a VERY LONG way. The first time trying I put 3 tiny dots on my cheek and that was way too much after blending out. It's a little pricey to me but considering how little u need for each use, this tube could easily last a year. If I decide to purchase again I would try stutter.",1
I was already familiar with the serum and was eager to try the moisturizer in the set. The serum is like a drink of water for your skin and the moisturizer relieves the skin by sealing all that moisture in. I find the light scent is so soothing. This is my daytime combo for the winter. \n\nThis set was a great way for me to discover the cream at a really good deal. I may stock up a few extras to get me through the winter!,2
I was amazed when I saw the results in the morning. My skin was plumper and more radiant. My skin is smoother with repeated use. It does sting a bit when applied but that doesn't last. If you follow the directions it is dry/set by the time you go to bed.,3
"I was an avid MAC Studio fix user but have used this one for several years. Matches my skin tone 100%. I just love how smooth it feels, never cakey or heavy. And it blends so well with the Sephora concealers.",3
I was at my wits end with spontaneous hormonal acne i was trying different moisturizers and nothing was helping my akin look better. At a last ditch effort i got a sample of Tatcha water cream ive been using it for a month and the difference has been from night to day. My skin looks healthy and radiant will be purchasing again!,2
"I was attracted first to the color. When I received the lipstick, the color was perfect for my complexion! I put the lipstick on before bedtime, and when I awakened 10 hrs later, the lipstick was still on with no color changes! My lips looked the same as when I went to bed, and my husband also noticed the color of my lips! This is great lipstick and I love the color Rosewood!",3
"I was completely disappointed. the liquid liner is to goopy and just really thick. the brush doesn't allow for it to go on easy. the liner stick is ok, but not worth the wait, and money. I love Huda beauty products but not this time around.",4
"I was concerned about spending the money on this considering how small the jar is, but it goes such a long, long way. I've noticed a great deal of hydration on my under eyes and I barely notice my fine lines peaking through my make up with this underneath. would definitely recommend!",1
"I was curious to try this during the 50% off sale, mainly because I thought the color would be more of an orange-russet and I love the scent of ginger (and by extension, gingerbread). However, in my attached photo (please ignore the glare off my glasses) you can see that it's more of a regular ""brown"" color on my lips, and dries down significantly darker than it appears in the bottle (and the sample photos provided). But the most disappointing factor is the fragrance: it's not ginger, or gingerbread - it's pure buttercream frosting. The scent was so overly sweet it actually made me nauseous. So I'm sorry to say that this is going right back.",1
"I was disappointed as soon as I opened the palette, firstly, the shades on the description/picture weren't the same. they may be but the picture did not capture them good. next, there was product everywhere, they didn't break but it being so chalky just left product all over the place. the product while being clean of everything, very big plus , was not that impressive on the eye. i wanted to really love this brand, and for the price of the little one palette, it was ok to try but not buying the bigger one, i will probably give this one away.",2
I was disappointed. I bought the pencil because I have confidence in the brand and this was exactly the color I wanted. The color is perfect and it went on nicely. Unfortunately it had no staying power. It started transferring to my upper lid immediately. Within an hour or two it was pretty much gone.,4
I was disappointed in this mascara. I was so excited to try it because of all the hype.  It took 4+ coats to look as good as 2 coats of Chanel Volume or Lancome Hypnose Drama mascara.  I have nice long eyelashes that are average in thickness and it took to many layers to get decent coverage and for me the brush is to big to get all the lashes.  I did get this as a deluxe sample. Maybe the full size product is better.,3
I was dying to try this and bought the 4 pack I've heard about it for so long and the idea for the mask is good it stays on your face and ties behind your ears but that's about it. There was no result at all other than some very small amount of oil left on my face which made me look greasy and would not absorb into the skin.,2
"I was excited for this foundation to be released. I love buying and supporting cruelty free products, especially if they are vegan. I have used the KVD Lock It foundation before and overall its a good foundation, just a little heavy for my taste. So I was hoping this new foundation would be as good as the original but with a lighter feel. Sadly this foundation is horrible and nothing like the original. When I went to test a color on the back of my hand nothing but muddy looking water came out. Huge red flag right there. The sales woman tried to convince me its just a water based foundation that needs to be shaken well. She shook it up and then made me a sample. So the next day I used it. It felt just like rubbing oil all around my face, just with a bit of pigment in it. I tried and tried to buff it in (on top of my primer) using my It Cosmetics airbrush foundation brush. The sloppy oily paste just smeared around my face but would not dry. I tried putting a good powder on top of it, in hopes of getting it to dry up. But I felt like a greasy mess all day and could not wait to get home and wash my face. I use foundations half the price that work 10 times better than this. I would never purchase this product.",1
I was excited for this. packaging is cute but it didn't match what's inside. the blush looks beautiful on the eyes. I'm disappointed in the Brown color. the first is gritty and I can feel it on my eyes when I'm trying to apply it. geeks kind of like rubbing sand on my eyelids. shame :(,1
"I was excited to finally try something from natasha danona and did plenty of research first. having heard that most of the mini palettes dont have to same quality as its larger counterparts I was wary but I've also heard so many say the mini nude was the exception and the quality was supposedly fantastic, so I thought about it and ended up buying it. now I can say I completely disagree. this is one of the worst eye shadow palettes I've ever tried omgosh. now, having said that every shade isnt bad... but for the price and also for the reputation this brand has I wld expect much more. the 2 shimmers are pretty but nothing special, you can easily find prettier shimmers in most other eyeshadow brands. the duochrome isnt actually a duochrome at all.. it's more of a dull taupe sortof shimmer with tiny flecks of green glitter which by the way have horrible fallout and overall isnt really that stunning of a shade to begin with. now, the peachy orange matte shade blends beautifully and has wonderful pigment and also stays on all day.. but then the dark brown matte shade ugh! it's a great color, but it is soooo hard to work with. it feels dry but when u apply it it acts like its sticky.. literally will not blend AT ALL! I tried using other shadows under it thinking the powder texture wld help it glide over and blend better but nope.. that didnt help and I've never come across a shadow that did that. about the only thing I can use that for is a smoking it near the lash line with a smudger brush because it's just so ridiculously patchy. then, besides the obvious issues with the shadows themselves I also dont understand the color story here.. its mostly a warm palette but then u have the duochrome which has a cool taupe base, and what irks me is the lightest shade is very cool toned and I hate mixing cool and warm since it just looks off. i feel like this shld be more user friendly. this is an epic fail.",2
"I was excited to find a primer that didn't have any acne-causing ingredients, and indeed, it didn't cause acne. Hurray! It also had a very nice smooth finish when I smoothed this over my sunscreen. It really only takes 2 drops. Unfortunately, I didn't see any noticeable results from using it. My foundation still oxidized. My face still got oily. My makeup still wore off a bit after a day of blotting. And so back it went.",3
"I was excited to get a free sample of this cream since i love First Aid beauty products. I tried it for a week, then stopped because my skin was burning so much. Tried it again a week later, same burn. I was surprised since i don't have sensitive skin at all. I guess its just not for me.",2
"I was excited to give this mascara a try - I use only waterproof as I have an oily t-zone, and anything else just ends up under my eyes a couple hours into the day. I put on my makeup around 7:30 am - I use an eyelash curler before applying mascara and was really surprised when I applied this stuff I was left with super straight lashes. Usually waterproof tend to hold the curl pretty well, but I could littlest see them straightening out. So I grabbed my heated eyelash curler and that seemed to help. This mascara did tend to migrate a bit through the day unfortunately, and by the time I was taking my makeup off around 8:30 I had had to clean up under my eyes a few times that day. Not the best mascara I've tried for sure...",3
"I was excited to recieve my palette as I am a fan of too faced products. the shades are beautiful to look at but when trying them on, comes the disappointment. the whole top shimmery row has no pigment and is very chalky and hard to blend. there are only three mattes which also are not easily blendable the one I like is I can't even but the rest :(. the glittery ones are beautiful but with fall out.",2
"I was excited to try a new mascara, I am a mascara junkie. I do not have a lot of lashes, they are not long, and they do not curl. This mascara is nice for a very natural look, I did not find it clumpy at all, but for my lashes it did not do much. I think the price is fairly inline with the brand, and I think that if you have nice lashes and want something natural this would be great, but I like a little more drama with my almost nonexistent lashes.",1
"I was excited to try his product as I have recently turned 45(!) and have been unsuccessfully trying to deal with my ""mature eye"".  Also, I really love all the Murad products I've used in he past.  But.....this was a dud.  If anything, my eyes actually looked *puffier* than before I put it on!  So disappointed!  On to the next sample......",3
"I was excited to try my first ABH palette, and thought the colors of Norvina were gorgeous so I picked it over going with the soft glam ABH. I've only had urban decay naked palettes so far, so thought it was time to expand. The brush that comes with this is mediocore compared to UD, and the fallout is incredible, I barely dip my brush in for fear of fallout. The colors are very pigmented, which is a plus, but be very cautious with the fallout . It also feels very cakey and thick, even though I don't apply much of it. I also usually  need hypoallegenic product, and this palette seems to bother my eyes and contacts. Beautiful and versatile colors however, can definely create fun looks with this one. I dont think I will purchase any more ABH palettes as I can't stand the overwhelming powder mess.",0
I was excited to try the Clarisonic. I used it once and felt absolutely nothing. The other brush bristles do not spin. Not sure what they are even there for.  The small inner bristles vibrate but I could hardly feel it moving. I've used a Mary Kay brush in the past which the whole thing spins. It's much better. Definitely returning this. Waste of money.,2
"I was excited to try the Hakuho-do handmade brushes. I wonder why they've sat in the sale section for a few yrs. I figured out why after purchasing 3 out of the 5. The pkg presentation is wonderful. It has a beautiful red laquared wooden handle with gold font printing of the brush name, as well as a matte black ferrule. The bristle design/style were good too. I ended up keeping ONLY 1 of the 3. It wasnt the large teardrop brush. The bristels are synthetic. Their soft but not overly. For the price I expected a HIGHER quality! The boy reason I kept one. Was its design suited a need in which I hadn't seen in  other brands brush styles. Had these been natural hair or a higher quality synthetic. I'd kept all 3.",3
"I was excited to try the Hakuho-do x Sephora brushes. I know Hakuho-do brushes are handmade. I figured these would be the same quality, but no. Previous to purchasing, I had wondered why they've sat in the sale section for a few yrs. I figured out why after purchasing 3 out of the 5 brushes in the collection. Each brush is pkg in a luxe red box. So presentation is an A+. Each brush has a beautiful red laquared wood handle with the collab name in gold font print, as well as a matte black ferrule. I even was interested in bristle design/style were. I ended up keeping ONLY the Sloping Powder Brush. It's perfect for setting my under eyes. I've not seen this design by other brush makers. The lack of quality is with the synthetic bristels. Their kinda soft but not overly like high end. For the price I expected a HIGHER quality! Had these been natural hair or a higher quality synthetic. I'd kept all 3. The sloping powder brush gets a 3☆ but the others only a 2☆. FYI: None of my brushes shed.",3
I was excited to try these as I have moderate crowd feet and laugh lines. Decided to use them for my crows feet. They were much smaller than I expected. Darts don't hurt at all going in. Took off the patches and was slightly red so I waited to pass judgement to it went away. To my dismay they did absolutely nothing for my lines. Wouldn't buy them again because it was s waste of money.,4
I was excited to try this as I have heard good things about Glow Recipe...but I am not impressed. It is a weird texture and really should be in a pump bottle rather than a jar. I find it rather gloppy and hard to get out.  It smells pretty gross imo and sadly the scent sticks around.  Strike three is that it is very sticky on the skin even hours later and doesn't really ever soak in.  Too light for a night cream and not friendly u der my makeup...a pass.  Glad it was free (I was sent this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for a review).,1
I was excited to try this foundation so I got it as a free sample on a order I purchased and man oh man was I in shock. As soon as I started putting it on you can see the foundation and even with a small amount you could see  patches even with primer. My pores were more visible. It really did not do justice for me and I'm so sad. Had high hopes but not for me. It also felt itchy as I was spreading it almost like giving me a rash.,3
"I was excited to try this mascara, but unfortunately it left my lashes clumpy. It was very black and thick, I just think it's not a good formula for my short and straight lashes.\nI received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes.",2
I was excited to try this palette and the shimmer/metallic shades applied nicely on my eyelids. However I experienced a lot of fallout and the glitter really irritated my eyes so I had to return this product.,0
I was excited to try this product because of all the hype. I used it once and it left my skin with a tight dry feeling afterwards. Meaning my skin's ph balance was seriously compromised. I won't use this product again.,4
"I was excited to try this product from all the great reviews. I would say my skin isn’t too sensitive I wear medium coverage everyday, wash my face every night etc.\n\nThis serum I’m not sure what ingredient it was but I started to get bumps, red bumps and breaking out I used it for 3 days and it got worse and worse I realized it was the serum I returned it",0
"I was excited to try this product given all of the rave reviews. This did not work for me at all. First, the product smelled terrible. Second, after consistently using it for a few weeks, I saw no change in my skin whatsoever.  In fact, my skin was more dry than usual and just dull. Maybe it just didn’t work with my regimen but to me, it was a waste.",0
"I was excited to try this shade as it looked and read exactly like my skin tone. I tried it with no primer, water based, oil based, silicone, no silicone, powder/no powder,  setting spray... I seriously tried everything I could think of!! Nothing I did made this foundation look good on my skin. it was almost gritty looking. It settled into my pores and was extremely splotchy (even on areas where my skin looks very smooth, with or without my usual foundation).",4
I was expecting a bit more from these. They are very glittery. I prefer more of a shimmer but they were very very sheer. Subtle to the point where I questioned if maybeee I received a bad batch. These could be perfect for someone else but I will be returning these or they would be in the back of my vanity with all the other products I dont use.,4
"I was expecting to love this.  Unfortunately, I think La Mer should stick to lotion/cream as every other product I try from them is disappointing.  Ridiculously overpriced, this oil was no different.  I guess for the price I was expecting something really great.  As another reviewer mentioned, if it gets in your eyes everything will be blurry for quite a while, which was very annoying.  Nothing special about the smell either.  You could spend 1/10 of the money and get a cleansing oil that would work perfectly fine.  I am giving three stars because I liked the packaging; it matches my bathroom ;)",2
"I was expecting way too much from a product in the expensive side of the spectrum. This product is only okay; it gives you a natural look. It does not help lengthen your lashes or anything. Considering the price, it is really not worth it. I have tried 20 different mascaras and this one is among my least favorite. Plus, what I received did not look like on the website; it also looks mishandled.",4
"I was extremely excited to get this palette as a birthday present this year since it is a product I cannot normally afford. Sadly, when I opened the palette for the first time I noticed that two of the eyeshadows appeared loose in their pans. Sure enough these two eyeshadows FELL OUT of the palette. First, I'm upset that this is a $130 product that arrived to me faulty. Second, this is the second time this has happened to me with a ND palette. This first time, I had two shadows fall out of a 5 pan palette from a previous holiday collection. I'm wondering why palettes as expensive as these ones are not going through proper quality controls. Will be returning to hopefully receive a correct palette.",0
"I was extremely skeptical of this. I previously tried the Coco Cabana cream and I hated it. The smell was extremely strong, gave me an instant headache and made me nauseous. I ended up giving it to my daughter. \nBut then, I received this as a gift from a well meaning person. I didn't want it, but being appreciative, I had to at least try. \nThe smell is still strong but not as sickly sweet as the other and didn't make me feel ill. Then, after showering, I slathered this all over and OMG! It's so amazing. My skin has never been so soft and smooth. I'm a believer now",1
"I was gifted this by Proactive for a review. Thank you so much!  Once a month I sometimes break out with some hormonal acne, and it has left a few red areas around my chin. I used this Pore Target treatment and the next morning,  the areas were less red and my skin looked brighter! I will keep using!",2
"I was given this product complimentary in exchange for a review. \n\nPros: Thin formula that is moisturizing and absorbed easily. This is not a heavy moisturizer and I have been using it in my morning routine after a serum and essence and it has done quite well. Seems to be moisturizing throughout the day and as not broken me out or made me extra greasy in my T-zone. It's more of a lotion consistency than cream.\n\nCons: I am not a fan of banana scent, and this has the classic candy banana scent. Thankfully it goes away quickly. I don't know why it did not come with a spatula because you do need one in order to get the product out without contaminating the whole jar.  I am not a fan of the bottle shape and suspect it could be annoying to get the product out as I get to the end.  I live in the NE and in the dry winter, this may not be enough long term. I'd say it's better for day use, summer use, or those with an oily complexion. \n\nThe product certainly provides moisture but I didn't see any immediate impacts beyond that.",2
"I was given this product for reviews. I like the packaging of this product. The liquid is light and absorbs quickly on my skin. The product helps my skin feel hydrated and plumped. It has a light scent. Not overpowering at all. As far as other effects, I haven't noticed it yet. I would reccomend this product to those that are looking for a good hydratimg serum . I have dry to normal skin and barely get breakouts.",4
"I was going back and forth forever about whether or not I wanted to buy this set. I finally did and it smells amazing (a little bit like pickles when you first open it?? then like cookies after a while) and its adorable and comes with a lot of stuff and it's really inexpensive. but the packaging feels cheap and the colors aren't all *that* pigmented. except the lip gloss. that stuff stains. I almost don't want to use it, even though it looks amazing and smells amazing, just because it stains my skin so much. I was so excited, and I'm not exactly let down, just wasn't worth the hype I was expecting.",1
I was going to a party and decided to use some of this on my legs and arms...Forgot all about it until someone sd wow ur tan is to die for and one person sd OMG since u arrived u have gotten darker... def shows to some degree within an hour. the smell is great.,3
"I was going to splurge and buy the full size kush mascara after using up the one that came with the birthday gift, and saw this instead - so glad I went for it. the full sized mascara is so heavy you could conk someone on the head with it if you really needed to, and I love the brush. buildable without feeling clumpy and gross. I haven't used a brow gel before but I LOVE this so far! the lip balm is a little smaller than I thought it would be but honestly it's a fine size to try something like that out. Ive only worn it once and like it but I'm not smitten; will have to give it a few more tries but it's very subtly sweet and not super waxy feeling.",1
I was going to take this back when I tested it on day one. I used the tatch canvas silk primer. it was patchy and moved all around. on the 2nd day I used a primer that I got as a sample ( forgot the name) and the foundation went on beautifully and stayed. the formula is a 10. the shade with the subtle red is a ten. love it!,3
"I was having high hopes for this mascara.  It really disappointed me!!  It didn't hold a curl, made my lashes clump together.   It smeared even after 5 minutes of being on my lashes.  I have tried numerous mascaras and I would rank this one was one of the worse.  I will be giving it away to someone that can use it (hopefully.)",3
"I was hesitant at first to pay that much for a deodorant, but I am so glad I bought it. I have been on a neverending quest to find a clean deodorant with great ingredients that would also smell good. This is the one! This is a very high quality product, it works well, feels luxuous and smells like heaven. Tarte Cosmetics has lovely products. If you are on the fence about this one I suggest you give it a try.",4
"I was hesitant to pick up this set for practicality, but it just looked so pretty I couldn't resist. The body oil is not something I'd normally use, but I am an every day gloss girl. I am so so glad I ignored my brain and picked this up! The gloss is non-sticky, feels nice and looks so pretty. It's super minty scented and gives a slight tingle. That body oil though...! It's sorcery! It has a very very refined glitter to it, and it disperses around evenly. It dries down so it won't budge from your clothes, and stays on throughout the day. I find myself putting a dab on just for the scent alone, it smells sooo good. I'm hoping there will be a perfume release at some point, lol. Anyway, as I mentioned it's not something I would normally use; but this converted me it's so fantastic. This was a gem of a set, and I would happily buy them both separately. Easily my favorite holiday release! I read reviews that people had faulty nozzles, but I have had zero issues with mine. I did however try to see if I could twist it open just in case something happened and I don't recommend doing that, it's very sharp.",1
"I was hesitant to purchase this at first because of the price point and the fact that I have plenty of other palettes with pinks/purples/golds. After swatching this at Sephora though I knew I needed to get this. It is absolutely AMAZING. With or without primer the colours apply beautifully. The glitters and golds in this palette are a formula that I have never seen before in the industry. Huda has gone above and beyond and I completely understand why this palette is more expensive than the average palette. I can CONFIRM that it is WORTH every penny (or nickel because im Canadian!). \n\nIf you're thinking about getting this, stop thinking and just buy it!!!",2
"I was hesitant to try it at first because I've had bad experiences with other matte foundations in the past, but this one quickly became my all time favourite foundation. you can easily buil up to a full coverage without it being cakey, and it lasts all day. will be repurchasing",4
"I was hesitant to try this because I haven't had the best luck with this line. On my skin tone (NARS Tahoe) this creates a beautiful, just got out of the pool sheen on my skin. I use a small dome shaped powder brush to buff it into my cheekbones and brow bone. The effect is beautiful.",2
I was highly impressed with this mascara! It separated my lashes and gave them length. It was so easy to remove later on. this will be my number one mascara from now on. If you want nice lashes that look full and nice - get this!,4
"I was hoping after reading reviews that I would be someone that found great relief in this product but unfortunately I fall in with the bad reviews. My lips felt so much worse about 1 hour after using this, more dry, cracked and peeling.",2
"I was hoping this was as good as the reviews said it was:( Nope, huge disappointment! Smells nice, if you like the smell of mint, but didn't help with stress or pain at all. I think essential oils would be better and for less money too!",3
"I was hoping to love this product but I was disappointed. After reading the reviews I thought it would be amazing but I was only left wth a very subtle difference. Yes, it did make my skin slightly brighter and soft but that was it. My honest opinion, there are other products that can do the same for way less. Definitely not worth the price.",4
"I was impressed by how this treated my skin. My skin was brighter and clearer. It felt much softer after using. I put it on before I use my moisturizer. I didn't mind the scent at all. My only complaint is that it seemed to dry out some of my face, specifically around my jaw. (I recieved this product free for reviewing purposes)",4
"I was in need of a serum that help restore moisture to my skin - enter my fav Drunk Elephant product! I have a few spots on my face that can get really dry, really quick and this is one of the only products I've found that truly helps. I love it!",2
"I was in tears trying to get this lip balm to open. It slides open and you really need fingernails or strong nails to open it.  I have been keeping it just a tiny bit open so I can slide it open easily (see photo), but it often closes when I pick it up.  I will never buy this again.  The product?  I’d probably like it better if it weren’t so hard to open.",3
"I was in the market for a foundation with SPF, and this was suggested by a clerk. She applied this to half of my face, and my jaw DROPPED! No more redness, no imperfections whatsoever. My naturally pink cheeks were gone. \nI've tried MANY other foundations, but I have no need to try another. I'm absolutely sold on this.",3
"I was intrigued with this type of foundation so decided to give it a try.  I have combination skin so was at first apprehensive about using an oil base foundation.  However after a week everything seems good.  I'm not a heavy foundation person, but I use light formulas to get a nice, fresh wash of color.  This provides a really natural, skin-like finish. It stays all day without any discoloration.  I've discovered the following are a must to achieving that optimal perfect application finish:\n\n1. Do not use a dewy moisturizer underneath as that will cause pilling.  I use a light moisturizer which has a matte-like feel.\n2. Allow 2-3 minutes for the oils to absorb and the pigments to settle on skin before applying blush or finishing powder.\n3. Wash hands or thoroughly wipe them after application because the pigments can stain clothing or anything you touch.  Works best with finger application because it's really thin formula.",3
"I was introduced to this product recently when I was gifted a three-piece set by Influenster. This serum is amazing! I have combination skin, and it helps me stay hydrated, without breaking me out. Definitely a great product if you want your skin to glow.",1
"I was kind of skeptical so I got my hands on a sample first. \n\nthis stuff is amazing. like really. it smells good. it feels good. it moisturizes. it actually does sightly improve the appearance of cellulite. \n\nhowever.\n\ndo not use this at night if you want to sleep especially if you have a... larger surface area to cover. you will absorb the caffeine and guarana through your skin and you will feel the effects. the first time I used it was after a bedtime shower. that's usually when i moisturize. I could not sleep. too me a bit to figure out why, but once I did I decided I love it so much, I'll just change the time I moisturize. I love it more than coffee because, due to the dermal absorption, it's more like a time release. it's great for work because I work in a lab and I cant have beverages in there so I now keep a tub at work and moisturize in the middle of the day. win.",2
"I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the daily two step pads from another supplier. glad I found this. I use this twice a week. skin is smoother, more even toned and pores are cleaner. highly recommend. I can't believe the price is so low and it lasts a long time!",3
I was looking for a cream bronzer that would last all day and give me that perfect contour chiseled cheeks and I found it. I have a difficult time with powder bronzers as it seems that they dont really last throughout the day on my skin. I love that I can apply this product and it gives me the perfect bronzed look and adds some much needed color to my face.,0
"I was looking for a deep dark red on my latest trip when the beauty advisor recommended this in 201.  I loved the color at first sight, and asked if I'd need a lip liner or something.  She assured me it wouldn't bleed/feather so no need.  \n\nWell, she's wrong.  It bled on me within 30minutes.  I tried a sugar scrub and moisturizing and yes it still bleeds.  Going to try a lip liner next, and if that still doesn't work, I just can't keep this",4
"I was looking for an effective applicator to set under eye concealer and also around the nose area. This was recommended by a sephora associate. I was skeptical because I tried so many brushes, beauty blender, and sponge. This was surprisingly effective. it picks up good amount of setting powder, the tapered end helps with the precision around the nose. Perfect!",2
"i was looking for a nice thick eye cream for nighttime. it is too thick for makeup/day use, and it does pill when I wake up in the morning a bit. that's ok for me. I've used others that are still greasy in the morning or too dry right away. this one is in between. I use an eye serum first and this on top. so far I cant tell if it has worked on my aging concerns, but i like its texture and it feels great to put on. i will say the formula is firmer than the picture though",4
"I was looking for a nude lipstick and tried this one in the store. After 4 hours of wearing, the color did not move or emphasize lines, my lips felt super comfortable. I know this is the one!!! Placed the order the same night with a few other colors and waiting for them to arrive.",2
"I was looking for hydration and found so much more! I use this instead of lip gloss, makes my lips so shiney, plump and full! You'll never find yourself frantically looking to moisturize cracked or dry lips ever again! After using regularly, you won't need it less and less, then find yourself wanting to wear it just for shine.",1
I was looking for lip products that do not dry out my lips. These trial-size lipsticks are moisturizing and glide on smoothly. My lips feel comfortable like there's nothing on. The colors work well for my skin tone. Desert Rose is really close to my natural lip color. Their mini size gives me a better chance of using them up.,2
"I was looking to switch to an oil free cleanser because I felt like my usual cleaners were making my lash extensions fall out faster. I have normal to combination skin with no real issues other than the occasional dryness. This stuff has a very pleasant smell and a little really does go a long way, but it unfortunately made me break out so I had to return it. My skin works really well with oil-based cleansers and creams so it could just be that its not used to it. I gave it a little over a week before I had to stop and go back to my regular product and my skin cleared back up. It has great reviews.. I really wanted to love it :(",4
"I was lucky enough to receive a full sized tube of this product from fab.fit.fun, so I didn't have to spend the $98 price tag. It's a fine eye cream - sure. But I really haven't noticed any difference that I wasn't already getting from my $30 eye cream. For the price, I was expecting a lot from this and unfortunately it missed the mark.",2
"I was nervous to try this product as I was thinking it would be really strong and my skin would have an adverse effect on my skin. The first step definitely was felt on my skin momentarily, but the second step neutralized the feeling. My skin felt soft after that. I don't know if it would improve my skin more than a sub $20 toner.",4
"I was never a great believer in primers until I tried a sample I received of the Becca First Light primer.  It is actually pretty unbelivable how it brightens your complexion without color or shine. Some days when I'm in a rush and forget to apply it, I can immediately tell by glancing in my rear view mirror...dull, dull, dull.  I'm now on my 3rd bottle! I highly recommend.",3
I was never interested in owing an ABH pallete until now. Great colors. Very unique pallete since I can actually use all 14 colors in the pallete. Amazing payoff and quality. Extremely versatile. This will probably be the only ABH pallete I will ever own.,4
I was not at all impressed with this mascara. My Cover Girl volumizing is 10x better at less the cost. My lashes were clumpy and I would have to clean up smudges around my eyes an hour or two after putting it on.,1
"I was not sure about this foundation the first few times I tried it.  I was used to a matte foundation with fuller coverage.  Although it was different than what I was used to, I was receiving compliments on my skin every time I used it.  I’ve been using it every day now for over a month, and I have absolutely fallen in LOVE.  The added benefit is that I swear my skin has improved with usage.  I use less foundation now, and my skin looks like skin, but better.",3
I was not sure what to get for my friend so i picked this Calendar to surprise her. She loved it. I knew these are sample size but great for someone who isn't familiar with Loccitane products. Also these are the perfect travelling size to pack for vacation. Good value!,1
"I wasn't expecting much from this but bought it anyway because I chopped off my hair after dyeing it and it looked terrible. After finishing my first bottle, I did notice how good, healthy, and longer my hair looked! My hair naturally grows fast compared to other people, but I wanted it to look long faster than usual. It also gave my hair its wavy look back, since it started looking straight-ish after dyeing it. Definitely recommend these! they're yummy.",4
I wasn't going to purchase as I watched videos saying that last years and this years is practically the same. That you don't need this one. I am glad I didn't listen as this one is different for me anyway. Very pigmented in my opinion with the colors I have used so far. Also the colors opened my eyes and I looked really bright eyed/awake/glowing. Whatever you want to call it. Even my husband mentioned how my eyes looked brighter and more awake. Even in photos it was a distinct difference. I really like this palette! It works great for me anyway! I didn't really feel it smelled like gingerbread though. Still 5 star worthy in my opinion. Happy holidays everyone!,0
"I wasn’t in need of a new eye mask so I am glad I received this complimentary for testing. This is a rich and creamy eye cream that can be used at night and in the day with the use of an spf. It’s very hydrating, I can’t wait to see how I look after a few weeks.",0
"I wasn't sure if I'd like this or not bc the only product I've used from glamglow was the dream duo I think, and it kinda broke me out but this moisturizer is great for my dry skin. I really needed something new for my winter skin and this stuff works. Also I've never used this mask which I can't believe bc my skins always on the drier side and I absolutely love it.",2
I wasn't sure if I was going to like these but they're honestly not bad. Tastes kind of like a sour apple candy. I don't get nearly enough gems in my diet so these are a welcome and early way to help. I don't know if they're giving me more energy or anything but I could care less because I know they're doing my body good.,1
I wasn’t sure what to expect but I am more than pleased!!!! I even have dry skin and this cleared my pores out and made it look more even toned and stopped a few blemishes in their tracks. Very happy! Reordering,3
I wasn't too happy with this body wash because it didn't completely clear my back acne or help that much. If I skipped a day of use my back would break out again. I have since been using the 2% salicylic acid body spray by Paula's Choice and my back is nearly clear! A higher acid percentage may be what I needed.,0
I was on the fence about this shade after swatching it on my hand but after purchase I applied on my lips after lining my lips with CT Lip Cheat in Foxy Brown. OMG! Its the perfect chocolate nude lippie on me. Has a lovely slightly rosey tone to it that doesnt appear ashy. Texture is quite creamy despite it being a matte formula and isnt drying on the lips. Very impressed and look forward to investigating more CT lippie shades in this formula.,3
"I was on the fence after read the previous reviews and bought one during the VIB sales. I'm soooooo glad that I did! The color is so beautiful and pigmented. My lips were dry and this lip gloss is super moisturized and not sticky at all. LOVE it! can't wait to purchase other colors! Nicely done, Pat McGrath Labs!",2
"I was originally looking for a tinted moisturizer for a little extra coverage. but NARS felt like it clogged my pores, and Laura Mercier didnt have enough coverage, Lancome skin feels so good made me look ashy, so I gave this a try expecting nothing... I was super impressed! I never found a foundation shade that matched me exactly. Also it looks like a filter on the skin and a little goes a long way.  I use serum and SPF underneath and it went on beautifully on top of these products. Also you dont even need to set it, and it feels VERY light weight on the skin. I love it!",0
"I was originally really drawn to this because of the beautiful shades as they're shown in photos. when I received the palette i was disappointed because in real life the colors are quite different. Even still, when swatched/worn on the eye the colors vary greatly. \n\nI have fair skin and two of the mattes barely show up on my skin, I can't imagine the mattes would work well across all skin tones. The formula for the mattes is powdery and you need a lot to get any kind of color payoff.\n\nThis palette excels with the shimmer shades though. If there was a quad of these shimmers I would recommend buying it. The formula is creamy and I don't notice excessive amounts of glitter/shimmer fallout across the face. They are long lasting, I didn't notice any kind of creasing throughout the day. \n\nFor me personally, this palette doesn't build a complete look. I would have preferred a deeper brown shade for depth or eyeliner. This palette would standout in smaller collections, but if you're someone who's used Charlotte, Natasha, Pat, this palette wouldn't standout among them.",1
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I received it as a sample with an online order. It feels like water in your hand and dries immediately on your skin. It doesn't linger but your skin feels moisturized.,0
"I was pretty skeptical at first given that after purchasing, my esthetician (and dear friend) told me the thing was made in China and probably only cost $20 tops...that said, once I brought it home and used it, I was totally sold. I can remember having purchased another silk pillow case from Amazon (one with great reviews) only to receive it in the make, feel it and immediately send it back. The Slip Pillowcase, however, is so soft, so comfortable, and in my opinion, worth it. So much so that I just bought a 2nd. I sleep better, I don't wake up with any sheet creases on my face, and it definitely helps with minimizing hair breakage. I personally like white sheets, however, I would recommend washing all of your makeup off and well if you want to keep the case clean. I don't wear any face makeup, however, if there is any mascara residue on my eyes, the pillow case will pick it up. Other than that, would highly recommend.",0
"I was previously using a Clarins eye cream which I really liked but decided to try something new. I went with this one as it had good reviews and was a good price. Have been using it about a week and have been happy with the results - my eye area was quite dry and now appears hydrated. My eyes are also less puffy. Haven't noticed much difference with my dark circles. I like the consistency of this cream, a little goes a long way. It is also fragrance free which is nice!",4
"I was quite worried about ordering this lipstick because of the reviews stating some of the shades received were not what was pictured. I was so happy when I received mine that the description was spot on. I love the formula -the color is gorgeous and the feel on the lips is gorgeous. I only needed one swipe to get even, creamy coverage. I have been looking for a nude beige shade to replace a clinique lipstick that was discontinued and ND's Michelle is perfect! I will definitely be buying other shades from this line.",3
"I was reading previous reviews. A bad review was due to its $9 price hike, which is totally inaccurate!  That person confused the Viseart Petite Pro palettes (8g of product @ $30) to the Viseart Edit palettes (12g of product @ $39). This new Edit palette is the same price as the Viseart Rose & Warm Edit. You ACTUALLY get 4g MORE EYESHADOW in the Edit palette vs the Petite for only $9. The Petite Edit price of 4g eyeshadow is $15,which means the Edit shoulove been $45 for 12g. However, it's only $39. This is a DEAL in comparison!",3
"I was really attracted to the colours because this palette is basically all my favourite eyeshadow shades in a nutshell, but the shimmer/metallics are a bit lacking. Thy're still pretty, but I have a Colourpop palette that's got much more reflective metallics.",0
I was really disappointed with this product.  it went on as a thick white paint and my shadow went on as normal but at the end of the day I had horrible creasing.  I do have oily lids but it was like I had no primer on at all.,4
"I was really excited for this product. I got Bright Lover, and put it on as directed, and then let the rest soak in over night. My skin immediately looked dewy, calm, and ""glassy"", and it was amazing. Until the next morning. I woke up with several, painful, under-the-skin pimples. I would just be cautionary if you have sensitive skin; especially for the price. Now I have to deal with all of these bumps. :(",0
I was really excited to try these once I got them and once I did they didnt disappoint me. They really do work. I just used them on my smile lines and I could most definitely see a little difference. I've never done any kind of micro needling so I was really curious about these. I could barely feel them once I started pushing on them like they said to do. My only complaint is that i wish they came with more in them. If they always only come with 6 I feel like your gonna be spending a lot of money just to keep this part of your routine.,0
"I was really excited to try this as a lot of people love it. However, I found the formula to be very sticky on skin and it was very uncomfortable to me. It also made me break out and general my skin felt unhealthy.",4
"I was really excited to try this. I've used it 4 times now. However,  I'm not impressed at all. My skin showed no changes.  I didnt even feel the tingling when applied, and I DEFINITELY applied enough product and left it on long enough.",2
"I was really excited to try this out because it's such an icon. I've used it for about a month and I don't understand what all the fuss is about. it's not bad, it gets the job done. but it's in no way worth the price, it feels extremely average to me. it doesn't leave my skin as soft as I expected for how popular it is. I wouldn't recommend this because there are so many better options for a reasonable price.",4
"I was really excited to try this palette, especially given the great reviews, but unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. I don't like fragrance and it has a synthetic peach smell. There was hardly any color payout and the eyeshadow was chalky and difficult to blend. Also the colors weren't nearly as flattering as I'd thought they were going to be. I'm returning mine.",2
I was really excited to try this toner because I love Belif products. The toner did leave my skin more hydrated but also left it tacky. I'm going to try this again in the winter.\n\nI received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.,2
I was really hopeful for this mascara. However after the first use it comes out in clumps. Once it’s on there’s really bad flaking later on in the day. I didn’t do a crazy amount of applications just two applications and it still flakes. It does give you length but nothing too dramatic.,0
"I was really interested in this palette and wanted to love it. Although the quality of the colors are nice with good color pay out... after putting them on my eyes, they just appear really muddy. I want to love this palette since it's really nice UD quality but I can only give it three stars.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying this toner because I'm always looking out for ways to bring moisture to my very dry skin. When I first started to use it (a couple of nights a week, alternating with acid toners), it left my skin feeling hydrated and I could almost feel a layer of moisture sitting on my skin. Unfortunately, after a few consecutive days of using this toner, I broke out horribly and noticed large pores and bumps all over my face (and I definitely do not have breakout-prone skin)! Based on my experience I would not recommend this product.",0
I was recommended this one after finding out that the Sephora near me stopped selling the one I used to use. I'm very impressed that the sales associate knew exactly what I was looking for and directed me to something in my price range and better than the one I used to use. 5 stars for the product and for that sales associate!!,0
"I was recommended this product 2 months ago by a Sephora associate. I've been using as directed daily...and I noticed this product actually dried out my eye area, giving me fine lines where I didn't have them before! Also, I think it's lightened my under eye area, not in a good brightening sort of way, but in a horrible shadow-enhancing manner. I'm in my mid-40's, with generally good but dry skin. This product is a disaster. I wish I had been looking more closely at what it had been doing over time.",2
"I was searching through my purchase history and this powder popped up 4 times. she is everything I need in a setting powder. I use her to bake and lightly set my foundation and concealer. for reference I am a combo-oily skin, and this stuff still keeps my makeup looking good we'll into the 8-10hr mark. They last me about 6 months using it regularly (5-6 days a week). definitely a great value and my HG powder",1
"I was sent a complimentary trial size version of this from the company to try and review. Once again, their products do not disappoint. I love the natural green/fresh scent this has to it. It smells very similar to their green cream.\n\nThe mist is very fine and coats the face evenly. I think this has helped with my redness, especially around my cheek and nose area. Be sure to shake the product first as the oils separate from the rest of the product.\n\nI love to use this in my skincare routine before I do my makeup but it's such a light spray, you could use it throughout the day!",0
"I was sent the,  Alpine Berry Water Cream. Miracle Seed Essence and Wild Seed Firming Serum from Primera and Influenster.\n\nI have extremely dry skin, with dry patches. My skin is also VERY sensitive. Which means a lot of super moisturizing products have ingredients that either give me a rash or break me out. I love trying new skin care products. I am a bit of skin care junky. But its to the determent of my skin a lot of the times.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to have no reactions to the Alpine Berry Water Cream. Miracle Seed Essence or the Wild Seed Firming Serum. On top of that, they have been leaving my skin feeling SOOOO unbelievably soft, with no dry patches or irritation.\n\nThe Miracle Seed Essence is hydrating and soothing and am loving applying it after my toner. Looking forward to seeing how it could possibly help with my uneven texture.",0
"I was sent this from influenster for free to sample and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I love this foundation. It is sheer, but that it my preferred formulation. The shade I ended up with is a smidge too light for me, but it should work out when I lose my summer tan. This foundation brings out the best in your skin and it looks very natural. I also felt it held up well-I wore it to work for a couple 12 hour shifts and didnt feel like it faded much.",1
"I was sent this product to try for free from Influenster.\n\nSo, usually I use felt tip pen eyeliners, so it's been awhile since I used a brush.\n\nThis is somewhere between a brush and a felt tip....so it requires a learning curve.\n\nAfter messing up once, i got perfect even wings on both eyes and the pigment wasnt patchy so I didnt have to go back over it.\n\nit stayed put for almost 8 hours, but I had a cold and rubbed my eyes alot so I ended up with a patchy right eye.\n\nI also love the purple tube. it makes it easier to find the product in my makeup bag.",1
"I was skeptical about this but I bought it when I was having breakouts out of desperation. I'm very surprised it helped me clear up acne, and I would say that when I'm starting to break out then I'll use it. When my face was clear, I would still get occasional breakouts but it helped handle it better. For a budget price, I would say this is pretty good for a try if you have acne-prone skin.",0
"I was skeptical at first since I've never used a mask that doesn't require me to wash it off after applying. I have extremely dry skin especially during the winter time. I have to say though, my skin definitely felt hydrated the next day. It didn't feel weird sleeping with the mask. The consistency feels more of a lotion/cream so it doesn't leave a oily finish.",0
"I was skeptical, but this one really works. It is only $7.20 if you put it on your face and you hate it you're still not out that much money but I have to tell you it made a huge difference the very 1st time I used it my skin immediately felt smoother and softer after and it only gets better from there",4
I was skeptical but this really worked!  After just 8 weeks I saw significant results - even my lower lashes were huge!  Left side eye lashes are not quite as long as on my right but I'm confident they'll even out.  Worth the price.,2
I was skeptical getting this product as I used caffeine gels before and were so sticky. This is rich but light and absorbs fast. Keeps skin moisturized with a hint of vanilla. Not sure yet about skin tightening but I like how it feels.,3
"I was skeptical if I would get much use out of this palette since I'm fair skinned, but the color range suites my skin tone well! I use the darker highlights in between my highlight and contour for a nice transition! They are also very pigmented and can be built up.",0
"I was skeptical of the concealer at first due to the watery consistency but I was pleasantly surprised! It went on smoothly with maximum coverage, didn’t settled into fine lines, and lasted the Texas heat! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1
I was skeptical on this product at 1st because I adore the brand but the reviews were not great. When I would 1st apply the foundation I felt like I instantly loved it. By about 20 minutes later I could feel it just sitting like an oil on my face. It made me look shiny and greasy. It also made me look like I was having a constant acne breakout which is wild because my skin was clear. I was so ready to love this product but sadly it was not for me. I would reccomend it if you have dry skin only,0
"I was slightly hesitant when I purchase the set but when I received my package I was pleasantly surprised. The big bag is a decent size I can travel safely with a lot of pallets if I choose to and it's padded. the included two mesh makeup bags are also fantastic, I can really put a lot into the them. the mash is high quality btw. and the included brush holder also has zipper on the other side the elastic is really good at holding the makeup brushes snuggly. I'll end this review by saying that it is worth the investment and plus it is for a good cause.",1
"I was so excited about this pencil, I wanted to love it. I am a victim of overplucking back in the 80s so I need to pencil in a great deal. I used the lighter shade and it ran out in about 2 weeks. This is not a good value for your money.i would not repurchase.",3
"I was so excited for this product after my best friend purchased it , so excited that I looked outside for the package everyday until it arrived . I started doing some swatches and fell in love with the color & how the color shifted . Once I started using it more often I noticed alot of fall out , to the point where there was glitter all over my face . It was really chunky & not smooth& every color has a pink tone to it so if pink is your thing then this is definelty for you ! I wouldn't use this for everyday looks , mostly with my burgundy/pink looks . Don't  get me wrong this product does not disappoint , just wish it would have been more smooth & had a different finish & not had as much fall out to the point where anything under my cheek bones had glitter . \nI still live for this product , just had more expectations for it being 45$ . Overall , it's a good product .",4
"I was so excited for this product. Reviews were glowing, pictures and videos looked flawless, and the price was fantastic for how much product you get! This was a huge let down.\n\nFirst, the formula creases like crazy. I have drugstore concealers that crease less. It settles into lines around my eyes that I didn't even know I had. Setting powder just makes it worse, to be honest.\n\nSecond, it's a patchy mess! With multiple tries to smooth it out (with different primers, foundations, used bare), it always ends up smudging and breaking apart, making my face look super cakey. It just refuses to blend into the skin, and stay there. \n\nIn the end, I'm left frustrated and annoyed at a product I was hoping would be a saving grace.",0
"I was so excited to buy this, heard great things about it. There is so little product for what you pay. The lip stick broke off immediately, they are pretty much 3 sample sizes for that amount. Going to return, not worth your money!",1
"I was so excited to get the trial size in the mail, and I washed off my foundation and tried it on the moment I ripped open the box. For some reason, it emphasized all the texture on my face including my pores, dry patches and fine lines. Formula is a little thick and dried fairly quick so I had to work fairly fast. By the end of the day, I saw some separation and had quite a bit of shine. The colour was also much too warm for my skin tone, even though it's a neutral. Again, I wanted to love it, but it wasn't for me.",4
"I was so excited to get this product, I have normal skin & wanted to add a little more moisture with the weather getting colder. This product trashed my skin, it made my skin SOOO DRY, it changed the whole texture of my skin. Now I have dry,  bumpy, flakey skin. I have never experienced this with any product & was so disappointed!!! I wished I would have never used this product. Drunk Elephant really messed my skin up & was very disappointed, especially for the price point...",3
"I was so excited to receive this complimentary mascara for my review! My opinion...IT IS AMAZING! My lashes are fuller, longer, beautifully dark AND curled with Damn Girl! I didn't even use my eyelash curler! I have used many mascaras over the years and while I do still like them, THIS one surpasses them. I was pleasantly surprised with the results after just 2 coats! It is not sticky. It didn't smudge, dried quickly, lashes were separated, volumized and curled.. everything I want in a mascara! The packaging is gorgeous too. I highly recommend!   Thank you Sephora!",3
"I was so excited to receive this in a Vox Box as I am a general fan of Peter Thomas Roth skincare.  This cream did not disappoint!  My skin is normal, but tends to be a bit dehydrated from retinol use.  At 35, and working in an office in NYC, general aging, but especially from blue light and air pollution, is a concern for me.  The cream has an almost balm like texture that melts into my skin as I spread it.  I was surprised by how little I needed to cover my entire face.  It had no detectable fragrance, and kept my skin plumped and hydrated all day, which is a challenge and in a New York winter!  I wasn’t familiar with a “barrier cream” at first, but seeing what it can do visibly while knowing it also is protecting me from environmental agers makes this a must have!",1
I was so excited to receive this pallette!!! The colors were perfect for me. The package is very cheap and plastic. The colors are completely blotchy and sheer. They do not blend out with ease. I wanted to love this so much. :(,3
"I was so excited to see that this set was on sale, because the full sized bottles are so expensive. With the smaller sizes, I was able to try all the hyped products. \nThe Rose Gold Elixir is my absolute favorite. It gives you a subtle glow from within, without making you too oily and when mixed with a complexion product gives you a super dewy finish. \nThe Volcanic Elixir and Unicorn Essence both have somewhat of a strong fragrance so if that's something you're concerned with, you may not like these. And definitely don't use these products the way that Instagram videos show, because they aren't meant to be used like that. A few drops is usually plenty. \nThe full sizes would definitely be a splurge, but worth it if you can.",0
I was so excited to see this limited edition tarte palette. When I finally got it in the mail I was so excited on line the swatches looked so beautiful the package looks stunning and I was excited that it came with a brush eyeliner and mascara. Anyway I got it in the mail obviously the packaging was gorgeous I was stunned by the sequence and sparkles and beautiful colors. This was a dream. But sadly my dreams were shattered by the lack of quality  Of the make up. The formula was obviously very cheap and not good and it was just awful. Our use the Mac Cosmetics pot paints I primer and so it wasn't the primer that failed me because that is always a holy Grail any time it fails its cuz the eye shadow.  So I go to dip in with the brush a came with and instantly 1st impressions so much fall out in the pan!!!!  I've literally had to pack on so much product with my brush and put it on my eyes to get a little bit of pigment in so after a while of finally perfecting my look I finished the rest of my makeup said it in and when off to go about my day. Literally after only an hour my make up look awful all the eye shadow had fallen out I had sparkles all over my face and the red color I was using bled and leaked all over my face. Honestly what you're paying for and big hype about this I palette is honestly just the packaging the product itself is horrible and I would not recommend this for anyone seriously such a just appointment I usually love tarte usually don't have a problem with their products but this time they did me wrong\nTHIS IS A FLOP!,4
I was so excited to see this set at Sephora in time for the holiday sale! I like all of the colors very much. The champagne is more of a mid-tone on my fair skin. It sheers out easily for a quick day look or to balance a dark or bright lip color and it layers for a more intense metallic finish. The gold is gorgeous and can also be worn lightly or intensely. I can wear it to work or pull off sparkly party look. The silver is slightly trickier to pull off lightly and I found it works better for me with a brush than my fingers. It also layers well. A lot of eye shadows aggravate my eczema and some can cause and itchy scaly burning flare-up. I've never been able to wear eyeshadow without a primer but just for fun I tried with these and they worked okay. They don't cause any reaction at all. The last about four hours which is far longer than most products without primer. Any creasing can be cleaned up and blended out with a finger. It's pretty much bulletproof with a primer underneath. I ordered a couple more colors and I'm really excited.,3
I was so excited to try Lancet Skincare Clarifying Detox Mask with Green Tea + 3% Sulfur as I love trying out new masks. I am in my late 30's and have started to get acne again and this mask helped my face clear up so we'll. I like the smell and it helps me relax while it cleanses my face from impurities that are causing the acne. It also leaves my face feeling very smooth. I am definitely buying more.,2
"I was so excited to try this, as someone online had stated it was a good skincare line. I was shocked upon receiving it at how all three products have such a strong floral fragrance. After testing them out on the back of my hand I now have a headache from the scent. This is going nowhere near my face! It is going back to Sephora!",0
"I was so excited to try this because I love Origins products and this got some really solid reviews. I am genetically predisposed to puffy under eyes, so I am always looking for that miracle product. This was most definitely not it. \n\nAny eye cream that uses microscopic shimmering particles to ""brighten"" is cheating. The particles just reflect light, resulting in the ""appearance"" of brighter under eyes. It's just a smoke screen though. And there was zero de-puffing. I will be returning this product tout suite. \n\n2 stars because the texture is nice, and it's not thin enough to get into my eyes.",0
"I was so excited to try this cleanser because I love the Cloud cream from this brand but... the first time using feeling slapped into my whole face!!!\nThis is the first time I see such a greasy cleanser, takes tons of gallons of water but still can't wash away the cleanser on my face. On that hard progress I have to stand the horrible scent from this cleanser, smells like ""new shoes or old plastic chair"".",1
I was so excited to try this cleanser but it didn't work for me. The cleanser is definitely non-stripping but it doesn't clean very well.  I normally use it on days when I don't wear makeup and it doesn't remove all of my impurities. After cleansing I go over my skin with a toner and the cotton ball will still have impurities on it.  I wouldn't use it for a double cleanse either cause I don't think it removes all the oil from the makeup remover.,1
"I was so excited to try this eye cream as my skin is normally dry and I notice dryness in my eye area! First impressions are the nice thickness of the cream and the amazing smell of peony - smells just like the flower! I really liked the consistency of The Silk Peony eye cream, it went on smooth and the smell was not overbearing. I do not normally like powerful long lasting fragrances in products. Regular makeup application when as normal and my foundation and concealer under my eyes lasted all day long. I applied again at night time before bed. When I woke up, my eyes were so soft. I can tell it gently smooths and softens the eye area. I'm afraid I've noticed my eye area ageing and I'm excited to see the results after 4 weeks, as the product states the time it will take to notice a difference. 10 out of 10! \n\nI received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1
"I was so excited to try this foundation  but sadly did not work for me.  Used one pump It settled in my laugh lines, around nose and remained tacky all day I applied a small amount of powder but it did not help, tried a few times also with primer.  The longevity is good tho and the finish is nice too. But had to return.",2
"I was so excited to try this. I had to stop using it (within a week) because it was making my eyes dry, itchy, red, and irritated. Not worth it! I will not be purchasing an eyelash growth serum with so many chemicals ever again.",4
I was so excited to try this product because I ADORE the moisturizer from the same line. the mask does absorb quite quickly and does not leave a film on your skin which was really nice. but every sing time I've used this mask it has made me breakout. I even patch tested  it on several specific locations on my skin and whenever I applied it I would get these angry red breakouts that appear the next day. I dont have sensitive skin nor do I breakout easily so this was quite a disturbing shock to me. alas this product did not work with my skin. I will continue to use the moisturizer though.,4
"I was so excited to try this (received a sample through Beauty Insider points), but was surprised at how bad it smelled and then ended up breaking out terribly all over my forehead, jawline, etc. Took a solid week to fix the mess. I'll just continue to use Kiehls - no breakouts, no bad smell and it actually helps minimize fine lines.",1
"I was so excited when the mini came out, I've wanted to try the larger one for a while but didnt want to spend the money. This stuff smells soooo good, it's VERY shimmery and you can add on layers to fit the mood. The only reason why I didnt give it five stars is that because of the almost ""glossy"" look, it never really completely dry down (especially when you put a TON on), but other than that I love it",0
"I was SO happy when this mini came out, I was eyeing the full version for months before that. I am so impressed with this pallete, it is buttery, the shimmers are super pigmented, and it has colors to use for everyday or glam moments. One of my favourite palettes at the moment!",0
"I was soooo excited when this came out. I've tried all foundations out there. The first time I put it on I put it with the flawless filter and it separated on my skin and got patchy and creased, looked terrible. I tried it a second time without it and its still very patchy and creased, settled into my pores, and separated and got oily. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or if this product is just that terrible. This is not my first time applying make up and I actually consider myself a professional when it comes to make up. Overall I have tried it out 10 different ways with make up brush, beauty blender doesn't make a difference. It is a full coverage make up so I use very little because if not you will look like you are wearing a mask, it's that bad. Even my husband commented that my make up was off. Thanks Charlotte VERY DISAPPOINTED with this foundation.",1
I was so surprised at how tiny this tube is. It is a sample size. The eye primer works which is why I gave it 2 stars but the price is ridiculous for the amount to receive.  Usually BM is priced well but not this. Very disappointed.,4
I was so surprised to see so many low ratings!  My 3 girls and I absolutely love the COCONUT HEAVENLY scent and the moisture is a much higher level than the  bum bum cream I also own!  j will be ordering more for sure!,3
"I was super excited to try this, and even more disappointed by the results. I put this on with my normal skincare and makeup routine around 9 this morning. It took three coats to make any difference  in my eyelashes, but after the third coat my lashes looked natural and pretty, so I went with it.  I had a pretty laid back Saturday.  My normal mascara (YSL The Curler) would have held up all day, but this was wearing off by 4 in the afternoon, leaving me with raccoon smudges and no mascara left on my eyelashes. I can't believe how bad this is. My YSL is only $4 more, so I'll be sticking with it. This one is going in the trashcan.",3
"I was super excited to try this, only to be disappointed. There wasn't very much in the tube and it ran out super fast. It didnt stay on my lips for long and didn't hydrate my lips enough. Obly upside for me was that it was not sticky, it felt very smooth. Would not buy again!",2
"I was super excited to try this palette after so many great reviews. I was not disappointed!! the bronzer and highlight look great on my fair skin tone. The mini brush that comes with is great too! like other reviews have mentioned the packaging could be executed better, but honestly the quality of the product and added brush make it totally worth it.",0
"I was super excited to try this product. I applied it with my fingers and it went on seamlessly. It could be buildable too. Unfortunately, after a few hours it faded. Even with a primer and setting spray, it didn't last long. I was expecting a better product from Bare Minerals.",1
"I was super excited when they came out with this gloss because I wear Pillow Talk lip liner and lipstick all the time. The gloss is very pigmented, and the colour is perfect. It doesn't bleed outside the lip lines, and it gives a nice natural glossy shine. I think this would be the perfect gloss for the office because it's not a wet looking gloss, it's more day-to-day appropriate. I personally really love this gloss and I definitely recommend it.",1
"I was super intrigued by these palettes, especially the small one with the pressed glitters so I picked this up. I got this in store so I came straight home to do a review lol normally I'm not the biggest fan of China made holiday palettes BUT this is right in line with TF quality. Seriously this collection is soooo good! They blend amazingly, are super pigmented and I even loved the face palette.... I just can not recommend this enough. Shadows are chalky at all nor do they have alot of fall out. Check it out if u wanna see it in action or some inspo for a tutorial @ Vanessa Elle",4
I was surprised and impressed to find that this highlight perfectly complimented my medium to dark skin tone. This compact (in my oppinion) is not travel friendly because of its large size but because of this I'm loving  the mirror!  Also I'm guessing they made it big because it's in all body highlight so I can't really mark down a star for that.,4
"I was surprisingly pleased with this deodorant despite it being ""natural"" and without aluminum. I live in a climate where it's quite hot in summer but i work a desk job so I'm not really outdoors a lot gettin' sweaty. It's very refreshing once on and will keep you odor free for the day if you apply twice daily. however, it won't cut down on the perspiration. I wouldn't recommend it for more active lifestyles but it's fine and even enjoyable to use when you're chillin.",1
"I was told that this would help my oily skin, but the product left my skin worse than before. My face became uncontrollably oily, and sticky. It felt like it just sat on top of my face, never really being absorbed into my skin. \nI liked the way it smelled though.",0
I was traveling last Thanksgiving when the Airline sent my bag to the wrong city. I had no MakeUp!!!  So I went straight to Sephora to pick up the few things that I could not live without.  The Clinique Mascara was suggested by someone that worked at Sephora.  \n I had been trying to find a waterproof mascara that would not melt on my eyes by 3pm. Finally this is the one.  It goes on clean and my eyelashes are perfectly separated. I use a primer first for a really great look! When I get home at night my eyelashes are as good as they were at 9am.  LOVE IT,3
"I was unsure about this mask because the reviews are a bit up and down, but i really like it. I've used other over night masks before and they feel really heavy and oily on the skin so I dont love them. This mask feels so rich when you put it on, and then sinks in so quickly! It felt like nothing was on my skin, and in the morning my skin felt great. \n\nThe eye mask- This is a lot plushier and soft than I thought it would be. Very comfy, but if your head is on the bigger side it might feel tight on you. The quality is really nice for a basically a free gift!",0
"I was unsure how good this palette will be for my darker skintone (NC44), but they actually looked really great and I can use all of them and they don't look ashy on me. I was pleasantly surprised and was blown away by the quality of these shadows. They blend like a dream. One of the best eyeshadow formulas I have used. The matte shadows are simply amazing and I wish there are more matte  shades. CT metallic/shimmer shadows are lovely and they don't emphasize my eyelid texture. I can't say enough good things about these shadows, it is so easy to get great eyelooks. Also, this holiday packaging is so nice and sleek and very easy to travel with.",1
I was using benefits dark brown brow zings like everyday this is faster to use and better results.  the size is perfect if your looking for something that works for you to try.  I'm going to buy full size products from now on.,1
I was using the treatment essence and the RNA face cream and wow did my skin change.  My skin was glowing and moisturized that even my friend noticed the difference.  I don't even need to put any heavy makeup since my skin was glowing.  I really did enjoy this product a lot.  This is definitely my go-to skin care line whenever I want something to give me good and fast results.,1
I was very disappointed in this product.  I am over 50 and have dry skin and small wrinkles around my eys.  I always use an eye moisturizer and had high hopes for this eye.  It did not always apply easily and actually was an irritant.,4
"I was very disappointed with the performance of this lippie.  I loved the formula and how light it was on my lips while still providing super pigmented color.  However, after a couple of hours (with no eating or drinking) it had completely faded to a sad line around my lips.  I don't want to have to reapply lip color every hour, so I returned these.  I also bought the Bloom color, which is a bright red, almost orangey.",3
"I was very disappointed with this. I have oily T-zone, a good foundation for me would last 4hrs, at least, before I need to do oil control. This foundation was not only oily by hour 3, but it also started to break apart a little and settled into my smile line in an obvious way. It did not ""self-refresh"" as it would claim for me. Once the oil started setting in, the foundation looked a little heavy. It does have pretty good coverage; one layer would cover eighty percent of my acne scars.",1
I was very disappointed with this product and should of just purchased my normal tried and true Origins Ginzing Eye Cream. This product has a weird smell and feel to it. It also seems to dry my eyes out. I will not purchase ever again. Buyer beware if you have dry or sensitive skin as this does not seem to work well with those skin concerns.,1
I was very disappointed with this product. I love using Peter Thomas Roth products so I thought I'd give this one a try. I have dry skin and was just looking for a tinted sunscreen. This does not apply nicely at all. It feels cakey and made my skin feel drier. I would not recommend.,4
"I was very excited about this primer. I got a sample size with my points and after reading the reviews I was betting I was going to purchase this after using my sample. However, this made me very extremely dry all day. It was not moisturizing. It feels like a silicone primer and I didn't see any ""glow"" on my skin. My makeup also looked very cakey.",0
I was very excited to try the burgundy but was also disappointed as I couldn't even get enough out of the ink side to line both eyes.   Black and brown seem to be working fine but the burgundy was a real disappointment bc it was so beautiful for the one eye I actually was able to use it for.,2
"I was very excited to try this at Sephora as my bestfriend and oldest daughter can't stop raving about it. I initially got matched with #5 but it was way too light for my liking. I went ahead for the 7 to kinda match my neck. Honestly, I might have been a 6, 6.5 the most. \nAnyway, I was very dis-appointed as the day progressed. with this foundation, I COULD SEE ALL MY FINE LINES AND LITTLE WRINKLES!!! everytime I look in the mirror I'm like, why do I look older??!!!!!! I could see my crows feet!!UGH!\n\nI'm sticking back to my current foundation that HIDES my imperfection and not cakey. I'm using my Orce.",2
"I was very excited to try this mascara and it did deliver on giving you volume in just a couple coats, but this mascara will run at the simple thought of a tear. The weatherman can say the word ""rain"" and this mascara will run. absolutely horrible. I continued to use it for awhile but ended up throwing away half a tube and going back to my tried-and-true favorite because this mascara just isn't worth it.",1
"I was very excited to try this palette, I'm all about nudes and this colour layout seemed right up my alley! I love the packaging, its very pretty, sturdy, has a mirror (always a plus). The sizes of the pans are descent. The colours are great and can work in any combinations... In theory. I found that these are very pigmented, but not really easy to blend. I'm a master of blending the eyeshadow on my eyes and this did not work no matter what I tried. The matt colours look different in the pans but when applied there is barely any difference. I was disappointed as this is my first Huda product and I would return it but I already used it and didn't save the packaging.",1
"I was very excited to try this product! I am obsessed with skin care and I have a skin routine that keeps my skin soft and clear, so anytime I try something new I dont make any other changes,  that way I know exactly what is working and what is not. This made my skin red and left little bumps all over my face, it was horrible! I am so happy that it didnt last long but it was awful. Also the smell is terrible!",4
"I was very hesitant to try these out at first after reading some of the reviews, but after going back ans forth so many times I gave in and I'm soooo glad I did! I think people who talk about these shadows being heavy are not using them correctly. I dab a few spots on my lid and blend it out and the results are AMAZING! They are very quick drying so you have to work fast. Bubblebath is so beautiful.  I also purchased private jet, faux far, and double tap. The glitter side is very versatile it can be used to enchance the color or as liner. Huda very rarely disappoints! LOVEEE",4
I was very impressed with this kit! Perfect for travel with TSA approved sizes. The Drunk Elephant balm is full size. Good way to sample different products before you commit to full size. Skincare items are clean and healthy for your skin.,4
"I was very intrigued for this eyeliner back when Tati reviewed this on her channel, that was back in 2016 and after that I have only purchased this liquid liner, no need to try others anymore, this is a holy grail product. Apart that it is very user friendly, very black and is very long lasting on the lids, I am just amazed that it just won't dry out. I have repurchased this product once or twice a year not because it dries out, but just out of sanitary reasons. I believe in turn it is more cost friendly than other $20 liquid liners that might be good but dry out after a month of usage. However, keep in mind that the brush tip does fray a little bit, but I just cut out very carefully those little frayed hairs and it's good to go.",0
I was visually stunned when I opened the outer box! Just the outer itself is so beautiful. Open up to reveal jaw-dropping  highly pigmented shades and out of this world foils! Too pretty to use...almost!,1
I was watching a tutorial and she was showing off the original version of the brushes.  As soon as I saw the fender bender I immediately put it in my cart.  I did find the angled blending brush a bit of a learning curve.  first time using it went on a little patchy but by the second eye I had it down.,1
"I was worried about being able to use this after reading all the reviews! I tried it without reading the instructions and failed. I read the instructions and it’s the best thing ever!! You have to use both hands, turn the knobs and keep the move the “flat” side against your face. It plucks all your little hairs and you can feel it. It startled me at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s addicting.",2
"I was worried that so many pastels without a true dark shade would be boring but this is a really lovely selection of shades and they all compliment each other. You have to make sure to use a light hand when applying because the product is so soft too much is messy and wasteful but a tiny bit goes a long way and lasts all day. The Velvet packaging really does get dirty quickly but, if you're worried about that don't stuff it in your makeup bag. This will be another ABH palette I will use until it's all gone.",2
"I was wowed by this. I am a student with a full-time job, needless to say, I have constant dark circles. This diminishes them but looks natural. I look like me, just a bit better. A bit more awake and well. This is not a concealer, but it works better than any concealer I have ever tried and it matches my skin tone (I have an odd one). Every eye product creases on me, this one barely does. The key is to not use too much. Like, the size of a cooked grain of rice.",1
"I wear this almost daily in the winter. It is super moisturizing and keeps my skin from getting flaky. I like the tint, keeps one from having a white cast. I can't wear it in the summer though, I tend to get too oily with it.",2
"I went back and forth on this several times before I pulled the trigger... SO GLAD I went for it! The colors are totally wearable on my med/warm skin tone. The Living Luminizer was much more flattering than I thought it would be. Since I was traveling I wanted to pack light and leave my eye makeup at home, so I used the bronzer as shadow. This was NOLA in July, so the kit was put to the test for sure! I can't say enough. SO good!",3
"I went into Sephora looking for something different to exfoliate my dry sensitive skin. I walked up to a employee asking for a sample of the Drunk Elephant BabyFacial to see if the high reviews held water. I explained to her how my skin is extremely sensitive and I have only tried physical natural exfoliating scrubs like Olehenriksen walnut scrub. She explained to me that finding the right chemical peel is crucial to skin type. And with mine being so sensitive, I was using the wrong one. Apparently the scrub I was using causes micro tears in the skin and can lead to more dryness and wrinkles! She said Drunk Elephant may be too strong for me and lead me to the Peter Thomas Roth section. She grabbed this silver bottle and asked to see my hand. She cleansed my hand and dried it and started rubbing this product on in a nice even layer. She talked to me more about the ingredients while this stuff sat on my hand for about 2 minutes and then said ""Now watch."" My jaw hit the floor. She was literally wiping clumps of dead skin off the back of my hand. The proof was incredible! I compared it to my other hand after she rinsed it with water and I could see the results after 1 application. I walked to the checkout with a bottle in hand immediately. I just used it for the first time on my face and wow...just wow! No redness, no irritation, just visibly much better looking skin. Soft and smooth and GLOWING! I will buy this from now on religiously. This product has officially changed my skincare routine and I will never look back!",1
I went into sephora to try the vanishing veil foundation and a rep told me it wasn't that good she immediately matched me perfectly to becca driftwood I have combo skin and she applied it on me it stayed the whole freakin day and didn't move more hydrating then Esté Lauder double wear which dried me out and becca is lighter and FULL COVERAGE vegan and cruelty free.,3
"I went on a journey to fine an amazing essence; reading reviews; watch video reviews on YouTube, literally testing on my skin!! This product wins. Less blemishes and I glow. I still tried others but came right back.",2
I went through a full sized bottle. It's more of a great body fragrance rather than a real moisturizer. The classic Moroccanoil scent is amazing! Great for summer if you want your skin to glow and smell amazing. You would have to use something else as well on your legs or they will show dryness.,1
I went through two bottles and absolutely loved what it did for my skin. The time between the first and second purchase I saw a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin. On the third bottle it started to not have the same effect. I'm not sure if my skin got used to it or I got a bad batch. I'm trying something else for now but will probably try this again after.,1
"I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT! I absolutely love this primer and have tried so many. Reasons why I like it: It makes my skin look airbrushed and flaws. You can use it with or without makeup. I use with makeup. The tiny particles in it somehow work magic so that you have a beautiful gorgeous canvas. It is not super matte but gives a pretty matte finish which I love. It smells good. It is clean at Sephora so that's always a perk if you're into that. I love that it has Vitamin C and can definitely tell my complexion is ""brighter"". I've gotten multiple compliments from people when using this with Estee Lauder double-wear. THIS WILL NOT BUDGE! I set with Too Faced Peach loose powder and the combo of the three makes my skin soooo flawless. I will be stocking up on this as it will be my holy grail. If you are on the fence with this, please get a sample or better yet buy it. SO worth the money! I love it.",0
"I will never say no to a good mist. Honestly I was a bit hesitant to try this because it claims ti have a dewy finish. I tend to lean towards matte finishes. But after trying this out, the fine mist gives me a natural subtle dewy glow that isnt too shiney but just a natural finish. It goes great over makeup to set my makeup as well as plump and hydrate my skin. This has a light scent that I can't quite describe but its pleasant and subtle and dissipates once applied. Overall I really love this mist, especially since its packed with amazing ingredients!",1
I will not be repurchasing as I'm trying to find fragrance free alternatives but this smells so so luxurious and amazing. If you are sensitive to scent I'd say this is pretty strong but I'm not so I loved it. It was lightweight and soaked into the skin but very hydrating. My skin looked and felt amazing.,4
"I will preface this by saying that I am not a neutral eyeshadow lover.  That said, I've used the smoky obsessions little Huda square and I thought that was lovely and worth the cost.  I still regifted it to a friend.  This Bobbi Brown palette had less options, formulas, and colors that that palette and it's more expensive.  Not worth it.  I made a couple lovely looks with this and the shadows did stay very well throughout the day, but there are less costly options for the same or better quality.",2
"I will say the scent wasn't terrible to me the first go round with product, and I did want to try the new version,, first impression,,, couldn't tell a major difference, but I guess it is less buttery scented, maybe",2
"I wish I could give this a 5 star\n but I was so disappointed with this. it was too liquidy , it made my lips go red (like how chapped lips would look ) and it transferred too easily . it didnt stay in place . had my lips hurting for about 2 days . I loved loved the color . just wish I could have used it. but had to return it.....",0
"I wish I could give this concealer 10 stars...it's just that good. I have been looking for my Holy Grail concealer for years now.  Nars? Tried it, liked it. Too Faced? Tried it, liked it. Shape Tape? Meh. But this one? WOW. Covers what I need covered, blends seamlessly, doesn't give away my age, and doesn't crease.",3
"I wish they would change the formula on this to make them be not so wet, if that makes sense. Raisin is one of my top five favorite colors of lipstick on me. The issue is that the formula slides around a lot and also in turn makes you need to keep reapplying it over and over as well as checking to make sure it hasn't slipped around your chin, teeth etc.  Forget about drinking though a straw or even talking for 2 hours because it just wont be there.  If they could make this be the same color, but just dry the formula down to a matte MAC type lipstick, or a Pat Mgrath lipstick then this would be PERFECT.  I used this brand and color for years.  I remember back in the 90's you could go into a Walmart or target and pick this brand up in lipstick,  to eyeshadows etc.",2
"I wore Givenchy Photo Perfecxion for years--until they discontinued it. I tried samples of Bobbi Brown,Nars, and the Givenchy replacement for PP and they all were subpar. But this blew me away! it lasts ALL day and has an airbrushed finish.\n\nI have combo skin with large pores and some acne scarring on my jaw. This stuff covers it all--ALL day long.\n\nI use the Becca primer (the purple one) because I found that the primer makes the barepro apply better. Buy barepro lasts just as long without primer. It dries FAST so work in small sections.\n\nI tried setting with my Givenchy setting powder and it was too mattifying. I guess it really is ""self-setting!"" \n\nMy skin has never looked better. Thanks, Givenchy, for making me switch!",2
"I wore this foundation for more than 7 hours, and I didn't turn into an oily mess like I do with other foundations. I'm truly amazed at the formulation. I never thought I could wear a foundation that looks skin-like, with great coverage, and lasts so long.",0
"I would agree with the others that it doesn't give you ""glass skin,"" I didn't even notice a mild sheen once I put my foundation on. However, most primers do nothing for me and my makeup slides right off still. This fills all my pores + fine lines, gives my foundation a smooth base and holds my makeup in place all day.  hands down the best primer I have ever used.",4
"I would give literally zero stars if I could. I do love ABH palettes but this one was a huge disappointment to me. 90% of the shades didn't show up on my skin, except for the few matte ones. I also used different eye primers,  but ended up with the same results.",2
I would give this 5 stars but the little drawers on this get stuck and are very hard to close. The rest of the component is decent and the big drawers glide smoothly! the big drawers only fit 2 large palettes each though and I'm not sure if the back portion is for brushes but it isnt deep enough for my brushes to stand.,4
"I would love to give this product more stars but wasn't able to use long enough to see results. I got TWO USES out of this whole 30mL bottle. TWO. We're talking a pea-sized amount both nights. I'd give it another chance based on the nice texture of the serum itself, but it seems wasteful to order a whole new bottle so I'm a bit hesitant to buy again.",0
"I would love to start with the packaging of this Quad! It is so classy and luxurious! It's the perfect size to take with you and it even comes with a suede like carrying bag. The shadows themselves are amazing in their own right! They swatch silky and soft with great pigment. This quad, in my opinion, is meant for softer eyes looks, and they all blend seamlessly like a dream! They can also be used wet to make more sultry or smokey looks. I was able to create a soft, classy, and sophisticated look using this quad with minimal effort. There was zero fallout. The applicators and brush that come with it, came in handy for on the go touch ups when I went out to dinner and a dance party afterwards! The lightest shade is perfect to highlight your brow bone or pop some on the inner corner to brighten up your eyes. The shimmer is there, but it's not overpowering and doesn't take away from natural beauty features. I am in love with this palette, and will be buying more of them in the future! I did receive this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review, but all of these opinions are my own!",2
"I would prefer to rate this as 3.5 but I am unable to. The price point is truly not bad at all because most facial mask are 55 bucks on up. The packaging is clear which isn't the best for keeping the good ingredients optimum but this isn't uncommon in most cosmetics products. The ingredients in the mask is clean so that's a bonus. This mask reminds me a lot of the clinique overnight moisture surg mask. The texture is whipped and creamy so it does sink into my skin pretty quickly. For some reason I am turned off by the smell. It smells like beer to me. I do experience a slightly tingling effect but it literally only last for 15 to 30 seconds. Overall, I have to say this mask does not work well for me overnight.  I never notice a difference when I am using it overnight.  It's like, I wake up and it feel like I haven't put anything on my face (by the way this with a complete facial regime). As strange as this may sound, I experience the most benefits when I keep this mask on for about 10 to 20 mins and then rinse it off. When I do that, my skin feels smooth and hydrated.  I don't notice much of brightening effect. I mainly use it for hydration.  Overall I probably will not repurchase willingly because I rather explore other mask. The only other overnight mask I have tried was PTR cucumber & rose mask and clinique overnight mask. I have never really noticed a huge difference when using any of these overnight mask. Overall this is a decent mask. I Can't say there's better overnight mask out there because I personally haven't tried many. I just know the mask by fresh (necter vitamin c, Sugar scrub polish and the black tea instant perfection) all have did my skin justice.",4
"I would really love to give this a 5 stars since it's amazing when it comes to taking off makeup. it took off my lash glue easily! however my skin reacted really badly to it. broke me out very badly, I tried using it a couple more times on different occasions but it was the same. last time I used it, it somewhat gave me a boil of some kind. my skin is sensitive, so that could be the reason. \ni still say buy a small size and give it a go since it still is an amazing product... to bad my face hated it x.x I posted photos of what happened, that giant red dot below my eye is the boil type thing ): i normally have good skin but this wasnt having it x.x all the red dots are from that unfortunately....",1
I would say this isnt a worth the estimated $50 value as described because the set is sooo small and tiny. but I do have to say I love the colour and the lipie. I dont think I would have bought it if it wasnt for the sephora discount.,1
"i would say this pallete is huda's most beautiful one! i only take one star off because some matte shades are similar to the new nude ones .The glittery shades a VERY pigmented ! i found that they tend to show more applied with the finger , but be carefull not to press to hard on the pan cause they are very buttery .I read many bad reviews about this palette but i dont see why .",2
"I \xa0love the colors in this palette. The colors are great for an earthy toned look which is just what I want to go for this Fall. The packaging is to die for and got me extremely excited upon opening. I honestly never heard of the brand before this. Only thing I would change is that I wish the glittery shades would stay on better without primer as I\n\xa0use it only in the corners of my eyes but that is kinda the same with any palette I have come across. The price tag is hefty but if you are in the market for premium high end eyeshadows, I would recommend picking one up.",1
"Je m'attendais à des cils spectaculaires avec ce mascara. Je suis franchement déçu. Même après plusieurs couches, l'effet n'est pas saisissant. Toutefois, il reste bien en place au courant de la journée.",2
"jet black but hard to use, I typically only use brush liquid eyeliner but got this complimently to try for free. I do like how it stayed on it's about 7hrs in and no crease. the pen is hard to use, but just getting use to it as it's a felt tip pen",1
JET GIRL is a beautiful beautiful highlighter dont know why such bad reviews or low rating its gorgeous on my deeper skintone very pretty and glowy i dont see glitter like other reviewers have stated its just a nice glow.,2
"Jury is still out. I feel like it's too yellow, the #5 shade is too light, and all of the higher numbers don't offer a red or pink undertone. My husband says it's fine, so it just might be me being paranoid. All of that said, it goes on smoothly and blends easily. I love all of the Laura Mercier products, and plan to continue using them.",3
"Just amazing!!!! Bought this because I'm a huuuge fan of Jessica Rabbit, not because i wanted another highlighter :') But the color is great and i don't have another like that! And for a collector or a fan, this is great! I'll definetly buy the other body highlight too!",0
"Just as good as I expected!  No clumping, no stinging sensitive eyes, great definition & volume.  Please, please make this in Dark Brown (Mocha) for a slightly more natural look for us over 50's and everyone else too!  Way too many ""Coal Matte Blacks"" ... thanks!",4
"Just average.  I love the packaging, but the product doesn't perform better than many less expensive brands.  Not worthy of the price, at all.  I own a large amount of Natasha Denona palettes, and feel that the shadows are superior to these.  (If you're looking for super high end shadows.). I still tend to enjoy ABH palettes the most, so keep that in mind.  I prefer a shadow that is smooth and easy to blend.  If you have similar tastes, I would pass on this palette.",1
"Just finished this jar today. It lasted me a little over a year from every night use. So even though it's a small jar, it does last! Very hydrating and instantly absorbs into skin but didn't really brighten my dark circles that much. 3.5/5",1
"Just like other Hourglass powders, these powders are so flattering! Any time I use this I get compliments on my skin. I also have oily skin and these don’t seem to make it more obvious. The packaging is pretty cheap looking, so hopefully the company sees all of these reviews and leaves the packaging as limited edition. I highly suggest this palette because of how flattering it is!",0
"Just like the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream, this eye cream sits beautifully under make up. I don't generally use eye cream, I just use my moisturizer under my eyes, but this cream changed my mind.  It sticks were you put it and my concealer went on beautifully. I have such badly with concealer that my criteria for a good one is that it just doesn't look terrible. This cream made my concealer look better than ever. Now it's my new magic potion for perfect concealer application!",3
"Just no...used this for a few days with no problems but after day 4 it started to burn my under eye area. For the price point I wasnt looking for a miracle, just wanted something to last till I could afford my normal product, but wasnt expecting the burning. Never had this problem with any other eye cream.",1
"Just ordered two based upon the fact that having two 1 oz bottles of SKII is almost equivalent to purchasing the smallest bottle they offer, which is almost $100. Want to try the Sheisedo serum as well. I've tried a few of the other products and like them, but can also put them aside as stocking stuffers if I choose. This is an amazing value.",4
"Just received my first ever CT lipstick by post today and, Charlotte, I'm impressed.  Red Hot Susan is a stunning matte - deep red with rust undertones and will be wonderful to wear now into Autumn 2019.  Easily applied with that wonderful bevelled bullet shape and creamy consistency.  I love the very slight vanilla scent.  Packaging is tres elegant, the slide-out box matches the unique pattern on the case, hefty quality and does not disappoint.  My search to cut back on my pricey Tom Ford lipsticks is finally successful!  Love it, and highly recommend!",3
Just received this in the mail and immediately had to try it out. I'm truly amazed with this mascara and the results that I got. The brush holds the perfect amount of product and the volume and separation it gives your lashes is impressive.   If I could get a bit more length from this mascara it would be a holy grail product but it still gets five stars. I received this product complementary.,2
"Just recieved it in the mail, swatched it on my hand (2 layers, since the first layer was watery and not pigmented) and let it dry. after it dried down to a matte finish I lightly ran my finger across it and it crumbled! I've never had an eyeliner do that! I tried a second swatch on my hand, this time just one layer and shook the bottle, after I let it dry I ran my finger across it and it smeared as if it never dried down! I love Melt, but this was a huge huuuge dissapointment",1
"Just splendid. The texture is nice and silky which makes it easy to absorb. I instantly feel the softness and smoothness of my eyes after using it. I don't experience puffiness or irritation like a lot of other eye creams have done to me in the past. After a few days of use, my eyeballs feel firm and supple. Just delightful. I also did not experience rusting on the applicator tip as others have mentioned however I do wipe it after every use just in case. A little goes a long way. Have already repurchased twice and ordered it for my mom to enjoy! Highly recommend!",0
"Just started using this product and it did wonders to my very dry skin. It has always been a struggle finding a good moisturizer. Will definitely keep using this. Prior to this I was using Shiseido Bioperformance Revitalizing Cream and it does work as well. However, this Waso seems to be a cheaper alternative to the former.",4
"Just the tiniest bit, a grain of rice, patted on undereye circles helps immensely.  I then pat my eyelids close to the lashline which always seems to be a bit red.  Repeat patting from outer eye to inner eye, lower, then upper. It's not strong like concealer, or a cure. It's worth it to me to have the improvement offered.",4
"Just the toner I was looking for.  I've tried a few other exfoliating toners, but this one is by far the best for my skin.   The Ordinary was a little too harsh, so there must have been an ingredient in it that didn't agree with me.  I use this nightly and pretty much there is no more roughness in my skin.  Pricey for a toner, but worth it.",3
"Just to be clear, I did receive this in an Influenster box that cost nothing to me. Firstly, this isn’t a concealer that will cover your dark circles, it honestly doesn’t cover much. Like the name of the product says, it’s very brightening, but it’s brightening that it will just highlight the skin around your eyes, not conceal. To get this product to concealer you will have to apply a decent amount of this. And btw, you have to turn the mechanism on this for what seems like forever.",0
"just to show you there is no crazy pink pigment in shade hint hint... overall I am obsessed, it doesn't form any white cakey film on the lips (like cheaper brands) I love the staying power of this product and the feel of softness it gives upon application",4
"Just tried a sample I received with an order and not expecting to like it, but gave it a try and I actually like the taste. It already has stevia in it so I just put a little Almond milk into it and drank it. It is relaxing.  I don't taste mushrooms at all. Will be ordering when back in stock. As for tasting like dirt, I can not attest to that since I have never eaten dirt-so I can only say this tastes good to me, but not like regular cocoa. It is an acquired taste. Minus 1 star for the small amount of cocoa a packet makes. Less than 1/2 cup.",3
Just what I've been looking for. This lipstick is creamy but stays in place. I applied the lipstick around 10 a.m. and had a bottle of water to drink. There wasn't any lipstick residue on the bottle. I did a kiss test on my husband's cheek and there was no transfer of color. around 2 p.m. I had lunch and when I checked on my lipstick afterward it was still there however it could have used a slight touch-up. My lips never looked dry and the color did not seep in to any lines. I am very pleased with this lipstick and will probably purchase additional colors.,2
just wow!! I will be 48 in November so needless to say I am doing everything to fight the signs of aging. I love how beautifully this glides over the skin. I use this both morning and evening and find no stickiness whatsoever so perfect for under make up. I have been using it at least a week and am starting to notice a difference in my skin elasticity and brightness. I can't wait to see what my skin will look like on 30 days. Its defintely pricey but not alot is needed so it will last a while. I did reveice this from Influenster but the review is my honest thoughts. This may definitely be a repurchase during a sale to help with the cost.,3
"Just wow.....this blush is special.  It's like blush and highlighter combined so it does give a starburst effect to the cheekbones.  It's very pigmented and needs a lighter hand unless you are going for the golden goddess look.  It smells like Peach but doesn't smell exactly like the liquid foundation which I love.  Overall, this is a truly unique shade.",1
"Keep in mind I've only been using this for one week so I haven't given it the 3-4 week mark yet, but the difference in a cheaper product I used before and this is so disappointing I figured I'd review this.  It does a great job moisturizing and priming your under eye area. Aside from that, I have zero results after a week of using this. I've always noticed SOME sort of improvement after a week of applying a new cream twice a day, so I'm a little frustrated. My under eye area actually seems to have gotten worse than it has in years...I realize how much my old cream reduced my puffiness because I have such puffy eyebags now and i do not see any noticable difference in my dark circles. Big disappointment considering the price. Maybe the ingredients just don't mesh well with my composition? Definitely returning...",4
"Kevyn Aucoin’s The Volume Mascara has been my favorite go-to for several years now. Each tube lasts me around 3 months. The mascara’s wand has short bristles and this makes the wand extra easy for me to work with. The mascara itself is nice and dark plus it tubes! I love how easy it is to remove at night. Just wet your lashes with warm water using  your fingers or a washcloth, wait several seconds for the tubes to loosen, then gently pull the tubes off!  The mascara is long wearing, won’t transfer or create raccoon eyes. The only two things that slightly annoy me are that I often end up with black specks on my eyelid while applying the mascara. I know this is user error. The other thing that slightly annoys me is that if you apply too much, your lashes may clump and the tubing makes it difficult to brush the lashes with a spoolie. Overall though, I really enjoy using this mascara.",2
"Kush is a great lip color. Goes on smoothly, has a hint of minty freshness, and wears off nicely. It's my new daily color, and I've tried too many to count! And fun bonus, the magnetic lid means it won't ever leak in my packed purse!",1
"LADIES and GENTS this product is the one tho!!! I’ve been using nightly for over a month and let me tell you, the results are amazing! Honestly, after using it for two days I was amazed. I use it nightly, it go on like butter but like in serum form, is actually refreshing and doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight or sticky. I think it’s amazing on its own but I really saw crazy results when I used it in conjunction with my micro blade dermal roller! If you have hyperpigmentation or scaring you NEED this product!!! I’m still I in disbelief at how much this has faded my hyperpigmentation that I’ve battled with for almost two years. I received this as a free trail through Influenster but I will absolutely purchase this when my trial bottle is gone! Seriously, stop reading this and order... go now!!!",1
"LaNeige is a really good Korean cosmetic brand. Their product range at Sephora is not wide, but what they do have at Sephora is top-notch. (Note to Sephora:  Please carry LaNeige SPF50 sunblock lotion!). Back to this review...  This cushion foundation is perfect. It has a light finish but blends on with its “sponge-puff” applicator beautifully. It gives a “your-skin-but-better” natural appearance with a lovely radiant glow and good staying power. The compact is sturdy but sleek, and a refill is provided in the package. Love this product!",4
"Lashes are not bad, been using them a lot lately., however not with the glue because it's the worst glue I've ever tried. I don't understand why so many people like the glue. It doesn't stick at all. Got this for free from Influenster.",1
"Left it on for 30 minutes. Package directions indicate rubber mask provides a cooling sensation. Try frostbite! 24 hours later and my face is still red across nose and cheeks and very tender. Serum didn't soak into my skin  under the mask, just sat on top. Had to pat for a long time to get it to soak in. The serum did reduce the look of pores. So there was that benefit. But for me the cons far outweighed the pros.",3
"Let me be honest. I never really used a cleanser much. I rarely wear makeup so the most I did was use some Witch hazel toner to wipe away the day. I always thought cleansers would strip my skin of natural oils and dry me out. I have naturally dry skin, and if I dont moisturize it gets oily because its actually dry, so I was nervous about using this. But I got this in one of Farmacy's value sets that I bought for the Honeymoon Glow. I've used it for over a month now, and I love it. It's not at all drying and it smells nice, not overly perfumed but natural. I now like to wash my face.",1
"let me just get the negative out of the way: the balm is AWFUL! it without even exaggerating smells like something died inside of the tube. Ignoring the smell, the balm is almost impossible to apply because when you go to press it against your lips it crumbles and falls out of the tube. \nwhy did I still rate this 4 stars? despite the balm being so awful, the other two products are absolute perfection! and it is a great way to try the products for a lower price before committing to the larger size with the larger price tag",0
"let me just start of by saying I have only used this product for 1 day, so I'm not sure how this product works in the long run, but OHHHHHHH MYYYYY GOOOOOD. this has been one of the best moisturizers ever. put it on before you sleep and it literally TRANSFORMS your skin. I have very dry, patchy, and acne prone skin. I even have this little rosacea patch on my left cheek and when I woke up this morning the redness is going away!!! my skin feels overall texture wise so even! I really reccomend this as a quick fix to anyone who has some very troubled skin. like seriously my skin is sooo happy !!!",4
Let me start by saying how much I love this product. It makes my face feel refreshed and hydrated at the same time.  The bottle packaging is super cute and is a nice size.  I can get fully recommend this product to a friend or family member.,0
"Let me start by saying I’m not an influencer, I purchased this myself. I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and if you have acne prone skin this is amazing. I find out very fast if something is going to make me breakout. Within a week. But I still waited to make this review just to be sure. It’s moisturizing, smells like orange sorbet. In my opinion, I like the smell of ginzing from origins better but this smell is lighter and disappears quickly. Most importantly, I have not had a single break out from this product. My skin is temperamental even at 29, most moisturizers clog my pores. As someone in their late twenties, don’t expect a miracle from any cream if you have wrinkles. This will temporarily plump them up a little bit! But if your main concern is needing some moisture without clogging your pores, this cream is it!",0
"Let me start by saying I've tried Dior foundations in the past, and I wasn't entirely impressed. This one, however, surprised me.\n\nIt leaves a soft matte finish, and it blended very nicely. It goes on medium coverage and I did have to work a bit to get it to go to full coverage, but once I did it was beautiful and lasted all day. I have combo skin so I'm used to my foundations breaking up, but not this one. I got all day wear. The only downside I noticed was it did oxidized about a half shade darker on me, and it was noticeable. I tried multiple primers and every time it still oxidized. I added a small touch of white pigment to it and that helped with the color but I was a little disappointed. Beyond that, I loved it!\n\nI received this product complimentary for reviewing purposes. I was not compensated in any way for my review.",4
Let me start by saying this stuff is amazing. I stopped into Sephora because I had started using a retinol cream that burned my skin and was dry after I used to much so the sales lady suggested I tried the biossance.  This stuff is thick and rich and I was worried I was going to wake up with broken out skin but I haven't and my skin after one day looked amazing. I was able to wear it under my foundation and still looked great. I can't wait to try the whole line. I can't say enough about this cream I have super dry skin. Love this cream.,3
"Let me start off by saying, SHAKE IT UP! You gotta shake it up for like ten seconds before spraying because it really does have clay in it! This is absolutely wonderful for over makeup unlike their dewy mist (which acts more like a serum and can separate foundation).  This really helps with oily skin and help fix makeup, especially since it's getting hot again outside.  It's even good if you get a little sweaty outside as it gets hotter and you use this to soak it up.  It doesn't have really any scent to it so it's friendly for sensitive skins.  It has just a touch of rehydrating, the perfect amount to soak up Oiliness without stripping your skin of it's natural nutrients. I really love the packaging, I love that it's glass and it's got good weight to it.  I bought this as soon as it came out and I haven't seen any problems with the spray nozzle so far.  I still get a good even mist.  If you can afford this, I would absolutely get this over other makeup sprays or anti-oiliness sprays. I would also get this instead of the dewy skin mist if you have oily skin. It's really great and gentle on this skin, it is good if you have acne, and it's clean by Sephora which is always a plus.  I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out.",0
"Let me start off by saying that I don’t write reviews however, I am so in love with this product—it definitely warrants one. It’s so versatile, you get sheer coverage which can build up to a light to medium coverage with a blurring effect, which is right up my alley. Literally lasts all day, does not give off a cakey appearance, doesn’t settle into my laugh lines and it has physical sunblock in it. For a natural finish, I literally just apply with my fingers. The color works for my complexion which is a rich, tan, olive complexion, MAC NW45 for reference. Many companies mistakenly formulate more deeper tan complexions with a red undertone, which I don’t have —so it becomes a challenge for myself to find a perfect shade. I literally end up being in between two shades with many other companies. I remember the formulation of Bosia’s previous BB cream, which I wanted to like but couldn’t due to the limited shade range. I must say, well done Bosica, please do NOT discontinue this product. ❤️",1
"Let me start off saying that I have not had much experience with the bottom row, my job at a law firm does not give me much of an opportunity to wear color eyeshadows, so this review is mainly about the top two rows. Despite having a large eyeshadow palette collection I find myself reaching for this palette multiple times a week. I find that the mattes blend beautifully and the transition shades in this palette are game changers. I've used every color on the top two rows and they are all amazing. My favorite has to be Limoncello because it is the perfect inner corner highlight. Even when I use other palettes I have to dip into Limoncello for that inner corner pop. It is my understanding that the bottom row does not perform the best, but if you are looking for some good mattes with beautiful simmer shades in Limoncello and Gusti, I'd definitely pick this palette.",0
"Let me start out by saying that I love everything Hourglass! Unfortunately this palette,  for the price,  was okay at best. The pans are small, which I expected from previously purchased palettes. IDK there just wasn't much special about this that would justify 80 bucks.",2
"Life changing. I’ve had eczema for years, only in winter, and only on my hands. Thus year, however, it completely ravaged my face. Cortisone didn’t touch it, nor did any of the dozens of other otc or prescription options I tried. This oil combined with the steep cream, have given me back my smooth,  clear skin I am so in love, and I can’t believe the difference.",3
"lightweight hydrating mist that gives a nice glow. I'm not really sure if I can reap any other benefits other than it makes my skin feel supple and make it look glowy. it doesnt have a harsh smell and smells pleasant. Not too sure if blue light is a big issue but it doesnt make my skin feel hydrated and soft! great ontop of makeup to refresh it and take away a powdery look, not quite a setting spray but more of a finishing spray to get a nice base.",0
"Lightweight, natural coverage that lasts. Worked great for me. I was in the hot sun for a good portion of the day and this did the trick for me. Love Supergoop products. They work beautifully, with no white cast.",4
"Like all of the UD palettes, the staying power is good and the colours pop. I wish that they had a ""petite"" version of this though for when I travel. I would not use these shades every day and so can't justify packing it for ""occasional"" use",3
"Like all the other reviews, I can agree - the burgundy side is dried out. I got one wing (of streakiness) in and then shook it like crazy....nothing. Brown and black work well and apply smoothly. The pencil sides are meh...small amount of product, a little chalky and not a smooth application. They also break very easily at the slightest of pressure. I love tarte liners, I have many of the gel liner pots and other tarteist liners...not sure what happened here.",1
"Like most review said, the packaging aka the opening hole sucked.  That, and the price is a little high for the amount of product, but you really only are meant to use this once or twice a week.  It peeled off nicely, and my skin felt incredibly refreshed/cleansed especially my T-zone.  Also, it didn't make my skin feel tight even though my cheek area tends to get dry.  Over all, it's a very pleasant experience with my first peel-off mask.",0
"Like others, I am very disappointed by how easily the brush head falls off. Sephora was kind enough to replace the first one I purchased, where the head came off literally the day, and now the replacement brush has the same issue. DO NOT BUY.",2
"Like others on here, I was skeptical, but I was also intrigued by this product. I have used one patch one time and have already seen a difference in the horizontal frown line on the bridge of my nose. You definitely know the microneedles are there, but the patch is not painful to apply or wear. I wore mine overnight and woke to noticeably improved skin. If you are on the fence, like I was, go ahead and try this product. You're going to be impressed.",3
"Listen. These cost $15 for a 60 count supply. Are they the best chemical peel pad on the market? Of course not. Are they comparable to the $88 product that you've used and loved? Probably not.\nHOWEVER\nAre they sufficient daily exfoliation? ABSOLUTELY.\nIf your looking to replace your Dr. Gross peel pads, you're not going to do it with this $15 product. But if you want something you can use daily and stretch out your more expensive products, this is a great choice.",2
literally magic. It does wonder for your skin. It is one of the worst smelling product ever but it's sulfur. Best way to use this product is to rub deep into skin or dap your problem area with this toner. I use SK-ii and this and it has cured my acne,0
"Literally saving money from going to a spa. I honestly think this is an amazing product.  I am 34, and I have light hyper pigmentation , uneven texture, and my skin is starting to set into maturity. This product has helped immensely. I use this once a week, and I noticed after a month my skin has looked more even and youthful. I have been using the same skin regime so I know definately this product has certainly gave it the kick it needed.",1
Living in Florida I always carry a mist with me due to humid and hot climates! I find this mist very handy and it's not glass and hence travel friendly . I use it everyday during my working hours to rejuvenate my skin and also up lift my mood. it is quite moisturizing and calming. This unlike other few mists could be used by both dry and oily skin type people !,1
"Long-time NARS fan, loved the idea of oil-infused lip tint, and they sure hit it out of the park with this one! Feels wonderful, lasts very long, and I know it's doing good work on my lips all at the same time. I chose Disco Infernal only after trying it on--color in the tube looked too CRAZY for anytime except partying, and yet when applied it is a PERFECT color. Don't miss any of these new NARS lip tints....SO.DARNED.GOOD!",3
"Looks amazingly gorgeous, attracts light and shines beautifully, does not budge once dry and adds a pop even when the look is already glittery or has some form of shine. This is just next level shine. Only downside is, it seems to always be patchy yet I can never add enough to cover it? As if the light hitting it makes it look like it's inconsistent. Mind you it only shows with my 10x mirror so it might just be a trick of the light.",0
"Looks pretty from a distance, but it sat in my pores and highlighted any texture on my skin. The lightest color was slightly too dark and too yellow for me (for reference, my skin is darker than MUFE Y205 but lighter than Lancome 090) and oxidized visibly over the first five minutes I wore it.",1
Look this product probably works amazing for some people but it almost instantly irritated my skin when they had it in store for trial to show it to people. My hands were still itchy almost an hour later after using rubbing alcohol to get it off.  The lady told me it was a dry oil and it's good for moisturizing your skin all day - and I totally believe it does that.  All I would say is if you know you have sensitive skin see if there's a way to try it first to see if it works for you but if you don't have sensitive skin I think there's a good chance you'll be very happy with it. My hands might be crazy itchy right now but they're certainly hydrated.,4
"Looooved the color of this pigment, it's soooo saturated and has an amazing electric blue, metallic tone. I used a wet brush and had some issues applying it but I think it was because I didn't let the first coat dry first.",0
"LOVE! Allow me to provide you some background info on my skin: combination, acne-prone, hyperpigmentation, some texture (due to acne). I've never been one to use toners. The mention of toners elicits unhappy memories of alcohol, astringent based formulas. This toner changed my mind! It refreshes your skin by gently taking off oil excess and gently cleanses your skin (great for black/white heads on my forehead). I've seen a difference on the absorption of other skin products such as moisturizer, serums, acne topical medications AND makeup. It does not dry out your skin!\n\nTips on how to apply: After cleansing, apply drops of toner onto a cotton pad and gently buff into your skin (AM/PM). Follow with serums, moisturizer, SPF, etc.",0
"Love at first application. It's a substantial cream. I first used it as a mask as suggested and my skin felt plump, hydrated and healthy after I removed it. A few days later, I used it as an overnight mask and woke up to super soft and moist skin. I was feeling really good about my skin that day and only used concealer in a few places. Definitely a keeper and a new edition to my skin care routine.",3
"Love at first use!! This loves my skin!! I use this every Night and it has worked wonders! It gives my skin a glow and I can definitely tell when I've ""forgot or used"" another product. I continue to go back to this every time!!",3
"Love Barerminerals Foundation. Been wearing the Original for about 14 yrs. Amazing, but I do miss pressed powder foundation. This one is pretty good. I have combination skin so problems with both oily and dry areas and this covers well. Amazingly I picked the right shade first shot. Recently tried Porcelain but coverage nowhere near as good. Do the shades differ there?  I wouldn't describe Sateen as full coverage, but it is close. Will use this one as long as they make it. Five plus stars for Original, this is more like 4.5.",2
"Loved at first, tasted great, but then started noticing that a few minutes after finishing one, it would give me the jitters. As if I had drank a cup of strong coffee. I'll stick with it plain from another brand. These are super convenient though...sigh....",2
LOVED! I have extremely dry skin and I’ve been trying to find a skincare routine for a long time now and I’m so happy to have found farsali! It has helped my dry skin so much! I was always curious about these products from seeing them on IG but couldn’t afford to buy the 30ml size. So when they came out with the skin goals it was perfect for me to try and LOVE! Everyone is complaining about the size but it’s perfect to sample . I tried these and re ordered all of them! Perfect timing because I got the holiday deals! Def hooked! Now I am dying to try hydration bae and the lip mask!,0
"Loved the feeling, broke me out! I was so excited to use it on a trip and a day or two after using it, I noticed I was breaking out from it. everything else that I've used stayed the same except that. I had to give it away and I was so excited to try it out!",0
LOVED the shade match and coverage but I ended up with extremely bad acne all across my jaw and cheeks. A friend mentioned the same thing happened to her while using FENTY so I stopped using this and my skin cleared up right away. Watch out - this could cause some major breakouts.,0
"Loved this formula and shade. Well pigmented and blends well. I feel it has more of a matte finish. I love this product the way it is. Packaging is professional as well. Formula is buildable, but remember a little goes a long way! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0
"Loved this product the first time I tried it. I got a sample that lasted a few days and was hooked.\n\nI like the way it glides on the skin, loved the coverage, and the way it feels when it is dry. And in the morning my skin is glowingly hydrated!",3
Loved this set. Very moisturizing with a hint of color. My lips have been painfully dry this winter too so I was eager to try these. I wear the lip treatment under my lipstick and it holds the color for a while.,3
loved using this product it went on creamy and dried very quickly. I did use this with my too faced primer and also with bobbi brown primer. It last throughout the day with little touch up and still could build the coverage up on it. I loved how this product also didn't agitate my skin ar all. I recieved this product as a sample for review on Influester. But i also became a fan.,2
LOVE every single Laneige product - they kill it every time. I love the fact that this is a dual product - toner and moisturizer. I was skeptic all but it works so well. It’s not oily at all and makes my skin feel and look great. I’ve noticed a different in the size of my pores and overall look of my skin in less than a week. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I will be purchasing this product once my sample runs out.,0
"Love everything about this product. The sleek jar took me a minute to figure out. After a duh moment of trying to unscrew the inner lid, I realized you just push down and a perfect amount of this silky cream comes out. It's a combination of retinol and vitamin C and no air gets to it this way! The citrus fragrance is so delightful..I almost want to eat it.  I have been using this for about 10 days. I am already a retin A user so I alternate between that and this moisturizer every other night and my face is glowing!  I did receive this product free for my honest review. Kate Somerville Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer is a winner. I will buy this stuff!",3
"Love everything in this kit! My 49 year old combination,sun damaged skin has had amazing results from the products in this kit,so much so that I ordered 2 more  kits vib sale in April.Have recently switched skincare brands to Algenist,was using Lancome and I couldnt be happier,I made the change to Algenist, because I seen rests after 3 days use.I get about a month use from the moisturizers and eye balm,2 and half weeks with cleanser and the face mist will get months of use,as 1 spray is all I need! excellent products for reasonable price,and actually getting positive results! Algenist has transformed my skin,thank you",3
"Love how unique this lip balm is... that's why I bought it as I have nothing like it. Very luxurious packaging, the balm has a nice vanilla scent. Moisturizing and long lasting. Not sticky. Goes on clear and has a slight shine to it. It could have a slight tint your your lips if you apply more than one application. Very expensive for how much you get but it's a nice splurge on something a little different.",2
"Love how velvity this product is. I use it every day as a primer/hydrator by itself, ir with my casual use with powder foundation but do not recommend using it with liquid foundations. It does not feel really sticky and gross, or flakey like other primers I have tried.",4
Love!!! i have dry under eyes and this is so light- can be built up and does not have to be set.  i liked it so much i drove 30 min to pick up the last 3 at the store because they were sold out online and the sale price along with Rouge sale was $11.  can't beat it!,2
"Love . I'm med.skintone with a yellow undertone.  What I liked the most was that it didn't dry my lips and it did stay put. I love the rosewood color and thought at first that it might be too dark. What I realized is I didn't wear as much makeup.  I know, weird but true. I wore this color,  foundation, a brown eye liner , and mascara.  Done !! Easy to use as a liner and then color in. I did use a lip balm on top a few times but it made the color look even darker so I opted not to do that. My new always lip color.",4
"Love! I never buy new makeup brushes in sets and as soon as I touched these I had to have them. The concealer brush applies my concealer under my eye like a freaking dream. Every brush is great, I use at least 3 or 4 of the 5 daily. I hope they make more!",4
"Love it!!! first I exfoliated my lips, then I applied a semi thick layer to my lips at night and it didn't budge at all and it was soooo moisturizing. My lips felt amazingly smooth the following morning.",1
"Love it, great texture and love the way it hydrates without being oily. Makes my skin soft and smooth. Almost feels like a thicker primer. I have only used at night for this reason not sure if I would use it under makeup. Starts solid and once you run your finger in it becomes liquid.",0
"love it! Quick and easy to use. At first I thought this would be messy and leave my skin with some sort of unpleasant scent, but I was completely wrong. After using this product my skin feels so soft and looks snatched!",4
Love. I usually use the Laneign for my lip mask and my Sephora girls from downtown Disney Anaheim recommended this new TATCHA lip mask. I love it so much more than the Laneign because it’s a gel type of lip mask the other ones then to have a look of chapstick. Where this one is a gel. It comes with the signature spoon. A little goes a long way. Highly recommend.,0
"Love KVD brushes!  This Lock-It Edge Foundation Brush smooths my liquid foundation nice and evenly, around the nose and into pores. Unlike sponges this brush applies foundation without waste. I do gently pat my face afterward to eliminate any brush strokes.",4
love love love. I cant say enough about this amazing little product. It is lifechanging let me start there. For personal use or in your kit this must be a staple in your makeup routine. 1 dewy balm side to create a dewy glow 1 highlight color of your choice. I started with nude I now have all of them they are so stunning and create that gorgeous pat skin finish. OBSESSED!,4
"Love, love, love!  It's the kind of lippie that you can swipe on without a mirror (I bought 260 Mirage) and ads a sparkle and shine to your natural lips plus a little OOMPH.  Staying power?  Not so much.  2 hours tops.  Very hydrating.  I confess I went back for more!",3
Love love love the colors although for aome reason her browns are more purplish. .  just like in the nude palette.  glitter is NOT chunky in the slightest.  people aay it is but clearly they are hating on Huda.  the glitter in nude palette was way chunkier,3
"Love love love this foundation...I have tried them all, from cheap brands to the most expensive and this foundation is hands down the best. Perfect texture and coverage! Makes my skin look like silk and flawless.. it’s so amazing that I will never try another foundation again. You must try this and you will not be disappointed!",3
"Love love love this palette. Actually I love every single Huda palette including the minis. I have all of them, and they are my everyday use pallettes. I know this particular palette is mad expensive, but trust me it is so worth it, and it's so pigmented that it'll last you forever! Worth the $$$ ladies!!!",2
LOVE LOVE LOVE this palette! the colors are beautiful and very pigmented. I can utilize it for everyday use or for a night out. only bummer is they do not include a brush like they do with their other naked palettes.,2
"Love, love, love this product!  I use it as a foundation.  I am 58 years old and it does not wind up in the creases of my wrinkles.  Wonderful!  Goes on smoothly.  Provides sunscreen and a bit of color.   I wear it to work and it lasts all day.",3
"Love, love these colors! The price is great too, my only complaint is the top lid broke off, so that could be made more sturdy or reinforced better. Nothing like a great makeup product to have bad packing. Other than that I use this each and every day.",1
"Lovely colors and packaging, but the glitters are very hard to work with. Lots of fallout, and no matter what I tried (primer, no primer, applying on bare skin) I could not get them to stay on my eyelids. The mattes are nice, the shimmers are just OK. Overall, there are better palettes out there for the price.",0
Lovely mask.  This mask is a magical one who is looking for brighter skin.  I wanted to try it out since the reviews were great.  It didn't disappoint me.  I used it on the day of my brother's wedding and people were complimenting my skin.,1
Lovely way to try these products before purchasing a full size. There is enough in each to give you a feel for how you will like them. I have been using them for over two weeks now and have plenty left.,1
"Love Milk lip + cheek color.  Werk is the most beautiful shade of dusty rose. I can wear this for a natural daytime look or for a more full makeup look. The finish is amazing. It is dewy without being shiny. I never used a cream blush before and was nervous if this would be hard to apply or streaky.  This formula is so easy to use, blends and layers well with both powder and cream makeup.",4
"Love minis to test products before commiting to fill size. A little goes a long way with this, less is more, you can always add as needed. I dot lightly on face and blend with foundation brush. Has a dewy moist finish, but does look like natural skin. Wish I could also buy a mini size of the matte to test since I have oily skin. Will feel heavy, greasy and will crease if you apply too much.",1
"LOVE! MUE did a fantastic job I have my hair pieces to my niece who adored them, the cloth is awesome I dig the print and it works fantastic! absolutely wash it before using because some mascaras and stuff will stain it and it'll be really hard to get those stains out BUT serious 5/5 I won't be returning to makeup remover wipes ever",1
"Love Original/Ltd Ed formula Meh no applicator for full size jar? I use the pink formula as my sleeping masque and wear it every night, I bought it in January and I am only now getting near the end of the jar. I purchased the set so my sister could try the sweet candy version, she is new to lip masques and my favorite sugar scrub. I figured I would put the other mini in my purse for super cold weather (snowing our area today). I knocked off one star because the mint chocolate chip formula is thin in consistency and nothing like my full size, and I did not receive and applicator for my full size jar. I did not expect applicators for the minis, but I did for the full size jar. I mean, think about that... it lasts a year, that's a year of putting your fingers in the jar, so I knocked a second star off for that. This should be a five star product, so I'm not sure why the formula is so thin on the one mini, and the other is jus going to my sister to try, and it would not be cool for me to test it and give it to her, so I'll let her put some on a clean toothpick or something for me. Maybe next year Laneige will be more thoughtful about the applicator, and use the regular formula for minis when they put out holiday flavors.",3
"Love the benefits of this collagen - younger looking skin, for one! The taste requires a little disguising: I drop one tablet into an eight ounce bottle of orange juice and let it dissolve in the fridge, then shake and drink. The juice is strong enough to cover the ""rose and lemon"" (?!) flavor of these tablets, and the method ensures a smooth mixture.The tablets are a premeasured, easy way to travel with collagen. I have taken this for several months now and prefer the marine collagen effects to those of bovine origin.",3
Love the color and the sparkle! I don’t understand the reviews that say it’s gritty! I feel that too many people are “ would be influencers” and don’t actually buy the products and they give improper reviews!  I bought it! I like it! I will Buy the full size! It’s an expensive and quality product ..this is a try me size and I am okay with that! My only criticism is that I wish it lasted longer.,3
"Love the color scheme and the variety of matte, shimmer, foil, and glitter shades. I really like how the palette is organized by the colors that go together. Good size pans/amount of product for the price too! Great quality shadows that blend very easily. I will definitely be sad if this palette gets discontinued.",1
love the colour but I do have 3 issues with it\n1: not a lot of product for the price \n2: if I have foundation on and put the colour on directly from the stick it will pull the foundation off \n3: dont like that I have to warm it up in order for it to work properly  (otherwise it is very dry),0
"Love the compact size and the magnitized pans make it nice to swap out colours from my other Theory palettes, making it great to travel with. The case is made out of sturdy cardboard, similar in feel, magnetic closing and material as the Pat Macgrath Labs eyeshadow palettes. The shadows are pigmented, yet easy to blend. The mattes aren't chalky and the shimmers are fine and smooth. They don't need a primer, but colours (esp the shimmers) do get a boost with them.",1
"Love the concealer,  covers well my undereye dark circles on one sweep. Didn't use it on blemishes becaise I didn't breakout during the time I  tried it. At first rhe color seemed too yellow but on my skin it helped cover the dark circles amazingly I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
Love the finish on this foundation! Easy to blend in but I did find that it went a little pink on my skin for a neutral undertone. But that aside it wears very good for the entire day. I was sent this product by Influenster to review and test out.,4
"Love the formula, love how it wears. It still looked great 9 hours after application. It's sheer, yes, but that's why it looked so natural. Next time, I'm going to buy the Terra Nueva shade, but honestly, both it and the Finland look good.",3
love the glow that this product gives.  I wear the product alone as well with foundation and am pleased with both outcomes. I recommend this product as it's not overwhelming while giving you the glow you need.,2
"Love the light weight longevity of this foundation. I have extremely oily skin and am very pleased. BE ADVISED: I had to return,  but repurchased because there was a crack in the tip of the bottle resulting in waste of the product.",3
Love the lipsticks as they are my all time fave but the price did seem a lot high. Whatever I will keep them because they are my 3 fave colors and will last a long time. Gosh damn it I love this lip stick so much but feel ripped off at the same time. Thanks Sephora/Armani!,1
Love the list of ingredients with the exception of the Carrageenan from Edible Seaweed. Carrageenan is known to cause digestive issues and isn't completely broken down by the body. I'm looking for a healthier option for my glow.,1
Love them all!!! A must buy!! Love Fresh!! Have only tried clay masks before but after trying this set I am in love! Always loved fresh products! The youth mositurizers are a staple!! My skin never looked so good!,1
Love the mascara!  Doesn’t clump and easy to remove. The gloss gives a nice subtle color to my lips and is very moisturizing.  However I’m not sure how long it will last due to the product being more slender.  I’ve previously used the Dior lip balm which is also expensive but lasts forever so not sure if I’d repurchase the balm.,3
"love the packaging and the flower is a nice touch, I see this has been given some not great reviews, but I  personally love this! It dose just what it is supposed to do. it's not sticky or tacky so that's a plus in my books, it goes on smooth and hydrates",2
Love the packaging and the value of the product but overall wasn't very comfortable to sleep on. I took the pillow with me on a camping trip. The pillow is small so it ends up sliding down around. It's hard to sleep on since there's not much surface area. I woke up with a crick in my neck since the pillow kept sliding down from my head.,0
Love the pigments in this palette! The colors are so vibrant and can be seen over my tattoos when swatching. The showed up nice and bright on my eyes. The formula is nice and creamy. Great for a date night or party look!,0
"love the scent, love the formula, but there is a huge flaw in the packaging... the rollerball gets stuck and the product doesn't come out. I started leaving it in my car during the summer to get the product to flow out easier, that works but it also started turning the formula a bit hazy. I know inc.redible can do better because I have two of the roller bottles with the crystals in them and those never get stuck (but those are missing the yummy scent that comes in this one.) If I were going to recommend one to you, I'd recommend the ones with the crystals, honestly, because although this formula is yummier you just can't get it out of the tube.",1
Love these eye masks. I have tried a lot and these do reduce puffiness and the packaging is cute. They do not slip. My boyfriend got me some for Christmas but I had to pick up more on this amazing deal. Like pretty much getting six for FREE!,1
Love these glosses. If you are looking for a hydrating sheer wash of color without the stickiness then these are great. Easy to keep in your purse and apply whenever you want a little something more than bare skin.,4
"Love the Stila line, but this liquid shadow in a tube is very tricky to apply. The lighter - highlight - shades are forgiving, but the two dark shades are a bit lumpy-sticky-streaky. I dot the dark colour across my lid and try to blend but that doesn't work, either does dragging the swab. I end up trying to apply a light coat and then putting powder shadow on top.\n\nAlthough I'm having application issues, the colours are slightly sparkly and gorgeous.",3
Love the volume this mascara delivers! It helps lengthen and volumize my lashes. It definitely adds drama to your lashes and overall look. \nUsing this along with the primer also meant no raccoon eye after take it off!,0
"Love this! Absorbs almost as soon as it touches your skin. really does grip the foundation but as someone with oily skin and acne concerns, it really is lightweight and you cannot tell you even have anything on aside from the mattifying effect it gives. 10/10 recommend.",4
Love this and have tried many that cannot match this. When I don't wear waterproof mascaras I can just use this to clean everything off my face. That makes this super great so I can concentrate on treatments and moisturizers more quickly. Literally I found this years ago. Luckily for me it works!,3
"love this and oil. I tried a few diff ones and this beat them (if herbivore contained more cbd it might be a close call due to the price) this stuff absorbs well, evens out my irritated acne prone complexion, helped clear up a few breakouts that were going on when I first started using. the only reason I knocked off a star is because the bottle I JUST purchased expires 7/2020 even though the bottle should be good for 12 months after opening. I'm sure I'll use it up much faster than 7/2020 but due to the price youd think that sephora wouldn't let this sit on the shelf for a year.",4
"love this body oil. so first let me say that I fell in live with the jasmine oil, and decided to give this one a go. this one is more moisturizing than the jasmine, and I feel like I dont have to use as much. it has a very pleasant mild smell. I wouldn't describe the smell as citrus. it doesnt smell as Devine as the jasmine, but I expected that based on the reviews. I love herbivore oils so much!",4
"Love this, ""Book of Shadows"" \nFormula is consistent, buildable and ultra blendable. The colour story makes sense to me, and the packaging is to die for. Well done. I'll be exploring more from Lunar Beauty for sure.",0
"love this cleanser, non oily, non greasy and it works, takes off ALL my shadow/ liner. BUT it doesn't disturb my lash extensions, had those for a year and life got so much better and cheaper after finding this (way less lash refills now). Will never cheat on this with another.",2
"LOVE this color, as it will go with either brighter colors or neutrals. I've only used it as a blush, but it's ideal, I would think for any age. I'm 56, with great skin and no lines, but am starting to age. This gave me the perfect pop of color. It will fit nicely in a purse, as well! Try it, I don't think anyone will be disappointed.",3
Love this concealer on my very oily acne prone skin and how it lasts all day and looks like skin still. However it does stay kinda wet all day and will crease under my very oily/moist eyes after only an hour of wear. This is easy to buff out as the day goes on but it may work better on really dry skin that needs that hydration.,0
"Love This Concealer so much, use it everyday and it stays with me. There was a point were I was taking bad care of my skin and it showed off that I was dry, but that one is on me for forgetting to moisturize\n\nOverall love the product to bits!",3
"Love this concealer! Super lightweight, yet still covers well and blends beautifully. It is not full coverage, but I like that because sometimes I feel like I'm putting thick paint on my face with other full coverage concealers. Pics below are without & with use! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",3
"Love this concept! I don't drink water often and I've been wanting to take something with collagen to help with my skin and hair. This is the perfect solution for both, and has vitamin c for an additional boost! I received this as a free sample. I like the sleek and cute container, which is so easy to throw in any sized purse. The tablet just dissolves in water without stirring, and it turns the water into a pretty pink hue. It's not too sweet and no funny texture added to the water like some powder does. The only downside is that the tablet breaks quite easily even in the container. I can't wait to see my skin's progress as I try it out every day.",0
"Love this cream - its light and super hydrating, perfect for my dry skin, even in the winter. However, it is really annoying to get the product out of the jar when you are running low. Deducted a star for poorly designed container",2
"Love this device! I received a complimentary device from @Influenster and it is fab! I used it on my friends forehead last night and you could instantly tell a difference. The lines were smoother. On I love being a girl note, it just makes me feel pretty!",2
"Love this easy, quick chemical peel type product. Works in five minutes and leaves the skin soft and ready to go. Use properly and you should look great in less than two weeks. And the price is amazing!",3
"love this!! everybody whose complaining that they're skin started breaking out, it's because your skin is purging. salicylic acid is designed to speed cell turnover. trust me all of those pimples would have eventually came to surface. the serum just loosens up all the dirt and dead skin cells. give it some time and you'll see amazing results. be patient. my skin started purging and now my skin is getting a lot smoother and I'm seeing A LOT less breakouts",1
"Love this! Everything creases on me, and I mean everything. This hardly creased at all, was an awesome match, and actually blurred my under eye area after using concealer on top. I'm 34 and have pretty deep and dark bags, but this took me back to my mid 20's haha. love this stuff.",1
"LOVE this eyeliner! Got this in my ipsy bag a long time ago, but I loved it so much I've bought so many times after that. Literally wear this everyday to the office on my waterline as a kohl eyeliner and it lasts all day. It glides onto your eye, but it can smudge a bit. As long as you aren't touching your eye it should be fine.",1
"love this face lotion, it's my go to I use everyday. only need a super small amount so it lasts longer than it seems like it will. super super moisturizing! \nI do however hate the container it's in. it's unnecessarily giant and has a small hole in it where the lotion goes. reminds me of getting a bag of chips and having only 1/3 of the bag be actual chips I can eat and the rest just air",1
Love this formula.  But really wish they would make a set with just the lip creams.  I don't want glitter on my lips!  I would love a set of lip creams in this smaller size to try out different colors.,3
"Love this foundation and have repurchased multiple times. I'm so impressed with the shade range, I find 290 is great for my tan skin/ olive undertone. The finish is matte but still natural and radiant. I have drier skin and as a matte foundarion-  this still works so well  for me, I just pat on transculent powder to my tzone to set. I enjoy that you dont need a whole lot of powder to set this, it really stays in place. I've worn it for 8-12 hours at times.  Can build coverage amazingly without looked cakey. I've used this with a brush, beauty blender, and fingers and loved the way it applied.",4
"Love this gloss, although it is quite pricey!  Once applied it is not sticky, although your hair will get caught in it.  This is a lovely brownish pink color.  All in all I'm very pleased.  I also have it in the interdit color.",3
"Love this!! I haven't tried essence other than essence included in face masks so this was cool to try. Love the packaging, the easy pump, and the texture. It applies very lightweight but don't let it fool you. I feel like it packs in hydration that lasts throughout the day. I use this in the morning underneath all my makeup and at night under my other skincare products. I also sometimes use it in place of moisturizer if I'm in a rush because I feel like it delivers enough moisture to get me through the day or night. It doesn't dry perfectly smooth (I don't know if essence ever does) - you can definitely tell it's there but I haven't had issues applying makeup or skincare on top. It also doesn't make me break out which is even better! Highly recommend.\n\n*I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.*",0
Love this!  I just got this the other day and am so glad to have found a really nice gel again.  I used to use Clinique's gel blush years ago and missed it. Looks natural and beautiful on the skin. Definitely buying more!,3
"Love this! I purchased a full size. It removed all my make-up, including my mascara - just massaged it in and used a damp cloth to remove. Plus it smells divine! Have purchased multiple times and still love it!",3
"Love this! I received this product to try as part of the Influenster review program. Always being an oily skinned girl I've stayed away from night time moisturizers as they tend to be heavy and greasy feeling. However, I actually got this just a couple of days before my ""50th"" birthday so I figured it's time to give something new a try. I LOVE it! I'm seeing a difference in my skin after using it for several days. It's not heavy and has a great light scent. People are always telling me that I don't look my age and I'm quite proud of that. My skin is evidence that I'm very picky about what I use. This product is going to remain part of my daily skin care regimen! My honest opinion is that it's great as are the other Fresh products that I've used!",2
"LOVE! This is the only mascara I've used consistently for nearly ten years now (always experimenting with others in between, but none have every come close!). First, it's hard to find an everyday brown mascara, and this one fits the bill. You only need one coat to get gorgeous, even coverage (I should add, with proper application technique, from root to tip with grip). It's easy to remove with micellar water or an oil-based makeup remover. I recommend this to people I know all the time, and definitely recommend on here as well!",0
"Love this!  It is a Saturday morning stand alone, and a weekday/night base for my routine.  It goes on easily, feels light, and gives just the right amount of soft color to look natural alone or moisturize and be the foundation for the rest of your look.",3
"love this! leave it to first aid beauty to bring us products we need and that work! I tried a few samples to be sure it wouldn't irritate my very sensitive skin, nope! it is awesome!! love it, and love having something that truly takes care of those pesky white little bumps that we all want to pop, but know...if we go down that road, it's long sleeves for a while!",3
"Love this lipstick! Bought the au natural color, it’s a pinky nude color, not too light, just perfect. Full coverage that feels super light. Slight plumping but nothing major. Doesn’t have great staying power but still worth it. The brushed gold metal case is gorgeous too. Love!!",2
"LOVE this lip tint! In fact I love all of Sephora's lip stains. They really do last all day, have great pigmentation and inexpensive. What I appreciate most about the lip tint over stains is you really can build layers to your desired depth.",4
Love this liquid eyeliner!! it's super user friendly with the felt tip which makes the lines way more precise! It is a deep matte black color that's very pigmented.   I make sure to keep it stored standing with tip down and shake it well before use. Great liner for those who love amazing wings!,2
"Love this little brush, perfect for travel and touch ups. I love all Marc jacob brushes I have the full set! This one is great for liquid foundation and cream products. Defiantly a must if you love brushes like I do",0
"Love this little kit. Allows you to try the items and see if you like them. The lip oil is the best thing. Just enough color and feels amazing on the lips. Especially for dry lips, definitely a remedy.",1
"Love this little REFA.  I actually felt it wake up a part of my face beneath my cheekbones, and in just 2 weeks once/day it is making a slight difference in my sagging jowls. I'm sensitive to RF and EMF, and REFA does put out a lot of RF.  So I use it gently and only repeat ""strokes"" a few times.",4
"Love this little set!  My normal blush is orgasm but wanted to try the Dolce Vita and its beautiful. It is a great travel size.  Definitely more of a plum type blush, a little goes a long way.  The lip balm is so nice, prettily pigmented and really light in consistency.  Its a nice one to wear around the house just to look a little cuter ;)",1
"Love this mascara! It makes my lashes look full and long without being clumpy or over the top. I wear this literally every day at work, and it holds up well with little to no flaking or smearing in a fairly hot environment. I have found my holy grail mascara!",4
"Love this mask. Every time I use it I feel like I'm putting lemon pudding on my face. It looks and smells just like lemon pudding. I love lemon pudding! Very hydrating - by morning my skin feels so soft and looks plumped, with most of my smile lines ironed out. I have had blemishes show up a couple of times after using this, but I don't think this is the culprit as I tend to only apply this mask on nights when my skin feels in need of intensive intervention, when it feels like pollution or less-than-healthy eating or stress have taken a toll. I haven't really seen a difference in my skin tone/hyperpigmentation, but I don't use it often - maybe 1-2 times a month.",3
"Love this multi-stick.  I am in my mid-30s and am a no-makeup makeup person.  Very fair skin with cool undertones.  Beautiful shade, gives the most natural flush and I love to apply the tiniest bit in my nose for a very natural look.  Not long wearing but reapplies well.  I apply about 4 little swipes on the apples of my cheeks and blend/pat in with my finger.  If I’ve over-applied, I use my Real Techniques expert face brush to absorb the excess.  Love this product and also apply to my lips then add a sheer gloss, like a Burt’s Bees in a light pink.  Again, not long wearing BUT natural looking, beautiful/healthy finish and clean ingredients.",0
"Love this night cream!! i use the Keils Midnight Recovery Oil, then this, every single night, and I love it!! its lasted me over 6 months, and I still have PLENTY left! wish this came in a smaller size, but its definitely worth the price!! I wake up to baby soft skin every morning, and Im about to purchase the day cream!! Very impressed by this line!",2
"love this palette I love the red hued browns. the first metallic in this palette, the rose gold shade, is very very crumbly though. the shade is GORGEOUS but it needs foiled which is kind of annoying. still love this palette its pretty much my go to!",4
"Love this palette! The colors are lovely, and each one lasts for hours after application. I used my fingers to apply it but you can use a sponge or brush as well. The shimmer is absolutely beautiful and the ingredients are better than most. The blush powder is quite sheer but you can build it up. The bronzer works perfectly for contouring. I have light skin and this palette will work well for pale to medium complexions. Plus it comes with a nice mirror and is a really nice product for the price.",4
"Love this palette!  The colors are perfect.  My favorite is the blush as I have light skin and usually do not wear blush because it is often too dark or bright; this is perfect.  Tarte, if you're listening, please make a 'Winter Feels' set.",3
"Love this pallet! was able to create the perfect makeup look for my costume. I mainly used My Angels & Stev, but I also find myself using some of the other colors for a soft glam every day look. Great pigmentation. Beautiful color options, that actually show up on my skin tone.",1
"Love this powder! It does what everyone says and more. My only gripe is that I can't get the excess powder out of the container. It starts to get to the last 1/8 of the tub and I can't get anymore out and I can't open the tub to get to the rest. I can see it on the sides, but alas I have to throw out product. Major bummer.",0
"love this primer! I have combination skin, and I dont like the smell, but I dont notice it after application, and this primer helps keep my makeup in place all day and I never have to worry about my foundation wearing off.",4
"Love this product and while I didn't take any before or after photos, I believe my skins has brightened.\n\nBut and this is a big one. Vitamin C is unstable and should not be exposed to light. But the container is transparent! Yikes....",3
"Love this product but Sephora does not carry all of the colors of it, so I have to buy it from its maker (and I'd rather stick a fork in my eye than buy from them directly).  Sephora:  GET ALL THE COLORS PLEASE.",2
"Love this product. Goes on beautifully, smells good and actually seems to work. I will admit I hadn't been paying attention to any improvements in my dark circles since I was more concerned with some stubborn hormonal acne (yuck). Till my boyfriend made a comment that I looked well rested and must be sleeping better. Sleeping better was unfortunately not the case but this eye cream definitely helped me to look less like a trash panda and more human.",1
Love this product. I have a bad habit of constantly licking my lips. This is wonderful because instead of getting a dreaded line around my lips this just evenly fades out leaving a nice cherry stain on my lips. Perfect for date night. It barely transfers after drying.,0
love this product. It helps moisturize my thirty-year-old under eyes and makes my wrinkles less apparent and with Tom pumps that part of the skin up I like the fact it's not to moisturize and but even though it doesn't come really big literally a very small little bit goes a long way,1
love this product over all but was disappointed that the majority of it is overspray and u only get the gold skin and the purple hair but still love it great design very faltering on my pale skin would recommend,3
"love this product soo much!! went into Sephora cause I'm getting married in September and I have sensitive skin!! I was on the hunt for my own foundation cause my make up artist recommended I do that, so I talked to one of the ladies there and she helped me soo much!! introduced me to this product and my skin has been starting to feel fabulous!!!",2
"Love this product, which is why I’m rating it five stars! Unfortunately, I have had the same experience with the product falling out of the compact and breaking into tiny pieces. Once with the mini size and once with the full size. I am very careful with pressed powders, using my brush lightly and evenly on the product. It appears now it may be a manufacturer’s defect.",2
"LOVE THIS!!!  Removes all my eye makeup, contouring makeup and even matte lip colors.  I have combination skin and didn't make my oily parts MORE oily and perfectly moisturized my dry parts.  it is now part of my routine face care...",3
Love this set! I found the eyeshadows to be beautifully pigmented and very wearable (with the exception of the chunky glitter shades). I also love the liquid lipstick and of course the amazing Better Than Sex mascara! A wonderful set for a decent price!,0
love this shade for the cooler temperatures (I was specifically looking for something for my winter routine- a bit of colour to lightly blend in with my white winter complexion) this does the trick! Also the gold is just a light single layer that can be brushed off.,1
"Love this size to try and I'll be buying the original size. Keeps my makeup in place and it doesn't feel thick like other primers I've tried. The other thick primers I've tried seems to also make me hot and then I sweat easy and then there goes my makeup! But not with this, I feel like my skin can still breathe, it's light yet works very well at keeping my face",2
"Love this so much! Goes on beuautifuilly, sets to a power/matte finish and is long lasting! I have been disappointed with stick foundations in the past but this one is different. So easy to apply and actually gives great coverage (I have lots of hyperpigmentation) that doesn't slip off your face and has not broken me out. Can't wait to wear this in the summer.",0
"Love this stuff!  At 57, I don't want my shadow to go into my eyelid creases.  This solved that issue, plus helped my shadow to stay put for 18 hours .  Highly recommend.  Goes on easily, I used my finger to smooth the applicaton across my eyelid.  Non-irritating for my sensitive eyes.  So pleased!",3
love this stuff. feels great and is really sheer. took off one star because the base of the lipstick broke the first time i used it even though i was really gentle with it. now i have to be really careful when i use it and a lot gets wasted. still worth buying though.,1
Love this stuff! I've been trying so many different products to get rid of little bumps on my face. This worked after using it for 2 days! I use it a few times a week and also use it as a mask. Highly recommend this product!,1
"Love this sunscreen. I received a sample size earlier on and immediately really liked it. It helps reduce and regulate my sebum on my nose as well, making my entire face appear smoother. Now I have the full size and will be sticking with this one for a while!",0
"Love this. The ""self-setting"" call out scared me because I thought it might be drying but its actually perfect. It blends out super easily with brush, sponge, or fingers and sets just the right amount so it doesn't gather or cake up but it does stay in place without powder.",3
Love this tinted moisturizer! It adjusts to my natural skin tone ... has spf and it works not like others that say it had an spf snd it really doesn’t. I also use this when sun bathing bc of the tinted color and spf. Stays all day even after swimming ... love love love this,3
"Love this to refresh and perk up throughout the day. Lightly scented to not provoke allergies (I would know). I love to use this as the essence step in my morning and evening skin routine. The rose helps tone and hydrate  and with a spray nozzle, it's the best cheap but effective essence ever. I just love how versatile it is!",4
"Love this! You're only supposed to use this up to every other day if you have oily skin, but I wish I can use it everyday. The key is to keep the skin taut, use LOTS of water, and press firmly. I have combination skin, so I can see that I get much more out of my pores in my T-zone area, and almost none on my cheeks.\n\nI don't know how to check if the serum infuser works, but I do love the idea of being able to increase the effectiveness of my serum. In time we'll see if it is actually effective. Currently, the only way I can tell if anything is happening is by the slight warmth when I use it against my skin.",0
"Love what this does for my skin. The glow is amazing, and the exfoliation is great. I can't live without this product.  Just start off slow if you've never used acids, use once every 2 or 3 days for a few weeks and work up to daily or twice daily use.\nMy only negative is that the packaging on the big bottle can leak, and on the smaller one it can get sticky all over. Probably a nature of the formula, and I can live with it since its great. Just consider keeping in a vanity tray rather than your counter.",1
loving this so far. I wanted a clean foundation but with good coverage and this is really great. a little thicker than I was expecting but love the dropper. can be built to a solid high medium coverage (I have dark red acne scars and this covers most of them) + lasts a really good time without setting with powder or spray,0
LSS: I've tried many mask without discipline. I always give or toss it cause nothing do anything on my my mature skin A young lady in sephora store recommended this masque. I've tried it by adding some water and massaged and left it on for just 10 mins. Then use warm wet paper towel and remove it and my face . OMG. It looks polished fresh. I love it.,3
"Made me breakout! I’m someone who uses a mask (sheet, clay, modeling, etc.) every other day. Most of them are k-beauty sheet masks and I use different kinds depending on how my skin is feeling that day. Though I have sensitive skin, I often use 3-4 different masks in given week. This one made me break out and irritated my skin a ton!\n\nWill definitely be returning to my k-beauty masks until my skin calms down.",0
"Made me break out like crazy and pretty sure it caused a major eczema flare up. It had a bit of a slimy feel to it and felt like it just sat on my skin, never seemed to absorb. Gross. Pitched it immediately.",3
"Makes my eyes look so crepey when I use it on my eyelids underneath eyeshadow.  I also tried using it as  it for a concealer under my eyes, and again it showed lots of fine lines.  I don’t recommend at all for older skin!",3
"make sure you apply this ALL over your face and let it set for a minute otherwise you'll end up with patchy makeup in areas as I made that mistake before. It looks so much better when I apply it all over, also helps my makeup resist sweating off from my excessively sweaty forehead. I'll get the mini size of this the next time I get paid. Don't rub it in too much especially after it sets for a min because it can peel and flake.",1
"Mario Badescu toners are hands down some of the best on the market for my sensitive/reactive skin. There are no superfluous ingredients, just highly effective formulas. This one is in a tie for my favorite with the gentle glycolic toner. When my skin is irritated it's the first thing I reach for. I also use it as a spritz throughout the day to give irritated skin a boost. A holy grail product, for me.",1
Master Flash is a must have for festival season. The goes awesome with any holographic or purple look especially. One thing I would say is shave if you are going to put it on your arms or legs because it slick hair down like gel. The glitter laster hours and hours. Huge amount of product lasts forever.,1
"Maybe I'm just dumb, but the shape of this lippie makes it SO hard to apply. I realize this wouldn't be an issue if I used a brush, but that's not practical for on the go. That said, I love the color and it looks really natural on and doesn't bleed!",4
"Maybe it's my fault.  I bought this 6 months ago, but was trying to finish some other liners first.  This liner was kept in it's original packing and stored in a dark, dry place.  Opened it for the first time today and it was almost completely dry.  Couldn't even draw one eye's liner. I guess this product has an extremely short shelf life, even if left unopened.",2
"medium to full coverage depending on how much is used during application. There is a rather strong fragrance so for those who are more sensitive, I'l say to try and get a sample first. The smell does gradually fade away and isn't as string once on. I liked the finish look. I was afraid it would pull at my skin but it wore comfortably all night. I hate the application though, it is hard to blend. The first time I used 3 brushes though the first brush I can say was due to trial and error. But it def needs to be buffed out. Maybe a sponge works better but I rather work with brushes.",1
"Mehh... More like a tinted sunscreen.  If it were sold as such, I might give it 4 stars.  Doesn't correct or mask imperfections.  I do like that it is silicone (dimethicone) free. Smells somewhat like dog pee but the smell goes away a few minutes after application.",1
"Meh. \nI used this product breifly and saw no difference in my skin (I have every dry acne prone skin), I did get a little bit of bumps under the skin but nothing major.\nI use on my BF nightly atop his other creams (he has aged normal/dry skin) and again I don't see too much of a difference after a month of use, maybe a bit of hydration and smoothing.\nIt is a very light cream and I find it odd they ask you to apply it over top your entire night time routine. The ingredients are OK, they promise a lot but I didn't see much of a difference. It does have a lot of fragrance.\nNot a product you need to buy in my opinion. I feel like there are better products especially for the price.",4
Mila prone 25 dry skin worried about aging. this product is great in combination with my retnoid cream which dries me out and irritates my skin. I use it every night regardless of retnoid now though and wake up up fresh baby like skin every morning,4
"Miracle Worker. I have small acne bumps on my cheeks near my mouth and NOTHING, not even Benzoyl Peroxide works for me anymore. I grabbed this at Sephora on Sunday with my points(Sample size). I used it Monday night before bed and I woke up and 80% of the acne is gone. Thank the Lord. I am pleased, now I have to invest in a full-size product. Grab this ladies!",1
"Miranda Kerr skin in a tube, these masks are amazing!  I will not be using any product under the sleeping mask again as I did wake up with a pimple on my chin but also decreased wrinkle appearance under my eyes.",2
"Mixed on this. I feel like my breakouts are not as frequent, but I still get little ones here and there. Which is going to happen...I understand that. However, not sure I can see myself purchasing this in the future. I am halfway through the bottle so I will know by the time I finish it. I am glad I got to try it!",1
"Mixed skin type problems..Normally around my nose is oily, everywhere else I get dry patches. I have used it TWICE now, and my patches are gone and my nose isn't oily. I also have very sensitive skin/eczema and it has not caused any poor reactions.***BONUS** my husband noticed the difference aswell!",0
"More opal or iridescent snow colors, super pretty but it's also very chunky. the palette out of package is uneven and lumpy because of the coarse glitters. Application isn't terrible but even with primer I still get a bit of immediate fallout, by the end of the night my face is covered with this",0
"Most difficult product of this type I've used, and I've tried several, including a very inexpensive drug store product. Bought this because it was recommended by my plastic surgeon. Never could get the right combo that would smooth wrinkles without having a white film develop.",2
"Mostly, I was curious when I bought it - lip oil?? But I have to say, it has quickly become one of my faves! The color is really subtle, but what I like most is how light and moisturizing it is. If you're tired of lip balm, give this a try! You won't regret it!",2
"Most of the reviews here are spot on.  If you have sensitive skin, this enzyme mask will sting.  If you're used to chemical exfoliants, it's not too bad.  The reason for my 3-star review is because I didn't find the aluminum oxide particles to be fine enough.  They felt more like sugar particles, so a bit more abrasive than what I'm looking for in a physical exfoliant.  Also, I really can't stand jar products.  I realize it's a cheaper alternative to a pump or squeeze bottle container, but it makes for a messy jar and it's difficult to get the appropriate amount on your hands/fingers to apply to your face.  Or maybe it's just me?",2
"Most of the time, I'll pair this concealer with my tinted moisturizer, and I'll consistently get compliments on my skin. It has great coverage, but it still looks like my skin. I docked 2 stars because I recently brought this on a trip, and it leaked everywhere. I even cleaned it off after the first leak, and double-checked that I had tightened the lid, but later I opened up my toiletries bag to find a mess (see photo). If you're keeping it at home and upright, you'll be fine, otherwise beware of the risk of it getting everywhere.",2
"Moved to Arizona and wore it on a VERY warm day.  I put it on well before going outside, thought I was protected.  I got a sunburn!  My face does not hurt but was not expecting to burn.  I have worn it for close to a month and this is the first time I got burnt.  I did not change the amount.  I always did 2 pumps because it covered my face and chest.",2
"Muddy, skipped, couldn't blend & patchy. I already submitted a review but somehow it was posted on the smoke sessions palette which I have NOT purchased. I returned this palette yesterday in store. I tried with & without primer along with different brushes. Nothing made a difference. I tested out the Smoke sessions while in store & the metallics/shimmers were awesome but again the mattes were HORRIBLE.",3
"Must-have for the Bare Minerals liquid foundation. Had fallen out of love with the foundation until I got this brush ... now I can't believe the difference that the liquid foundation, applied with this brush, makes! Highly recommend!",3
"My 60 y/o mom has started getting watery eyes and greasy eyelids in the last few years. She's always loved makeup but since it's become an issue for her to wear eyeshadow and eyeliner, she's stopped wearing it. I bought her this and showed her how to apply it, and she's so happy! It doesn't wear off her eyes and stays looking fresh all day, despite her eye issues - plus it doesn't irritate her eyes at all. She can wear eye makeup and feel pretty again. She wants me to buy her some more of these now :) Highly recommend!",0
"My absolute favorite setting spray with SPF. I’ve tried other sprays that don’t work or smell as well, and this has SPF to boot. No flecks, no breakouts, no streams of liquid. You have to make sure the nozzle is clear, as with any spray product. Hope they never let go of this product",2
"My actives have all slowly been replaced by TO and it started with this retinol. It's inexpensive and effective but—as long as you smartly ease into use—it won't fry your face. The thick but slippy consistency applies easily and you only need a few drops. I give it a few minutes to soak in and follow up with moisturizing serum or sheet mask and a hydrating moisturizer. After building up to it, I alternate nights with TO Mandelic Acid, then their Ascorbic Acid in the mornings—since starting this routine, I haven't had any cystic acne and any small pimples that pop up are gone in a day. My skin texture is improving and (with continued, consistent sunscreen use) my acne scars and fine lines are noticeably fading. This retinol is such a flipping good bargain and I'm so glad it exists.",1
My all time favorite concealer. The mini is a great travel or back up when I run out of the regular size. I’ve tried a lot of concealers for my acne scars and this product makes them disappear. Blends perfectly and doesn’t crust up.,1

My Becca highlighter was broken when received.  that was a bummer because it was one of the best products in this kit.  the CT eye pencil was very disappointing because it's basically chunky glitter.  also the tarte eye cream was pretty chunky too.  the bronzer is pretty and the dew drops are nice.,2
"My boyfriend likes to joke that my skin is like a solar panel - it just soaks up the sun. Funny but also true. After one visit to the beach this summer, my skin wasn't the same. I noticed it became dry, flaky, and felt textured to the touch. Exfoliating was my first go-to, but that didn't seem to help. A Sephora employee recommended this mask and after one use my skin is back to its normal, radiant, dewy self! This product is amazing and replenished all the nutrients the sun soaked out of my skin. Will definitely purchase the full-sized product and try other products from PTR!",0
"My combination/mostly dry and sensitive skin is slowly recovering from a couple of years of adult cystic acne. I ended up seeing a dermatologist, and the products she recommended helped end the cycle but, almost a year later, my skin was still noticeably congested on my cheeks and still showing some acne scars near my jawline. \n\nThis product was suggested to me by one of the Sephora salespeople, who said she also had sensitive skin that had recovered from cystic acne and said it worked wonders for her. \n\nI bought the small size but I will definitely be back for the larger one when this runs out, it's amazing. The general congestion on my cheeks is gone after one use and I can see a significant reduction in the scarring/discolouration at my jaw. I probably won't shut up about it for a while, I'm that excited; no other mask has improved my skin by this much - I currently use a charcoal-based mask once or twice a week and, while it's great at getting rid of blackheads, it had only helped the congestion and scarring a little.\n\nIt does tingle quite a bit, to begin with but it calms down and it's not unbearable for 20 minutes. I can't wait to use it next weekend!",4
"My daughter and I both are loving the lineage water bank hydro gel and the hydro essance i love to put it on a clean face after washing and before i do my makeup it sinks right into my skin and feels so light but so moisturized and fresh at the same time :) it makes my foundation or cc cream go on my face looking flawless i can honestly say laneige is now in my top two favorite skin care brands im 34 and it is helping my dry skin and crows feet tremendously i could tell from my 3rd application that my face is loving it! And my 15 year old daughter is loving it as well its fragrance free so it is working perfectly for her she struggles with acne and has had trouble finding moisturizers, gels, essance anything that wont break her out and this seems to be a go to everyday skin care for the both of us if I hadn't had these sent to me complimentary for an honest review I never would have bought them I'm so grateful so thubs up from us we love it thank you so much to influenster and laneige!",1
"My daughter's moderate-severe acne has calmed down quite a bit since she started this product. She is only 12, but most acne products sold at places like Target were not working. Even Clinique was not working for her. I thought I'd give this a try before sending her to the dermatologist and it worked. Now, some nights she skips using this product, and wham-o! New acne starts popping up all over. You must use it faithfully if you have very oily, acne prone skin like my daughter.",1
my entire life I have thought there's something wrong with my skin or the oils in me or the way I applied makeup or my makeup itself. at the end of the day I always looked like I'd been on a 2 day bender. I'd tried other primers. smashbox and too faced. no change. when I got home after a long 9 hour shift my makeup looked like I just did it 20 minutes before. seriously life changing. I cant live without it now. highly recommend!!! the ONLY necessity i own,0
"My face is always very dry and flaky, but this serum leaves my skin hydrated all day. It gets rid of the redness in my face and smells very fresh. It does leave a tacky feeling but i use it at night and by the morning the feeling is gone. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.",0
"My FAVE foundation! It does not settle in smile creases and fine lines, blurs texture, has SPF, lasts a really long time through long days of work out in the sun, and fades beautifully after 10-12 hours. Please be aware this is  light to medium coverage so it won't fully cover acne or acne scars that well. I HAVE to use concealer for my spots.\n\nPros:\n-For neutral undertones, this shade range is perfect! Every neutral foundation either turns too pink or yellow on me in regular sunlight. Shiseido makes the perfect neutral tones.\n-SPF, a must have \n-Withstands humidity, sweat, and little to moderate rain\n-Looks fresh even after 10 hours with blotting \n\nCons:\n-SPF may cause slight flashback on darker skin tones but if you're light to medium, you should be fine in flash photography.\n-Poor shade range for darker skin tones past Medium. The range skips for deeper skin tones.\n-This has a natural matte finish. Dry skin types will love this but if you have combo-oily, powder is a must! I pair this with the Too Faced Peach Perfect powder and this combo makes my makeup bulletproof.",0
"My Favorite Daily Mascara!  I tried this a couple of years ago in the mascara sample bundle and fell in love.  My favorite thing that it doesn't do is flake off in black spheres like so many of the other popular brands.  It is just perfect in separating and curling my lashes.  My eyelashes look naturally long, dark and thick - just like they did when I was a child. It applies so very easily and it so a piece of cake to remove.  LOVE this mascara!",3
"My favorite daily moisturizing oil. My skin is prone to drying and breakouts, however this oil leaves my face soft and smooth for 24 hours. A few drops goes a long way, and is perfect underneath a light coverage foundation (leaves a dewy appearance). I’ve tried using coconut oil and vitamin e oil but it causes my skin to break out. I’ve also tried creams like Tatcha Water Cream but it wasn’t enough for my dry skin. This product is really great if you have drier, sensitive skin!",0
"My favorite eye cream to use. The lines around my eyes are significantly smoother, my eye area is brighter and I look more awake. It feels very light and absorbs quickly. It really does wonders for lines and for a lifting effect. I only wish it was more moisturizing. That is my only qualm. This is the best for a treating/treatment for  my eyes but I need to layer a moisturizer on top at night. On hot days and in the morning I use only this. This is the best eye cream/serum. I think most eye creams/serums are bogus and have alot of fillers and buffers(like wax, silicone) or simply lightly hydrate. This actually works. Dont ever discontinue this!",4
"My favorite go-to makeup essential. The picture I submitted for this review is the powder only with just a whisper of blush. No primer, no concealer, no foundation; just some Ponds moisturizing cream. This powder provides excellent coverage. I'm almost 50, some redness on my cheeks, no age spots (yet!), and I get a porcelain finish. I am very pale, and the #15 is spot on for me.  Very highly recommend.",3
My favorite lip balm by far (and I've tried A LOT of lip balms). I stockpile this stuff and pretty much have a tube in every room. Absolutely love how it doesn't feel sticky but stays on and softens my lips.,2
"My favorite liquid eyeliner!! kat von d tattoo eyeliner is a runner up, but it always dries out too quickly for me. this has such a smooth application, and a dark, thick pigment and formula. it never runs, it's not watery, and it goes on perfect every time. it last all night or all day but also comes off easily with makeup remover. some eyeliners also have that ""eraser"" affect when you add more to it, but this never does that. highly recommend",0
my favorite mask in the sephora line. my face felt smooth and soft and looked like porclean. Even in the morning when I woke up my skin still looked and felt great and lasted all day. This will be my go to mask,4
"My favorite oil blotting tissues.  I like everything charcoal because it’s neat  to use a black item.  The tissue has a mild fresh scent and takes away the shine.  The fascination of seeing the how much oil is absorbed by the tiny tissues.  On stressful days, I need to use 2 tissues.",3
My favorite Sephora skin product so far.  I put on a generous layer at night.  Will sometimes boost with a serum in winter.  Skin looks plump and hydrated the next morning.  Love the signature clover smell - sweet and fresh.,3
"My favorite stack! The shade scammin is perfection and baby girl is stunning. Such a pretty a pretty color story, definitely spring and summer feel but I love it so much it's an all year round stack for me.",3
"My first Lunar Beauty purchase and I am on the fence. It is a beautiful palette and it does have a scent of strawberries. With that being said the mattes are a bit of work to blend out and I find most of the shimmers to be sheer in pigment. Shimmers also create quite a bit of fallout. All that can be worked with and the looks I have created are beautiful. However, the biggest issue I had with this palette was when I applied Haze and Strawberry Moon I had a burning sensation that did not reside. Had to completely remove the eyeshadow. Never had that happen with any eyeshadow palette before.",4
My first PM purchase ever and I am so pleased!  I traveled to WI from NY and nothing broke.  I used the shadows for a mermaid/siren look and it turned out amazing. The color built up easily it's very pigmented and blends like a dream.,1
"My first Tom Ford palette and I wasn't impressed.  I like it,  but I don't love it enough to justify the price.  The 2 top shades are beautiful toppers, but the 2 bottom shades I have to build and build to show up on my medium skin tone and the darkest shade turns grey on me.  I went ahead and bought the Body Heat palette and I am glad I did. That wet dry formula is beautiful. This formula, not worth the $75. The packaging is beautiful though...",2
"My foundation has been getting more and more textures no matter the exfoliator or moisturizer I used. I went to Sephora and was reccomended this- And I am sl grateful! My makeup is now so much smoother than is to this stuff. I was surprised at the price, but it was worth every penny!",0
My friend got me this for Christmas and I was a bit skeptical considering my OCD with skincare but decided to try it. I absolutely could not believe the level of hydration my skin had when I woke up to see it not dry and flaking. I highly recommend this to anyone with dry and oil prone skin. It leaves the skin feeling protected with a layer that feels very much like a silicone makeup primer without the oily feeling some overnight creams have. Also absorbs completely into the skin which was what I was looking for.,0
My go to lipstick.  I got a mini in Icon a few years ago as a sample and was hooked.   I had been searching for a matte lipstick for ages but was never happy with any of them.  I bought a full size Empress a few weeks later and have never looked back.  The color is rich and it stays put all day.,2
"My go to setting spray! The price is amazing & the spray smells like a bouquet of roses!! It hydrates me just enough, but doesn't make me extra dewy! I also spritz it in my hair to hydrate it & make it smell nice!",2
"My hands are all cracked, peeling and have water bubbles from ezcema.  This hand cream feels really nice on the hands.  It makes my hands feel soft and not dry, but this feeling is gone as soon as you wash your hands.  I've been using it daily for a month now and my dry hands have shown no improvement in the long run, just temporary softness.",4
"My holy grail cleanser. The only cleanser I'll ever need for the rest of my life. It foams well, so I expect this bottle to last me a very long time. Perhaps a year.\n\nThis has replaced my need for:\n\n- Peeling gels/chemical exfoliants. Bye bye REN Glow Tonic (my former holy grail)!\n\n- Anti-acne treatments (salicylic acid actually makes my blackheads WORSE!)\n\n- Popping blackheads daily because this actually cleans my pores. All of the other cleansers that say they'll clean your pores are liars. This is the only one telling the truth!\n\n- Antioxidant ""glow/radiance"" serums\n\n- Most makeup remover. I still use eye makeup remover for my eyeliner/mascara, but a pump of this massaged for a minute removes the rest of my face. I follow up with another cleanse or two after that, just to be sure.\n\n[The pump of the full-size turns sideways to lock closed for travel. The mini doesn't, but that comes with a lid.]",0
"My holy grail foundation has gotten so hard to find I needed to move on (Chanel Sublimage La Tint) it took years to find something that worked so well for me I've been in a panic on how to replace it. I have dry skin what's fairly even but want a flawless natural base that will stay all day. heavy coverage gets cakey, BB creams wear off, most foundations crackle or gather on me, generally making me look older than I do bare faced! it's been a long expensive road to finding a suitable replacement foundation.\n\nThere's been some mixed reviews on this but I had faith and most of the complaints were that it wasn't superfull coverage or too dewey for oily/combo skin... which would make sense for my needs. I have been using Pat McGrath now for 10 days in a row and it's beautiful. Not the same as my previous le tint but the end result is natural real-skin look that is healthy, even, and glowing. Doesn't budge all day IF you apply in very thin layers, building only where you need it. Best technique for me: buff 1 pump in w a brush across entire face, then damp clean beauty blender to pick up any excess. repeat with half pump where needed. a light dusting of powder and I'm good for 10+ hours. I look good, vibrant, awake, and people think I'm on a new diet healthkick at work because my skin just looks good.",2
"My husband bought this palette for me and I love it. I have to agree though, when compared to the online pictures, this palette is not that Rosey and is more like a cool tone beige, so be warned. \n\nI personally love the colours and the formula is amazing. It is buttery smooth, it is easy to blend and build up the intensity. I have been using this palette everyday. It's a slim, compact palette with what I call ""no brainier"" colours, I can grab this pallette and easily make a look that I know works well with anything I'm wearing. I don't have to think much when I use this palette, which is great for my speedy mornings.",1
"My husband gave me this as a present, because I really fell in love with it at the store and it's amazing. I use it every day and a tiny pump is enough to give me a lot of glow. not the unicorn kind of glow, but the healthy ""I am drinking 3 l of water a day, and just got back from my relaxing trip from somewhere exotic"" kind of glow, which is kind of what I was trying to go for. definitely recommend the bottle lasts around a year for me. probably even longer since j also use it on my collarbone or shoulders in the summer time",0
"My lashes are super straight and the only thing that works for me is a lash curler and waterproof mascara. I've pretty much tried them all and this one ranks high. It's not necessarily volumizing, but it lengthens and holds the curl. I'm really pleased with this purchase.",4
My lashes were long and full when used with or without the recommended primer. The mascara lasted all day and I never had to reapply. You get a lot with the packaging which is perfect because it's a pricey brand. Will purchase in the future. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1
"My legs are very fair and pink-toned with blue veins. Because pantyhose aren't in fashion and are just plain uncomfortable, I gave up wearing skirts and dresses a long time ago. I bought this to try in the Light/Medium shade. I did a practice application a few days before an event and decided two coats was best. It smoothed on easily. I did take extra care around the ankles and tops of feet, where I learned that it could accumulate and look patchy. It also washed clean off my hands after applying and washed away in the shower as promised. Did it give me an instant, noticeable tan? No. But here's what it did for me: It warmed up the tone of my legs and neutralized those veins. And I wore a skirt bare-legged and with confidence for the first time in decades.",3
"My lips are extremely dry, that I have to moisturize 24/7. This product does not work at all. Taste and feels like medicine, which would have been fine if it worked. Dries super fast and you will be left with severe dry lips.",0
My medium deep skin with yellow undertones loves this color. My new go to warm nude. It's youthful and doesn't look like an over done pink lip. Transitions from work to workout to evening! This YSL lipstick is one of the most moisturizing lipsticks I've ever worn. I ordered 2 additional colors.,1
My new favorite body oil. I apply right after the shower the oil absorbs quickly while leaving my skin soft all day. It has a light scent but once applied it wears off pretty quickly. I use the oil daily so I'm not sure how long the bottle last but the price tag would be the only reason I wouldn't repurchase regularly.,2
My new favorite concealer. I cant put into word exactly how much i love this concealer. It is so light weight and thin but with amazing coverage. I recieved the voxbox from influencer and put it right on my face. I was so impressed that it didnt settle into the lines under my eyes because most concealers do. I would give it 10 stars id i could. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,2
My new favorite foundation. This formula fixed everything that was an issue with the original.  I have dry skin and the original left me flawless but tight. This formula still flawless but I can move my face. The color is also better. 420 in the original is a little orange.  The hydrating formula 420 is the perfect neutral pecan undertone I need. PERFECTION!,2
"My new favorite setting powder!! This is absolutely perfect for keeping my makeup in place all day and looking fresh, even in 100 degree heat. I don't get oily when using this powder, even on my chin and forehead where I usually do. I don't have to do touch ups throughout the day either. And the package is HUGE. I won't need to buy a new one for months. My new holy grail powder!",1
"My new HG serum! I bought not having high expectations despite all the good reviews (I'm a bit jaded after trying so many ""miracles"" that just left me unimpressed). I've tried and liked a few Ordinary products (their retinol is one of few I can use without flaking or irritation and I'm really digging the ""blood mask"") but I wasn't expecting such immediate and noticeable results as Buffet gave me. Within the first week of using this remarkable serum, my hydration levels have increased dramatically, my coarse wrinkles in my forehead and undereye have faded, my pores (ALWAYS a source of discontent) look SO much smaller and refined and my skin has stayed clear even through my usual ""time of the month"" breakout cycle. For under $20, I couldn't BE more impressed. Buffet even soothed my skin on my chin after I got really overzealous with exfoliating and had a rash with peeling, flaking skin that nothing I previously used would touch. I top Buffet with Perricone Essential Fx moisturizer (another HG for me) and my skin looks 8-10 years younger. I do find the serum sticky upon initial application but topping it with moisturizer completely gets rid of that for me. I pray Sephora keeps The Ordinary line and expands to include their foundations (also wonderful products).",3
"My nose is incredibly oily, and this is one of the few things that actually helps keep the oil at bay when I apply it under my foundation in the morning. I also use it to ""blot"" later on and it is completely translucent on me, though I am very pale. I love it!",2
"My older combination skin looks dry whenever I use foundations other than those deemed ""Radiant"", no matter what primer or moisturizer I use (matte foundations are a true horror).  I found a cream foundation that I liked and used for a few years, but when this came along I tried it for a change. The Medium coverage does what it's supposed to do and the color works well on my skin. I haven't tested the 24h* part but so far, it doesn't seem to melt off or disappear. Will repurchase.",4
"My only complaint about Gimmie Brow is that in all of the other products, shade 3 is warm and 3.5 is more neutral; except for Gimmie Brow. (it's reversed with these, for some reason?) Other than this minor quirk, Benefit makes the best brow products, without a doubt. I'm a redhead with platinum blonde invisibrows and it is so difficult to find brow products for myself; however, I've loved everything I've ever tried from Benefit. Shade 3 (3.5 in Gimmie) is absolutely perfect, looks natural, is not orange or too blonde/brown. The Precisely My Brow pencil is super fine and makes really natural looking strokes. I love using a combination of Kabrow for the tails, Goof Proof to shape and shade, Precisely to add a few hairs to the center ends and then run a bit of Gimmie Brow through to keep them in place and add dimension and volume. I've tried SO many different brow products and this combination is absolutely the best!",2
"My only regret is not taking a before and after photo. My lashes are noticeably longer and I can go without mascara too. \n\nBe patient though. I noticed a difference about 4 weeks in, but the wow factor didn't hit until week 8 or 9.",3
My review is similar to one below: my skin is oily all year round-hot or cold. I live in a cold climate. this primer did not keep me matte even for an 8hr work day! I still had to blot within the first 2-3hrs of application. I'm not happy with Huda's matte based products,1
"My Sephora is inside a JCPenny, so they don't carry as much as a freestanding Sephora. I went out on a limb & purchased this online & hoped for the best, bc this is pretty pricey. I am so glad I did. This is so freaking beautiful. It is perfect for summer. The glow it gives is one I try so hard to achieve. It plays well with other products, which is very important to me. This with a little highlighter, mascara, eyebrow gel & dewy setting spray is my go to for summer. I have also mixed it with other foundations ( Estee Lauder Double Wear, Nars Sheer Glow) & it gives a beautiful glowy effect with more coverage. I don't love the smell, but I can live with it. I am loving this & I definitely recommend.",4
"My sister's favorite eyeliner brand for like 10 years. I buy her every year for Christmas or birthday. She wanted the actual pencil for most of those years. But then when I couldn't find, I bought her this one. She actually likes it better cause it's more smudge proof.",4
"My skin became extremely sensitive after years of using acids.  I needed to balance my skin by incorporating some gentle products into my routine.  These pads are a delight to use.  They prep my face for other products with 0 irritation, and feels cooling.",3
"My skin can be a bit dry and flaky, so I was excited to try out this essence. It definitely delivers on hydration, and it leaves my skin smooth and supple. My biggest gripe is that dispensing the product can be a pain. Very little product comes out at a time. The cotton pads initially seemed like a nice thing to include, but have turned out to be kind of a waste. I use my hands to gently pat the essence into my skin instead of using the cotton pads. I feel that less product is wasted using this method. Still, it's a great product and I'm grateful that it was provided to me for free for testing purposes.",2
"My skin feels and looks great after this. I live in a very dry climate similar to an airplane. Very cold, brutal wind and frigid temperatures. During the winter time I use this mask and it preps my skin the morning to cope with Canadian winter.\nIt smells AMAZING. However, that is also the drawback for anyone sensitive to smell. I will not repurchase as I'm looking for fragrance free alternatives but this made me feel so lux putting it on haha",4
my skin feels nice and fresh after using this mist. it's nice to know that it's doing something for me about the blue light since I'm always on my phone. I like the scent that it has and although my skin is more on the oily side I still love it. I keep it in my back pack most my face whenever I feel I need it through out the day.,1
"My skin has been breaking out for the past 6 months, not sure why. Most of the products I have tried have either irritated my skin or did nothing. I bought this upon the recommendation from TheGlamTwins on YouTube, and I am so glad I did. It has helped my breakouts tremendously. I am seeing a lot of progress. Keep in mind, though, that I also had to change up the rest of my products as well, but overall this IS a great product. A little goes a long way so I know for sure that this product will last a good few months.",1
"My skin has more personalities than James McAvoy's character in Split: dryness, oiliness, flaking, acne, aging, scars. But to my surprise, this didn't make me break out or make my face an oil slick. I wear it day and night, even under makeup. I think I'm in love.",4
"My skin is combination toward oily side. Large pores, redness, and hormon pimples. I was skeptical to try out this one due to costly price. But for some random reasons, I decided to purchase this and give it a try. First time notice, it is just watery form of essence, absorb fast to face or may be to my palms. Has little hint of alcohol or kind of fermented rice water scent (imagining you put regular water in a bottle and left it for couple days, when you open it then it gives you that kind of scent). After 5-10 seconds slap it on, I have tingling feel on my skin. So i thought the product might start doing its job. After 3 days, my skin was dry and patchy all over. The feeling that you are about to have skin allergy. But i still give it another chance, twice a day. After 5 days, i got break out on my foreheas, my chin, and little white pumps all over my cheaks. the feeling when all of your ""ingrown"" pimples now has it chance to grow, so they are everwhere. My husband even asked what did i do to my skin and why it looked so bad. I was freak out! I went online to search for this reaction and SKII does claim that this is ""skin purging"" stage. So i trust the site again and keep using it. After 10 days, miracal happened. All the whiteheads and dry patches were gone. My skin is subble and brighter than ever. I never have this feeling before. It glows and crystal clear. Pores are diminished. Skin texture improved and feel amazingly smooth. Now instead of slap the product to my face, i put it in spay bottle and spray over. Love the feelings, love the result...!",4
"My skin is dry as dirt and this foundation works so well on it! I also haven't had any break outs from the foundation, and it applies and blends in perfectly with a beauty spongue. Definitely don't recommend trying to apply it with a foundation brush, go for the sponge!!! It really does hydrate, prevents that cakey look, and you are gauranteed to find your shade!",4
My skin is highly reactive and takes a long time for redness to subside and I have found this product to be it's saving grace. I didn't believe an essence/toner could do anything for my skin until using this treatment lotion. I use it twice a day and have seen a great improvement in the time it takes for my skin to calm down and also at keeping redness at bay. It absorbs quickly and I have no problems with layering other products over it. It's a lightweight liquid that keeps my skin calm and hydrated and happy.,0
"My skin is oily and acne-prone, and I was hoping the ingredients such as rosehip and sea buckthorn oil would help to calm my hormonal acne. However, I found that my skin breaks out due to Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, a derivative of Coconut Oil. Since this is near the top of the ingredient list, I had to discontinue usage and will just use pure rosehip oil.",0
"My skin is oily with large pores and I live in a super warm climate but I've never gravitated to any facial products that contained any type of SPF (I know what you're thinking ""Girl you need SPF protection to keep your skin healthy and youthful"") because of my fear that it would leave my face feeling greasy and worse clog my pores. I have used this sample (Golden Honey W-068) for a week and this was my experience:\n• Full coverage\n• Non-greasy\n• Matte skin like finish\n\xa0• No settling into fine lines or enhanced appearence of textured areas\n• Didn't cake up when setting products were applied\n•It wore for 9.5 hrs with one touch-up at the 5 hr mark experienced some shine on the T-Zone but there was no tacky feel or separation \nOverall, I grade this foundation at a A- it definitely changed the way I felt about facial skincare that contained SPF. I definitely consider this foundation to be a new found favorite and will be purchasing a full size asap.\n\n*Received this complimentary sample for testing purposes but all opinions are my own*",1
"My skin is usually an oil slick by the 4th hour, no matter what formula foundation I use. My go to foundations are either MAC Studio Fix powder, Hourglass Veil, or MAC Water weight. I was using TATCHA primer and my foundation looked beautiful  for about 2 hours and that was about it. I was able to get a sample in my VIB rewards and was blown away. I am at hour 4 and my foundation looks as fresh as it did when I put it on this morning. i am going to buy the full size.",0
"My skin is very dry, but acne prone. I never use this as a full face mask, as it is drying to the skin, and moisturize after any use. My favorite thing to use this for is blackheads, especially on my nose. I cover the end of my nose (or other small congested areas) with this mask, do the 20ish mins, and when I take it off my pores are cleared out better than anything else I've used (including strips and other peel offs). Doing this usually keeps my pores pretty cleared out for a week or longer. \nClearing congested pores helps, but my skin still has occasional breakouts, mostly in other areas where I wouldn't use it that way (due to dryness). So, I've also used this mask as a spot treatment. As far as spot treatments go, it helps, but it's nothing miraculous.",0
"My skin is very prone to breakouts right now and in the cold weather, it is also extremely dry. I've been using this moisturizer for well over a year and I didn't realize until I decided to stop using it, that this was causing a lot of my acne. My dermotologist recommended that I use an oil-free moisturizer instead. As for the dryness, it didn't really work any magic for me. This product is not strong enough for dryness and the oil clogs pores easily.",4
"My skin is very sensitive, and any kind of exfoliator that I have used, always left my skin red and caused my rosacea to flare up. I wanted to find the right product that could keep my skin soft, but gently at the same time. Using this product, I have noticed the difference in my skin. It feels cleansed, but refreshed. I've had no issues with my rosacea flaring up as well!",4
"My skin loves this product, it has changed dramatically in such a short time. My large pores are noticeably smaller especially on my nose. I had a few red and also light brown spots on my face those are almost completely gone. On my cheeks I have a couple of deep acne scars which are now raised. My skin overall is looking smooth and it's glowing. It has never ever looked this good, I even like my skin without makeup!",2
"My skin tends to be dry and lately I have been experiencing issues with large, open pores with hard blackheads in them. I was looking for something to help with that, in addition to not stripping my skin. The smell is VERY herbal, but isn't entirely off-putting. It hasn't improved my skin any at all-I may even go as far to say it has made it worse, and am now experiencing itchiness all over with excess oil production. That aside, the amount of product for the price is a good value, should it be something that works for someone else. I won't be finishing the bottle or repurchasing.",0
"my skin used to be so unbalanced and oily. As if nothing could stop the breakouts, my makeup would slide off my face no matter what primer I used. Then I bought the skincare kit with everything in this line and my skin completely changed. No more cystic acne, my skin texture is so soft and balanced, makeup in place, things healing well enough I go to work without makeup on pretty often!",1
My skin went from oily to extremely dry within a couple years. I'm currently 29 and struggle with skin so dry it feels really tight and has scaly patches. This is the best toner for dry skinned ladies. It feels so soothing upon contact and significantly amps the moisturizing power of my skincare routine. Also a soothing pleasant smell. Splash it on rather than using a cotton ball. Worth the money!,4
My very first step in both my AM and PM skin care routine. Very refreshing and soothing. Pairs so well with the rest of the Cicapair products. Perfect size to keep in my bag for a quick refresh on the go. I received this product for testing purposes but will be purchasing for sure!,4
"My whole life I have had trouble with peeling and cracked lips and I feel I tried everything to help. \nFinally I found this and it works! It does go on thick and tacky but good, it stays put and helps heal my poor lips. They have never felt better.",0
"N315 Le Rouge is a beautiful color. Just the right mix. Not too bright of a pink and not really purple. This formula was worn with Givenchy Interdit Made to Measure Pink and the two of them together lasted three to four hours before I ate. The formula is amazing with easy application and a lot of moisture. The tube on this one is very pretty with the flowers but the leather on this one feels much thinner, like paper. If the color N315 weren't so beautiful I would have given four stars because I was expecting the same leather as the others I have.",3
"Naked Honey, in my opinion, is closer to the shades I loved from the original Naked palette and therefore scratches the itch for me in that beloved way. Multitudes of color combos, I love the monochrome and the trendy mustard/ochre shades. This palette is an awesome blend of original and new plus I love the honey theme which is iconic and super meaningful to the brand.",1
Natural coverage and finish. I apply this with a flat top brush and it applies beautifully. I dislike the sponge it comes with it's too rough. It looks a little powdery at first but after a few minutes it settles and looks amazing. I find this lasts a bit longer than other powder foundations.,2
"Needed a new gold and saw this palette. It's ok, the colors go on smoothly and I like the variety .I wouldn't purchase again but if some of the colors were released individually I would continue buying them.",0
Needles No More is a product I use everyday! I love the pink hue which does wonders in blending with my skin. I place a small amount on my fingers and rub together and tap under my eyes and any other area where I see fine lines. The cream can be used under your makeup but I like to apply all my makeup and then Lightly tap this cream in the areas I want to look refreshed and wrinkle free! This product is always in my makeup bag! I love it!!!,3
"Never thought of using a brush to apply and blend concealer, even less on the eyes. I've always used my fingers or a sponge. This brush allows me to have an equal if not an even better coverage, application and blend because it doesn't absorb much product. It's a great tool for spot concealing too.",1
"new formula is terrible. bring back the original formula!! I adored the original formula. it worked perfectly, removed makeup, made my rosacea prone skin clear up and glow. I used 2x per week since it came out. this new stuff is a mess. it burned my skin, turned it bright red, smells odd, foams up, and didn't remove makeup. I wear very light makeup, rarely any foundation due to rosacea.  this new stuff caused a massive rosacea flare up. it's been over a week and my face is still red. it's the only change in my routine. this stink on many levels.",2
"Nice and creamy concealer. I personally found that it works best with fingers or a brush rather than a sponge. The color was really yellow on me rather than neutral. I got this from Influenster to review it. I would recommend trying it out in store before purchasing, but I definitely like it.",4
Nice color for me overall in the violine but there really is not enough contrast between the liner part and the color. It goes on as one color so nothing special. And trying to line the bottom lip is awkward as you have to turn the tube upside down to try and achieve the effect.,3
"Nice colors and nice palette. However - there is a terrible odor. It's touted as ""birthday cake"" - but it smells like crayons and chemicals - really awful - and really strong - and nauseating. Not sure what to do with it. I love the colors and shadows, but I'm having trouble dealing with this odor. Am thinking of returning it for this reason.",2
"Nice concealer that does not irritate my sensitive eye area at all.  Gives decent, medium coverage.  I would recommend going to a store and getting a shade match as there are not many shades and the one I would have picked online was definitely not the match for me.  The store person got it right though.  This does settle a bit into lines under the eye but a little bit of setting powder does the trick.  I have mature dry skin and this is working well for me.  It is light to medium in coverage overall so I may still need a stick or cream concealer for some more coverage on difficult areas.  I use a foundation over this before the setting powder to get a good under-eye look.",3
"Nice for some quick color (cheeks, lips, eyes). I wish it wasn't quite so matte, but I add a little gloss over the lips. Blends pretty easily. A tiny bit darker than I like for summer. Glad I finally tried it; it's been in my favorites list for ages.",3
"Nice hydrating moisturizer. Feels cool and rich going on and perfect for cleansers and toners that leave you feeling a lil dry. I gave it 4 stars because of size. I would /will buy again, the only reason I didn't immediately is because I wanted to try another brand someone suggested, but I highly recommend!",2
"Nice lipgloss, it isn't too sticky, and it lasts a while..now, I expected more color, my lips are rather pigmented so it looks like my lips with shine..I wish there would have been more color pay off..now, it is nice, and not too expensive..but there are better lipglosses out there .,the brand suffers from a bit of hype in a way.",3
"Nice natural finish foundation that is buildable to full coverage and easy to blend. It's not heavy or cakey. Great for normal, dry or combination skin types. It is transfer proof and sweat resistance. The color stays true. It's a bit pricey for me, but it is a good foundation.",2
"Nice quality mattes, but way too many similar colors (4 golds that look almost the same, matte shades are very similar in color and depth, the two deepest shades are very similar as well) and I still prefer the old shimmer formula which had more body, more oils to it, the new shimmer formula in the latest palettes just flakes and disappears very shortly after applying and doesn't give the same liquid metal, high shine impact like the old formula did in the 28 pan palettes and even in the first Sunrise palette. I feel like in persuit to improve the mattes (which were fine to begin with except for some dud shades), what made most people fall in love with the brand was lost, which were the shimmers.",1
Nice scent and colour.agteed with the earlier writer. :it cause me irritation and the scent alittle stronger day goes by. And I'm the bite avid user I loved most of their product except someshimmer and glitter ranges.i returned it,3
"Nice to know there are no animal products on my lips! Comes in a cute container, nice and glossy yet balmy at the same time, very moisturizing, I love to use it before bed and before I leave. It was -1 out today in dry MN and my lips did not feel dry at all!",0
"No I didn't. \nStill, I saw a couple great online reviews for this mini-duo and ordered it during the holiday sale. I have all of Fenty's glosses and this one is gorgeous--likely my new fave, so hopefully a full size will come out. \nThe highlighter is entirely unique too, it shifts almost lilac/silvery-taupe and in the inner corner of the eye it's striking, cheekbones too.",2
"No matter how many different mascaras I try, I always go back to this one. The Cadillac of mascaras. Doesn't clump, never looks like hairy spider legs, just natural healthy looking, long lashes. Worth it.",3
"No matter how much I wanted to love this as much as I love (most) other DE products... I just couldn't. Leaves such a tacky residue, strange smell (and I like scented products!), and occasionally/in some lights gives an obvious orange tinge to my face... I thought it was just me, but happened to my friend as well. There are other, better, formulations of Vitamin C serums!!",1
"No more disappearing shadow, no more eyeliner transferring, no more creasing!! I even use a dab on my nose where my eyeglasses rest and it helps keep my foundation from rubbing off. I have long, 14 hour days and sometimes I hate to remove my makeup at night, it still looks so good haha",3
None of my cleansers were working and I found out that I needed something stronger but I was nervous and didn't want something that would strip my face. A sephora rep recommended this and I haven't looked back ever since. it's so good and I wish that I had discovered it sooner!,1
"Nope.... just nope nope nope. I really wanted to like this. But I can't. The shade was okay, even though it did oxidize throughout the day. However, this settled into every single pore and crease!!!!! Pores and creases I didn't even know I had! And this was all within an hour of wear! I do have oily skin, but this was a bit ridiculous, not to mention how little coverage there was...... And I typically wear a BB or CC cream as my foundation, so I like light coverage...",1
"No powder setting needed!!! I use this concealer as foundation. I think I may have gotten a lighter shade, but it works just fine. I have oily skin but I am a little dry around the mouth and chin, so the concealer creases there. Everywhere it is perfect! What I love the most is that I do not have to set it with powder. It does not transfer!!! I am in awe of the finish. It is luminous.",4
No question it really is FULL coverage!  As others have said it is prone to transferring and can unevenly if you have combo skin.  Some things that help.  Mix the foundation on the back of your hand with a little primer then apply with a brush.  For evenings I mix a tiny drop of liquid highlighter.  \nPowder down the T zone and your are good to go!,2
"No redness, irritation or other reaction on my sensitive skin, but really no noticeable difference at all. Consistency of the product is quite runny as well. Bought it as part of the Herbivore set so it was about the size of a deluxe sample. I would have been very disappointed if I had bought the full size product based on reviews and had to return. I love the Herbivore Phoenix Oil and the facial spray is okay, but this product and the moisturizer just didnt work with my skin.",2
"Normally I love this brand, but I wasn't impressed with The Good Brow. The actual brow pencil part was fine, but definitely not enough of it for the price. The highlighter end didn't really do much of anything. Save your money",2
"Not a fan of this product. It doesn't blend well on the skin, leaving the under eye with streaks of a peachy-pink color. The ""brightening"" aspect is more light-reflective and leaves a pearlescent finish which I do not care for. I noticed also that the product would pill around the outer corners of my eyes, especially when I used a primer for my makeup. I feel like an eye specific SPF is unnecessary considering they make ones for the entire face and that the other claims of this product were unfounded.",0
"Not as expected. The dispensing end is removal thus it can easily come loose. Powder continuously spill out on the side of the brush head, making it look super messy at times. So for the price, it fails to deliver a good user experience. As for the  actual sunscreen protection, I can only guess that it works. Havent been burn while wearing it, although I still stay out of the sun when wearing it so honestly, who knows.",0
Not a Sunday Riley employee LOL. This stuff works very well. I have age related (in my 40s) hormonal pimples on my forehead & use this at night when they start to break out. The next morning I swear they are gone. It's not fixing the inherent problem but for now is saving me a trip to the dermatologist.,2
"Not a true wine, more of a pinkish brown.  Still, I like the color — that’s not the issue.  This is so drying for your lips!  Also not very richly pigmented for a matte lipstick.  Color is rather thin.",3
"not bad, but not worth the price. overall, the colors on the right side of the palette do not perform well, but I like several of the shades on the left side. the shimmers just dont really stick and dont show up well, but the mattes are nice. melt does well with darker colors but the lighter shades just dont do it for me. $65 is a lot, and for only half the shades to really perform its disappointing.  I love the greens and the burgandy shade. also the palette is very bulky.",0
"not for everyone..but this recommendation is my life saver.\neyebrow photo oct 18th vs collage august 19th\nnothing was helping my flared up skin. it was the worst it had ever been. stress being the biggest issue and then I starter having eczema acne break outs, extra oil and texture!\n\nincluding my neck..yes my neck i found it to be the worst and painful spot. embarassing!\n\nthis alongside salicylic acid\ncleared my congested, oily ane prone and scared face within a month. If i forget to use my skin flares up. this calms it down and theres a giant difference!\n\ni use with fab cleaner and DE birthday gift cream. i will be switching my entire skin care to the ordinary in hopes for a inexpensive new skincare journey!\n\nI'm also buying the ordinary an xmas gift for my siblings black head issue. They are struggling with their nose...I'll try and leave feed back once that is under control!",0
"Not for sensitive oily skin. It clogs up my pores and causes break outs the next day. I hardly touch this anymore. Great coverage for when I'm not breaking out and covering discoloration from previous blemishes. I take breaks between using this. It stays on for a good amount of time. I don't recommend when outside, it smears. Doesn't stay on. I haven't had it for a year. I want to give this 2 stars, I'm sure it'll work for someone else!",0
"Not gonna lie, the color was extremely intimidating but after a few trial and error (mainly trying to adjust to being more light-handed), this is a wonderful 3 in 1 product. I liked this best on my cheeks because I have more space to blend in case I accidentally apply too much. For my lips, I would tap in the product and ""blend"" by gliding on a gloss. It gave my lips a slight pop of color without being too intense. As an eyeshadow, I enjoy wearing this alone, but pairing it with gold eyeshadow, it can really glam up a look ;)",0
"not good for dry skin! I gave it to my friend who is more oily cuz I just couldnt get enough miniaturization out of it. plus I did not like the packaging for it, when you rub it on, it pulls at your skin!",4
"Not good. Says to use 2-3 drops but that's not enough to cover your face. I decided to tan my face on its own and do my body the next day. I used 6 drops on my face and then my fresh black tea moisturizer. When I woke up there was ZERO color or my face, and I'm pretty pale. Very disappointed.",1
nothing amazing similar to nudestix- hard to blend- dries quickly and doesn't last that long.  much better staying power when used as a liner- unfortunately i don't want any sparkle in my liner so i am returning,2
"Nothing special here, when you push your lips together to make the glitter come out it just makes your lips look dry and removes product, when you put more on it covers up the glitter and you go through an endless cycle.",0
"Not impressed, this is probably the worst palette she's done recently. I used the shimmers with my fingers and it was not as pigmented and it felt like I've had the palette for years and difficult to get any eye-shadow. I was worried that I may have a defective palette. For the price I shouldn't have to work so hard to get some payoff. I will return......... Maybe she's finally decided to with a cheaper quality.",1
"Not pigmented. I need to use a lot for it to show up at all. By then, my foundation is totally smudged around. Very firmly pressed and dry powder. Notice how most of the positive reviews are from fair-skinned people. I would recommend the Too Faced Chocolate Soleil bronzer and the ABH bronzer over this.",0
"Not sure about the fine lines, but I've purchased this product a few tines already. Clears my skin completely and my pores are significantly less noticeable. I use less makeup because it makes my skin smoother. Not much else to say, I love it!",4
"Not sure if this was worth it... thought this would be a great kit to try some products but most were a bust.  The kit gets 3 stars because I love the Charlotte Tillbury - flattering color and this was the highlight of the set - and I use the laniege so it was worth the price, but unfortunately the milk lipbalm broke during my first use, the fresh balm - which I use in full size all the time - was so small it was used up in a week, the roller on the INC product was stuck so i couldn't get any product and the too faced was too dark.",3
not sure what all the hype is about- just a small eyeshadow palette- found the colors to be muddy on my nc30 skin- may be better for lighter skin tones.  this was my first Natasha denona palette- the quality is the same as lots of other palettes i have.  maybe another color theme will work better on me.- sadly i returned it.,2
"Not sure why but I've used this oil for almost a year. It smells heavenly but I do not see any dramatic changes in my skin other than my skin getting duller and darker. When I stopped using it, my skin miraculously brightened and glowed.",3
"Not sure why everyone is complaining about these not being self sharpening.  I have these in several colors, all are very smooth and pigmented.  Love the bright blue for the water line, it doesn't smudging at all!!",1
"not sure why people are so hyped about this :( its not blackest black, it will smudge if you have hooded eyes and does goes patch if you trying to make it blacker. there are way better liners for doubles less...",1
"NOT THE DESCRIBED COLOR AT ALL!! This is a gold glitter charcoal. C'Mon ABH, you can do better than this!! I am a fan of your stunning, easy to blend shadows. Those look great on elderly skin, no crepy look!",4
"not too powerful of a smell, my skin and lips feel well hydrated at night regardless of occasionally breathing through my mouth. only used 2 days but my chapped lips are much better (this at night and dior lipgloss during the day) has been amazing! the face cream is light and moisturizing",0
Not very pigmented. There's drug store brands that are much more pigmented and less expensive. I bought the smaller palette exchanging it for this one but regret it. Will be returning. Note that I am using a eye shadow primer.,1
"Not what it claims, at least not for me. I have pretty dry skin and as much as I wanted to love it, I couldn't. It removes makeup very very well, I'll give it that. But being an oil cleanser I expected it to be hydrating, it cleanses well, almost too well that skin is left tight very dry and uncomfortable. Causes some burning/tingling sensation as well.",4
Not worth 300$$ Its not a bad serum but it's not worth $300. Countless hyaluronic serums will do the same job as this one for a fraction of the price. I finished the entire bottle of this serum and started using my Mizon hyaluronic serum and my skin didn't skip a beat. I see no difference.  Spend your money on something else.,4
Not worth the price. I used this product daily for more than 6 weeks and saw no visible benefit. There are so many serums available for less money that do just as well or better. Very cumbersome to get the last of the product out of the jar. Pump is useless after about 3/4 empty.,3
"Obsessed doesn't quite capture how much I love this bronzer and blush duo. I wear them every day, but love that they're buildable for special occasions. The glow they give my fair skin is so pretty and I love how well it photographs!",0
"OBSESSED. My skin is so much more clear, even, brighter and tighter! It is very potent. Not for skin care newbies, and not for someone who's skin isn't used to being treated with acids. It will burn on open skin! This is 100% a new staple in my routine.",1
Obsessed with every summer Friday’s product. But this is a holy grail item. Makes my skin glow so soft. I have sensitive skin and use all of their products with no reaction. Cc me used with jet lag mask is the ultimate!!!  Oh and the smell is absolutely incredible!!! Buy this product you will not regret it!!!,0
"obviously I was heart broken by the news that bite was reformulating but took this set as a chance to try the new things and fall back on an old faithful if need be. \nthe night time lip therapy smells like creamy citrus, not my favorite but I thought I'd be able to over look it. it applies smooth, but the smell changes from the odd creamy lemon to an off, almost Vaseline like smell. It makes my lips peel, and sucked the life out of them. i definitely feel drier now than before. \nthe lip balm is a waste of time. you can't keep it near any source of warmth. it's winter in Canada and it melted in my office. it won't last in your pocket, carry it farrrr away from your body. Beside the melting point being approximately 7*C, it has also made my lips incredibly dry after a few uses. maybe my lips haven't recovered from the overnight therapy yet, but this is certainly not fixing that problem.\nthe lip mask is the old faithful and only saving grace of this set. I discovered it a few years ago and it's been all I've been using since (even with the hefty price tag). It's thick enough that it stays for hours without reapplying. I've never had any issues whatsoever with the lip mask. I'm very disappointed that bite will be discontinuing this line. Maybe they should have started a vegan line and given their customers a choice instead of throwing their good formula away for this horrid vegan version.",1
"Of all of the cleansers I've tried, this one is my favourite by far. I have sensitive combination skin that is prone to breakouts so I need something that is gentle but also deep cleaning - this product does just that. This cleanser truly exfoliates my skin without stripping it of it's natural oils. I love how clean, smooth, and hydrated my skin feels after using this product.",0
"Of all the concealers I've used, and I've used tons, this is the absolute best. It covers, never creases, moves and blends really well and I don't need a lot.  I've had my tube for months and I'm finally opening up a new one. This is great for women over 50. The best! Well worth the $$$.",3
"Of course, it's good. Charlotte Tilbury knows how to make eyeshadow. It's a soft, feminine look and it lasts all day without touch ups. I love the look, I just wish the midtone shimmer was softer. I realize that it's a topper, but you really do have to use a lot to get it to show. That said, it really is a peerless daytime look.",3
Oh dear .... this baby is overrated and overpriced. Come on $38 for this wax colour. Horrible !!! bite beauty with quality ingredients cost only $30. This has Avery light color not moisturising at all even with balm.Many brand has better formula than this one in this price range. Anyway money goes in the drain. Worst in BB website it claim VEGAN ....OMG..totally fake.,3
"oh emm gee!! this tiny little thing is deadass voodoo.. I was a dedicated Kat Von D contour user, someone gave me a gift card and decided to try this out.  at first i was disappointed seeing how tiny it was for $44 but that was MONTHS ago and i still haven't hit pan YET - I contour every day.  a little goes a long way, I dont even have to use much, I can even skip a step and not blend because this just blends itself while applying .. I swear there is some voodoo magic ingredient in this little thing.",2
Oh how I loved this. It felt so nice and smelled so good. A great makeup remover but unfortunately for me I had a reaction to one of the ingredients bc my eyes were insanely itchy after each use. I was very disappointed =(,4
"OH MY GAWD, YOU GUYS -- this cleanser is UH-mazing!!!! \n\nI don't usually believe all the hype around the upscale cleansers; in my experience, they never work any better than Aveeno or any of the other drug store face cleansers, but they charge three times as much. However, being a skincare junkie, I really wanted to up my cleanser game, so when I saw a) how amazing the reviews for this were, and b) that it included rice in its formulation, I just had to give it a shot. \n\nHaving used Tatcha's rice enzyme powder, I am familiar with the amazing effect rice has on your skin. This cleanser is no different. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, soft as a baby's bottom, and oddly exfoliated, even though there are no microbeads or harsh chemicals. The oil is delightful and yet powerful. My skin feels totally clean but also moisturized, unlike most cleansers, which leave my skin feeling stripped of moisture.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, the BEST cleanser I have ever used. I am so in love!!!! At $29, it's a steal, imho. Run, don't walk. This ish is legit!",2
"oh my god, I have the driest skin ever and this helps so much. My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth and I've gotten so many compliments on how good my skin looks. AMAZING!! not sure why this isn't more popular! I don't usually write reviews but this product is just too good.",0
"Oh my god. My face was so smooth before I started using this product. Not only do I still have my eyebags but now I have small red bumps under my eyes. Don't use this if you have sensitive skin, I just wanna cry. Before and after pics shown after 1 morning and night usage. Saw this at work this morning.",0
"oh my goodness I swear if Sephora ever stops making this I will cry and they had better give me plenty of notice to stock up. I have slimmed my morning and evening routine down to This lotion, tarte cleansing gel, and after a heavy makeup day Tarte frixxion stick. Together OMG I'm the happiest I've been since grade 4 before my face started acting wack.when I first got this as a sample I loved it, then had to buy full size. I have had severe cystic acne forever and I'm 30 now. this lotion dried out my face at first, but as it was drying it out my acne vanished. The tarte cleanser is also moisturizing so the two of them work 100% for my skin. Even my boyfriend who's hand touched my face, said wow your face is so soft and you dont even have any acne anymore.",1
"Oh my gosh, best box ever for ten bucks! Really, worth $60 so I am in heaven with this one. Love all these brands, Living Proof is my fave hair line. Never disappoints. Bite lip products are the best. Kiehl's products are always spot on fantastic! Love the Solid beauty cleanser. They last forever! The bonus perfume is really nice and light. Dr. Dennis skincare is always a bonus. I am so happy to try this! Winning box by Sephora! Plus, so worth the ten bucks.",3
"OH MY GOSH! I finally got this set and now it comes with a free mascara and eye liner. SCORE! I got for my birthday which is Dec. 31st. I have been wanting this chocolate palette forever!!!! I am so excited that now I can't wait to try it out. Read all the fantastic reviews on it. The colors look divine. Perfect for my hazel eyes. Plus, Too Faced is one of my fave brands. Love, love, love!",3
"Oh my gosh, this is the best eye brow powder ever! I selected one that matches my hair color perfectly. I mean my brows look like they did when I was a teenager. They are thick, pigmented, full and so natural looking now. My eyebrows are turning grey since I am 58 now. This will make your brows look like they did when you were young, guaranteed! Buy this, you will love it!",3
"Oh my gosh, this set is a steal! The brow brush alone is $24.00 and then you get the other 3 items for $4.00! What? That's crazy! Love Benefit's brow brush after using the sample I received in a Sephora Play box. I had to buy the full size! I pounced on this deal when I saw it online. Highly recommend all these products!",3
"Oh wow! These are some amazing primers! I believe there is a total of five different primers that just released.  They are all so wonderful! I really adore this blurring one and the protection one for different days! The blurring one is so smooth and it really makes the skin look more flawless on it's own.  This one has a more thicker consistency than the others, but it sinks into the skin wonderfully still.  It is not drying at all, it's still very gentle and good to the skin.  This is also a lot of product in here as well.  This also is ok to use on sensitive skins and on acne-prone skins.  This really makes foundation wear nicer and it makes it stay in place better.  I definitely recommend picking up at least one of these primers from Laura Mercier.  (I will use the protection one on days I want a more dewy look or if I'm going little to no makeup).",0
Oh wow! This is by far the best lip mask out there! It blows Laneige and Bite Beauty lip masks out of the water! This is definitely the most hydrating mask of them all and it really does plump the lips up too! It also has the cutest packaging in my opinion.  This is a slightly more gel like consistency which makes it much more smoother than the other lip masks.  I just bought four so I can always have a back up because these don't come out very often.  I highly recommend getting this!,0
"Okay but not impressed. I guess you can't complain too much for price. The packaging is awful & the pans are tiny. I didn't really care much for how any of the shadows performed with or without brush. I used the Sephora Give me glitter silicone set & it didn't work well with them either. They didn't perform much better with finger application.  I think I'll stick to my less expensive prestige brands from now on. This brand just isn't worth it to me. Especially not this ""palette"".",3
"okay, I'll start by saying that I'm not sure how this is a $137 value, it's a smaller palette. however, the shades are really beautiful. the mattes blend out nicely and the shimmers can be applied with a brush or with the fingertip for a bigger impact. it's easy to take your look from day to night using just this palette. my personal preference would be for maybe one more matte over a shimmer, but for the price and quality it's worth it.",1
"Okay ! Please ! Colours average, formula alittle drier than regular AB lipstick. Offcourse packaging is cute and vegan . Hope to see more colour in regular tube. Uninteresting shades. Sorry bite ! Failed",3
"okay so colour, gorgeous but I find it wipes off way too easily for a liquid lip, it does not dry off at all. It only takes one wipe of a tissue and it is gone. The matte lip I find is a bit too thin, and yet I feel it on my lips all day. I am torn cause I love the colour and the package but the formula is a meh for me. The lip liner tho I really liked, it does not deposite colour on the first swipe too well but I like being able to go over a few times.",0
okay so I am NOT a fan of mists of face sprays so I really had to get the courage to use this. I was surprised to feel so refreshed and that it did calm the redness on my face a little. I did like to use it in combo with other ciciapair products AND I loved it alone as well. this is going to become a staple for me. I did receive this product complimentary for purposes of product testing.,1
"Okay, so i have been using this makeup for 2 days now, and this product is an absolute GAME CHANGER. If you're like me and suffer from severe acne, but can't wear that one foundation you love because you spent that money and really wanted to buy it for the name, AND because it will make your acne worse, then worry no longer because this baby is here to the rescue(literally.) My acne has gone down severely, my skin is even smoother and i don't have anymore build up in my pores from oil, makeup and debris from pollution. Even some of my acne scars have lightened up. I was iffy about buying because I'm so use to using Fenty and (ugh) morphe foundation, but trust me, this powder covers so elegantly, that your friends and coworkers wont even realize you have foundation on(unless your wearing eyeshadow and highlighter) also the best part? this is the first product I've worn that hasn't melted off my oily nose by the end of the work day. TOTALLY worth it, and if you're gonna buy this product, might as well take it all the way and buy the Charcoal Anti-bacterial kabuki brush with it. Your skin will thank you!!!!!",4
"Okay, so I’ve only posted two maybe three reviews, but THIS ISH RIGHT HERE!!!! So, when I’m getting ready to choose a color it’s always a discussion between me and myself. I just CANNOT CHOOSE!  Really it doesn’t matter what color you choose, the PIGMENT, the PIGMENT, the PIGMENT!  I have no words but BUY IT YOU WON’T BE DISAPPOINTED!",2
"Okay, so I will tell you I have combo, dehydrated oily T Zone 35 yr ol acne prone skin.  it's important to know what kinda look ur expecting from this spray.  I was personally not looking for Matte.  I HATE MATTE.  I think it looks so unatural.  so I wanted a spray to atlas control my oil and this does it for me and more.  when I spray over my radiant satin makeup look, I look more lush, fresh and dewy.  it also makes me feel more awake and sexier which is then portrayed on my facial expression.  I spray over makeup and I don't end up an ugly oily mess mid day but dewy , but us till need to blot.  so there is a difference in oil control.  I also spray this after a workout and it cools me down, but somehow make me look more prettier.....don't ask me how but the proof are in the googly eyes I get from men.  maybe it provides me with youthful glow.....who knows?  but I don't wear it every day and I can see this wasting fast.  it never broke me out and I am willing to get one on an annual basis.",4
"okay so this girl is thick, youre gonna feel it on your face for the first couple minutes but then it really does sink into your skin. my skin has been ultra sensitive lately in addition to the winter dryness, most heavy moisturizers sting/cause irritation, but this one is seriously gentle and effective",4
"Okay, so you cannot shrink the size of your pores. Anyone who says their pores ""shrunk"" are only seeing an improved appearance because this product is helping to keep them clear and therefore making them temporarily look like they are smaller. This is not a permanent thing and your pores will always be the size they are no matter what you do. Its genetic. Period. I don't believe this product makes the claim it can shrink pores, but it does claim to help rid them of the gunk that clogs them which in turn will make your skin look better. I have been using this daily for 3 weeks and the pores around my nose which is my problem area, are just as clogged as ever. The serum does feel nice on and works more like a high end primer under makeup for me. I use many products from Dr. G. including the face wash, and I love those, but this serum I am not thrilled with so far. I will use up the bottle, but I can't see repurchasing it again unless some miracle happens. That's okay though. Not every product will work for everyone. Glad to hear that others have seen nice results though.",3
"okay. this is the 3rd tatcha product I've tried and once again, it broke me out. I've come to realize that my skin just doesnt like tatcha. it is a shame because the packaging is so beautiful and elegant on all of their products.",4
"Okay, this product is great considering that it is ""winter"" over here on the Carolina coast, and the weather goes from 70° to °40 within a day. I would only use this product very, and I mean very sparingly if my skin is drying and flaking (on a winter day). I'm not a big fan of honey, both smell and tasre personally, but I can get over that, because dang - this product ain't playing when it comes to hydration. I made mistake of putting a pinky size amount on my hand, thinking that wouldn't be enough for my face. Yeah, it was enough for my face, neck hands, and part of my arms. I looked like I could glow in the dark I was shining so bright after putting that on (I was at the end of doing a full Korean skin care routine - mask and all).\n\nWhy is it 4 stars? \nA great product that will last me till I die for how little I use, but the tube it is in is very hard to get product out. Also, the product itself feels heavy on my face, like I know there is something on my face. A little bit too sticky and thick, but I mean it's honey, so that's not too big of a shocker. I would give this product 4 1/2 stars, but I can't.",4
"Okay usually I'm not about smells when it comes to my skin care but this one has such a wonderful smell. Now to the actual product, I love how this literally melts into my skin. I questioned this pressed serum idea but this is one of my favorites. I use it each night and it does what I need it to do, keep me young!",3
"ok dont know why people are saying they feel the plumpness. to me it feels like I just put blistex on my lips...that's it. now I always have chapped lips no matter what I do or how much water I drink I'm still chapped but this has hydrated my lips some. personally I would buy this again just because I like how it feels on my lips. a little tip tho: when you twist once, it's usually too much that comes out so if you do a half of a twist, let a little come out then let it go..dont do a full twist.. it's much better to do it that way.",1
"ok first of all I've been using clinique since my early 20s bc of their 3cstep skin care system for acne.., I'm 38 now and no longer have that issue. I have not used clinique products in about 10 yrs. I had  recently seriously overdone it w retinol and an acid peeling solution from different brands. I literally burnt my skin in places especially around my eyes. after using my face wash I just wanted a gentle moisturizer that would not further irritate my skin. I got the moisture surge in my play box and decided to try it or the ren for sensitive skin. tried ren first and immediately had to wash it off bc of the burning. rehashed my face and applied the moisture surge. NO burning!! not one bit! and its a light feel not smothering! makes me remember why I love clinique!",2
"ok. I did not go into this with high expectations. I did not like the regular born this way foundation, I am partial to the concealer, and lately I have been trying to go more minimalist with my face makeup. I have had bad luck before with powder foundations and have been decluttering the ones that work poorly for me--my old KVD one and an IT powder were just tossed. I only bought this because it was on sale and the reviews looked promising. ok. my review.  My skin has NEVER looked better. I pair this with the new smashbox concealer (use this first) and praise be the makeup gods make me an angel! my skin looks soft and smooth, flawless, and lasts all day long (I have oily skin so this is HUGE). I recently uses this combo for my engagement photos and I felt so confident and pretty. I'm guessing if there was a big sale then it must be going away, but I'm crossing my fingers that's not true.",4
"Ok, I've only tried a few eye patches but these are the best... so far. They're really cute- who doesn't like watermelon?!! More importantly they stay in place!!!! You can run around or lie down... do other tasks and they don't move. I've tried other patches where even while lying down they're sliding alllll over the place! So annoying!! Anyway, these helped with puffiness but my only 1 star deduction was for quantity. 6 patches for $25 is just not cost effective. That's not even enough for 1 full week! If you can afford then definitely try them but I'm gonna keep searching because I can't justify spending the money.",2
"Ok, I waited until after a full month had passed of using this product, before I jumped on here and left a review. My skin CAN tend to dry out, especially if I have been in the sun. I found that using this toner in place of my typical toner, especially on those dryer feeling days, was a lifesaver for me! Nothing feels worse than stripping your face of any, and all, oils when you are already feeling particularly, dry. Thankfully, this product was exactly what I needed! It did NOT dry, or strip, my face, but instead left it feeling smooth, and hydrated! I plan on keeping a bottle handy, especially for after having been in the sun, or during those cold, dry, winter months! It's PERFECT! It says it's even good for those with combo or oily skin, too! -But I can only speak from my position of dry/combo, so I CAN tell u without a doubt, for dry skin, it is a FOR SURE, winner!!",2
"ok let's be real. The coverage, beautiful! The spreadability, awesome! and the finish, a tiny bit of shine and is natural. Those are the good things. I put this on and immediately it oxidized! My face was orange but definitely not as orange as my neck. I mean wow. I tried to over look it but it was really bad. And then I saw that it said it's water resistant or whatever, so after about half an hour of wearing, I decided I'll wash my face and see what happens. I washed my face and it got super cakey, I dab dried and alot came off but not all, it just went to light coverage. overall, I wouldn't buy this for $38, that's alot of money for a foundation that's gonna turn you orange. I do love the fact that it's cruelty free tho.",4
"Ok. Nothing WOW.  I have buying these lip sets for years.  This year's set is nothing exciting.  Other years have had more colors.\n\nIf you love Charlotte Tilsbury, you might be happy with the full sized lipstick.  Personally, I wasn't wowed by the shade.\n\nSince I bought this set, he price has been reduced.  For the current price, I give the set four stars.  At my original price, I give it three stars.",4
Ok products I guess. Its not enough to really say. what I was curious was the makeup cleansing balm and it not that good. It's hard to work with. I just think this is over price the only thing I like it's the package of the set. I used to storage some skincare,1
"ok Sephora, you did better this year by including actual makeup, but you also raised the price, and it's still not that great. you have a plethora of sephora branded products to put in this calendar.  there should be no repeats, and there should be less kitschy products. try again next year",3
"OK, so don't you love when you FINALLY find your shade of foundation and then company decides to just change the names/numbers on it? Here my (very short) rant: This product is really good, I mix 1-2 drops with my moisturizer and it's just enough coverage. Now, if you travel, the bottle becomes a mess. It leaks. It's a pain. I see now they changed the bottle, so I can't wait to see if this is better.\nNow - when it comes to shade, according to the chart, the previous N35 shade should be N Light 2. It's not. The suggested shade is way lighter. It took me 3 trips to a Sephora store to get 2 different samples every time, until i finally found the one that matches: it's N Medium 2. And it's a big difference. For my skin colour anyway.\nSo - yes, I recommend the product. I hope the new bottle is better. I also wish Sephora consultants should know about this chart (they don't) - I could have avoided 2 trips to the mall for 4 samples that I cannot use (= product waste too!).",2
Ok so yes the product arrives 20% empty but there has to be some reason for that. Honestly the company should address the issue in their description bc for $30 I know I was taken back by that. Buttt the product itself..WOW=) I'm pretty freaking happy!!! I've sprayed before bed the last 2 nights and day one you could actually see my bra straps that were on when I sprayed. I woke up with tan lines haha. Day two I mist have slept with my hand to my cheek bc a few of my fingers are in fact tan! I'm going to try spraying during the day b4 or after makeup not sure yet. All in all fantastic product I'm definitely in love. Low maintenance tan for face and upper body streak free and just beautiful.  Its smack dead mid winter an I could walk out with just my red lipstick today like a summer day!,4
"Ok. These are ridiculous. For starters I was blown away when I opened it, online stock photos do not do it justice. Also, the pigment is real. I sort of expected the mattes to be decent but actually they're amazing. Reminds me of Subculture without the crumbling. It's easily my new favourite palette. You must buy this.",2
OK. This fortunately is a make up palette marketed towards my light skin tone.  it's OK for make up to target specific skin tones because it's unrealistic to demand that every piece of make up work for every single skin tone. That's impossible and defeats the purpose of make up. \n\none size fits all is not at all possible and who would want that? Every skin tone has literally thousands and thousands of beautiful products to choose from.  I just can't believe it that societee dictates that any eyeshadow or especially complexion power it should be available for everyone.   It's a combination of ingredients that turns out to be one or the other. For light or 4 deep.  \n\nmake up on its face IS based on skin tone .    When a company is refining a particular palette it would ruin the palate to try to force it to be something else.  \n\nIf I recall last year their holiday palette was geared toward dark skin tones. As a matter of fact I know that to be true because I bought it and it's way way way way too dark for me.  \n\n I just sincerely hope that people actually rating a product less because it can't possibly work for everyone does not ruin the make up industry artistic endeavors and make great companies be afraid to release great creations.   With so many victims it makes it impossible for any company to release anything with out a group of people being angry.  No matter what there's going to be unhappy people literally no matter what they do.,3
"ok this is my first time ever writing a review on sephora even though I have been a valued customer for years. Now yes, it does smell like chlorine slightly during the initial spray but wow does this do wonders to my skin. I have had acne since middle school and now I'm in my mid 20s and I still struggle with hormonal and stress related bad breakouts. I tried everything and anything and wasted thousands on products (since middle school til now). Even was on accutane but guys... it may not totally prevent acne but when I use this, my acne definitely goes down by more than half for the cystic ones and nearly completely gone the next day for the small ones! it's so crazy and to be able to say my face glows the following morning?! I just want to say, I based off the few reviews on here when I decided to buy it. I have never ever heard of this brand but my goodness am I glad I tried! i spray this as a toner, after moisturizer, after makeup, after I wake up, etc. please please please do not ever discontinue this product!!! ok but one more thing to add, it's not exactly moisturizing on your skin so definitely make sure you put on a good moisturizer. other than that, if you're hesitating to buy this, I say just go for it! have a great day everyone!",4
"OMG! How stunning is this palette seriously. I was looking for some beautiful flashy shades, that would be super pigmented and I found the perfect match for a very decent price. I use Seafoam and Pearl for one of my looks and they worked so well.",4
"OMG! I have the lightest brown and it is by far the most FABULOUS brow filler I have ever found. Thank God I have a tendency to buy a few when I fall in love with a product. Why is Sephora discontinuing this? HELP! Does anyone know if there is a product similar? The dry powder, not the liquid (like they seemed to have replaced this with YUCK)?  I'm super mad at Sephora for doing away with their best product ever!",3
Omg I love the way it feels on my lips instantly moistures my lips!! But first use of it and it lip gloss broke in half it’s so delicate. Also the packaging is cardboard not a fan of that. This was a sample one. Will not be buying the full price one!,1
"OMG! I love this brow pencil.  I have no eye brows due to aging process plus having gone through chemo therapy for breast cancer.  This truly is universal.  I got the mini pencil for a 100 pt reward and love it so much I am going to buy the full size.  I rolled up the product quite a bit and there is a lot of it for a mini size, i rolled it back down though as i was afraid of rolling it out too much as i was worried it would break off or come out too much to roll it back down.  It didn't fortunately.  Yes highly recommend this, i have dark brown hair and this pencil is perfect color.",3
OMG I love this brush so much! Waiting for it to restock so I can buy a spare! This little jewel places my shadow exactly where my small eyes needs it and not all to the side where it makes my eyes look downturned with bad placement. Other brushes were very hard for me to get the look I’m going for. I love this brush!!,3
"OMG, I love this palette! I wasn't going to pick it up as I'm 57 and thought the shades might be a bit over the top for someone my age. Well if they are, you know what? I don't care, I love them! I made up one eye using all 4 colors! I created a smokey halo with the purple, put the blue in the center of the eye and the green on the rest with a pop of the gold in the corner and very sparingly on my brow. Honestly the blend was perfect, the color shift on the green is amazing and the colors didn't muddy into one another. My eye looked like a butterfly's wing. So beautiful. They are a bit much for work but next time I go out I will be rocking this palette for sure. Pat, you did it again!",3
Omg I LOVE this set! I have tried so many high end brands that cost twice as much and this stuff is amazing! I’ve been using it for a month now and I can say it’s made a difference in my skin. I love how it all feels! This is a good set to try out before buying the original size.,1
"OMG I love this! This is the first time I have purchased it and I was reluctant due to having bought expensive cleansers in the past for them to be a complete failure! This is the bomb! I wasn't sure about the application method but it works and the smell is divine. I have redness prone, mature skin and something had also caused me to break out. However a couple of days using this and my skin glows. It feels soft and hydrated too. I will definitely repurchase.",3
"OMG!! I rarely get pimples anymore with the occasional exception, and these have worked well for those. What I was unprepared for is how they absolutely suck all the gunk deep down in congested areas of my face, not how they have helped get rid of some milia I had on top of my cheekbone below my eye!! I take very good care of my skin, but have large pores that I attribute to aging, but again, when I put these on, the next day, the area where I wore them is poreless!! I need to purchase the strips instead of using these dots all over my face, but let me tell you - I will NEVER be without these again!! I can't believe my eyes!!",4
"OMG!!!!!.  It's a bomb! What a cream blush created by tower 28. Super creamy , silky soft and good color pay off.  Good pigmented too. It may look too bright on web page but it's light and beautiful after blending. I do own so many cream blush nothing like this, the only concern is not to good on lips cause I have a super sensitive lip. I have to go for clear one for lips. Good job tower 28 hop to see this brand grow.",3
"On 1st and subsequent uses, liner acts like there's no ink. The only time ink comes out is when you apply quite a bit of pressure on the eye surface. The tip is very dry. When what little ink does come out, it skips across making it very difficult to create a sharp cat eye. It is not smooth whatsoever. Will be returning the product. Highly caution purchasing this product. Definitely not worth the price!",3
"Once again, The Ordinary comes through.  This is such a great toner. It cleans away any reside from cleansing and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and balances.  No harsh scents left behind.  There's no need to spend a lot on an expensive toner when this does the job!  High recommend.",3
"Once again, The Ordinary gives this amazing Alpha Lipoic Acid , truly wonderful product! I have been using it on my body also ! mix a little with my   biidy lotion and it makes my skin so  beautiful!  My skin just loves this brand! My face is so very happy!",3
One essential must have is Sephora’s Collection Colorful Waterproof Eyeliner. The Sailor Kiss Matte Navy Blue is my new black go-to! It goes on smooth with a gentle touch and highlights the eyes just right. It withstands hours of outdoor workouts and looks just as good afterwards as it did going on. Don’t go anywhere without this little gem. Try it out soon!,3
"One of my absolute favorite mascaras! The formula is amazing!! It doesn't clump my lashes together or flake off throughout the day. I love the applicator because it grabs lashes and coats every lash. It's TRUE to its name, it actually fans out your lashes, giving the appearance of wearing false lashes!! Highly reccomend this mascara!",2
One of my CANT LIVE WITHOUT products!! I use this every night! I absolutely can't live without it!! Makes my skin look amazing!! It's a very easy essential step that makes any serum or cream work better! It also works great on its own!! Love,3
"One of my favorite eyebrow pencils. At first I thought, really universal....will not work......Yes, it does! I have very fair eyebrows that you barely noctice and this pencil is great. Great that you can purchase in a mini. I normally use Anasthasia Beverly Hills powder kit, but this is so convenient that I found myself grabbing for it today instead of my ABH and I was just at home, so that is saying a lot.",2
"One of my favorite primers.  I have dry skin and this primer leaves my face smooth, soft, and actually has a blurring effect.  Great for keeping foundation in place all day, really helps areas that have a bit of texture.",2
"One of my favorites. Always looks smooth and  clean on the skin, it's super easy to apply and sets really easily. It also doesn't feel heavy on my face. I love the packaging, it looks clean and doesn't break.",4
"one of my very favorite foundations of all times.. love the feel and look of it. I'm 35 with some fine lines, combo skin but dehydrated during Canadian winter. It feels like a moisturizer and feels very comfortable. My forehead gets shiny during the day (this happens with all the foundations including matte ones), but nothing a blotting cannot fix. My skin looks healthy, smooth and vibrant with it. Definelty recommend it.",2
"One of the beauty gurus that I follow has been raving about this primer.  She claims that it's a hybrid, helping smooth and nourish the skin and I'd have to agree.  My skin is dehydrated and dry so I need as much help as I can get.  The sheer pink color helps brighten my complexion just a touch, and it's so smooth.  I'll be repurchasing for sure.",1
"One of the best sheet masks that I've used. Perfect amount of hydrating,  non-sticky serum. With some sheet masks, my easily acne prone skin feels sticky and overwhelmed and I see new breakouts the next day- but none of that here. The next morning,  my skin was plump, soft and bright. \n\nApplication was a breeze too, with the gauze backing.  Unfolded and had it on my face in record time.\n\nI will be repurchasing.  Wish they had a discounted 10 pack.",2
"One of the strongest peels available at sephora and for a fraction of the price. I am honestly skeptical of the ordinary but I don't want to pay 90 dollars for a peel when I could get three medical grade peels for that price. This stuff burns my face for 3 minutes, while my friend who actually has more sensitive skin than me said she only felt a tingle. Doesn't give me any super wow results but I will at least use the whole bottle.",1
"One of the things that's been disappointing about the growth of brow products are the lack of redhead options. it's always, use a light brown, or ashy color.\n\nGingersnap is actually a good color if you have red hair (I have light/medium red hair so the browns or blondes just don't do it. This color is much, much better! \n\nThe ink side does take some practice to get used to but it's a nice fine tip.",2
One of the very best masks I've ever tried! It makes my skin feel so very clean and restored! I would recommend this to everyone in the world! Thank you Play! By Sephora team who put this in my June Play! Box!!! ☺,3
"One star for not stinging, burning or itching, for having colors pale enough that still look like skin, and for packaging that doesn't leak. However, it covers nothing. It literally disappears into my skin like there's nothing on it. Multiple layers, even with powder between, just vanish. It doesn't cover dark circles, hyperpigmentation, moles or blemishes. At all. Weirdly, after a couple hours, it does crease.",3
"One star Ladies, you have to keep using it.\xa0 I am now able to use it every other day and I use it with a BHA product.\xa0 For dryness I use either Marula or Plum oil.\xa0 When I first used it, my face hurt like a *&%$# but with time the pain and peeeeling became minimal.\xa0 The leaking tube was annoying. What I figured out is, hold it with the opening facing up and squeeze from the bottom stopped the oozing.\xa0 BUT just remember, YOU HAVE TO STICK WITH IT.",2
Only a small amount is needed for very comfortable lip moisturization. The texture initially feels like the smoothness of honey that warms and adheres to the lips sealing in the moisture for hours. It is now my favorite new lip balm. It smells like a cross between vanilla and Garnier Frutis shampoo which is pleasant. I love it!,3
"Only disappointment was they didn’t last a whole work day, even with Clinique eye primer underneath, leaving an uneven layer after a few hours. Despite that they are luxurious, beautiful colors, look great-I’ve found the right colors for brown skin",2
"only tried this for a few days and man, my skin puffed up under my eyes. made my skin itch. made my dry skin around my eyes even dryer. I was disappointed because the woman working in the skincare section highly recommended it... so glad I only tried a sample, as I definitely will NOT buy this product.",4
Only was able to spray once and the bottle became clogged. Rinsed it under hot water and it still didn’t work. Other people on the tatcha website said the same thing but the company removed their reviews a day later. Don’t waste your money.,0
"Only works if your face cleanser is LIQUID, LATHERS, and YOU HAVE CLEAR SKIN. Otherwise it does nothing. Returned bc I use a special bar facial soap and my dermatologist said that he doesnt reccomend this for acne prone skin bc it causes scarring in the long run.",0
"'On Mute' is the only wearable shade on it's own. The other lipsticks are too pale and need a lipliner to make them work. The lip gloss has a ""frosty"" look to it. Waste of money for only 1 decent shade.",2
"On my 2nd bottle. Not sure that Im seeing results. I've no doubt that I'm getting daily moisture, but thats it. Love that its clean   the packaging. Love the squalane...anxious to try their newest release.",2
"On my skin, this translated to pure glitter. It is very sparkly and that's not usually a look I go for with highlighters. If you like a shimmery highlighter, you would love this. It has a golden champagne shimmer to it and you would be seen from outer space. You can also mix it in with foundations and it mixes really well. If you don't like the visible shimmer but you like the concept and the shade, try the top ford soliel glow drops. They have no visible shimmer in them and look like pure glowy goodness on the skin",0
"On my third bottle. As a guy I enjoy using this product because it has no scent - unlike most of OH products. A little guess a long way. Vit C takes prolonged use to show results, so I'm sticking with this eye cream for the long run.",1
OOoooh my where has this been all my life ? first of I WAS SENT THIS PRODUCT.. COMPLIMENTARY.. TO REVIEW  ...I ALWAYS give a  very honest review.. what works for some of us don't always jive with all of us. But ...i love this product and yes it works great for me.. it's great for a no make up day.. it leaves my face quenched and so soft. it blends in beautifully it doesn't feel heavy either. it looks like i have great skin ..lol.. i definitely  recommend  this product to try.. especially if you like your no make up days . it's a really great product. will I buy it ? ABSOLUTLY  !!!,3
"ordered online because the picture/swatch looked like the highlighter would be BEAUTIFUL on my pair skin. OH WAS I WRONG! i agree with others that it looks like a muddy stripe on my face. Sooo much darker in person.  would have kept as an eyeshadow but i already have colorpop's shadow in ""snakebite"" that gives me the same look.  Gloss was great though but but not for $24",1
Originally got the 7 day trial size for this product and after one nights use i automatically saw a reduction of my acne inflammation. I had a fresh day old scar and after finishing the 7 day trail size the scar is almost completely gone!! I have super oily skin on my T-zone and it hasn't done much for that but i have seen a reduction in oil production. My skin is absolutely glowing and def recommend buying this! Bought my first whole bottle and already want to buy my second one,0
Other than a bullet tube looking unique it's a forty dollar waste. Lipstick drags and pulls with application.  Realness is the only color that a tried but I don't think I would waste another dime on this brand.,3
"Other than the high price tag, I have no complaints about this liner. It has been perfect so far. It is incredibly easy to use and the dual tips are a bonus that. make it even easier to get a great line. The formula wears well and has not smudged, faded or ran. It is a nice black and is not overly shiny.",2
"out of the 3 drawers full of palettes I own, this is the only one I think I would replace if I lost my entire collection and could only own 1 palette. soooo good! the colors are beautiful and look as beautiful (if not better) on the eyes! esp in daylight",0
"Out of the 9 products, I have used 5 products in the past and just love them: bite lip balm (new formula, had used a few of their samples), too faced better than sex mascara, anastasia beverly hills brow gel (I have finished 5 of those already!), nars velvet lippie (but used the shade mysterious red but the formula is amazing!), and urban decay all nighter spray! \n\nI have no problem in stocking up those products again! Can't wait to try the other products, especially the laura mercier caviar stick and the fenty beauty highlighter. \n\nVery good deal and that too on a reduced price! Ps. I bought my first one at regular price for my sister and she loved it! :)",0
"Overall, I’m loving this new foundation. It sets quickly, has a matte finish with medium coverage. I occasionally have dry skin and this product does seem to show any dry patches. So, it can be a great stand alone foundation but if you have dry skin I would recommend you prep the face well before application.",0
"Overall, it's not bad and provides adequate coverage. I found it to be a bit on the oily side; remedied with a little extra setting powder. It lasted roughly 6ish hours without setting spray, 10ish with setting spray.  Third in my rotation of medium coverage foundations, with Kat von D True Portrait and Tarte Shape Tape surpassing. If you're loyal to the brand, it's an OK buy.",1
"overall nice colored lip balms. slightly waxy and minty. doesn't real ""plump"" though. nice to carry around when you don't need a lot of color and want something sheer. Not too shiny. fair moisturizing -sometimes the minty addition can dry out lips. but constant reapplication overcomes that quickly. The colors are sheer. I and since it's a balm, there is minimal staying power on the lips over the day. good sizes and easy to apply. bought on sale with the addn'l - otherwise probably wouldn't have gotten it. but no regrets.",2
"Overall nice primer, nice applicator, keeps the shadow and eyeliner in place well. Only four stars because there's no real wow factor to it and I don't think it amplifies the color or staying power of my shadow more than any other basic primer",0
"Overall, this is an amazing value and product! One star for each of the 4/5 glosses in this set that were absolutely perfect! BE WARNED the shade ""pretty please"" is a nice shade, but is GRIIITTTYYY! I actually CANNOT stand the feel of it on my lips and its going in the trash! which makes me sad (hence the loss of one star). Do not do what I did and swatch that one 1st on your lips. It'll make you think that the other 4 are gritty too (If you don't completely wipe off the super chunky glitter from the pretty please shade). The other 4 shades have that same smooth/balmy feel of the original gloss bombs. I hope they make these permanent and fix the issue with the disgusting feel of the ""pretty please"" shade (because the color is sooo pretty :( ).",0
"overall this only good for touchups on the go + the travel case is nice. The foundation brush is not good, they should have included the rouge foundation brush instead. Same thing goes for the concealer brush. you could fit an extra 1-2 brushes in if they're small. powder brush is good.",0
"Overall, this product is a good liquid liner. Definitely very black and matte, and stats on (most) of the day. I have hooded eyes, so choosing an eyeliner is very difficult for me. This eyeliner almost always flaked off by the end of the day. I also have had issues with the applicator tip drying out. Wanted to love, but again, in search of a better option for me. \n\nPROS: Very black and matte, easy to apply\nCONS: Flaked off by end of the day, rubs off on upper eyelid, applicator dries out sometimes",3
overpriced and doesnt clean sponge applicators well. i washed one of the supplied sponges immediately after use and it remains very stained. one star given as i can actually use the sponge. i used the soap to clean my brushes so it wasn't a complete waste. not worth 60$,1
"over the past 10 years of buying/trying foundations. this is, no joke, the ONLY foundation I have ever repurchased. I've worn it in all seasons in all climates, to school, to work, on flights, you name it. whenever I wear it I've never looked at my makeup and not been impressed by how good my foundation looks. of course it doesnt last forever but it fades so gracefully I dont really notice. it doesnt hurt that the color scheme in this line is utter perfection. 4.75 matches my skin so well I hope Armani never stops making this foundation. will repurchase forever.",4
"Paid full price for this palette, so this is a real review. The colors in the Glambition make my blue eyes pop. Highly pigmented, so I use a very light had and carefully blend. Have had no issues with excessive fallout. Case is sleek and great for travel. Not a fan of the colors in the Steeletto.",2
"Pale Gold 002: First you better like glitter. Theres DEFINITELY beautiful gold glitter in it. It takes the tiniest amount get get an impact. I'm talking a dab will do ya. It works great any place you want to highlight with glitter. I was shocked to see its size. Like travel toothpaste small, so it's a bit overpriced @ $30. I bought mine during Pat's black Fri. sale $21.  If the blue one goes on sale. Then I'll pick it up. It's too tiny for $30. The tube is only 2/3 full (see pic). I have only swatched mine once & you'll see how much is left.  If you like a bright yellow gold with micro glitter; similar to Pat's 10 pan palette special shades. I'm betting youll like this too, but wait for a sale!",3
"Patch test first!! I've never considered myself to have especially sensitive skin, but after using this product for a few days, I noticed my skin starting to peel and wasn't sure what was causing it. Tonight I removed my makeup to find a raised orange rash on my forehead, plus a lot of angry red patches and bumps all over. I had my suspicions that it might be this Ren Ahi Toner since it always stung a little when I applied it (thought that was normal) but after reading all the 1 star reviews with similar results, it confirmed for me that this product is the cause. It's definitely not for everyone -- even if you don't think you have sensitive skin!",1
"Pat's eyeshadows are unlike any other eyeshadow I've ever worn.   I love the application. You can apply it soft or layers to make it bolder. For bold application, using your fingers was best.   Very blendable with the other colours in the palette.  Not sure if they would mix well with other brands, which it's why it loses a star for me. There is a lot of shimmer,  with little fall out.",2
"people complain that this are tiny, but the blush is 3.5g which is more than other full sized blushes (mac mineralize is 3.2g, tarte 3.2g) so in reality you are getting a full size blush in a tiny container and a mini balm too. compare prices and grams with other brans and you'll  see this is a good deal",2
Perfect colour PERFECT.  they used to have a liquid version that was a bit better for staying power.  this guides on so nice the packaging is gorgeous BUT it has no staying power.  It smudges at the lightest touch and  comes off on everything so you have to reapply every 5 minutes,4
Perfect coverage for me. 3 piece combo is great. Absolutely not transfer resistant which is an annoyance but the look and feel of the product make up for this issue. Setting spray is a must unless you want to leave makeup prints.,4
perfect coverage. I have normal to dry skin with tendencies to break out because of product. 39yrs old with some fine lines and a little redness in the morning. this product covered was amazing it did not amplify my pores or my fines lines under my eyes and had enough coverage to reduce the slight dark circles and redness in my face without looking heavy. and maybe I am imagining this but 2 weeks of use and I feel my skin does look more even in texture.,2
"Perfect easy to use lashes! I wore the style dreamy. They are absolutely beautiful on the eyes, the length was good, didnt need to trim them. they are lightweight on thr eyes, cant really feel them. easy to apply. and I love the packaging on them.",1
Perfect for folks who prefer liquids over creams.  It moisturizes my very dry skin and soaks in wonderfully.  I personally prefer a thicker formula but I really have nothing major against this other than price.,1
Perfect for my skin. I have the T zone going on and i'm 59!! This is light enough for that area while quenching the desert of my cheeks. I've been using Ole's stuff for about 6 years and am constantly mistaken for my daughters sister instead of mother. The lovely orange scent is nice too.,3
"Perfect gift for a mascara lover! As a side note, I think all of these sell for 13 dollars individually? It's a great price for three minis.  I got this for my mom's Christmas stocking and it's so cute in the package that I'm not even going to steal the Ilia one even though it's my favorite mascara.",0
Perfect product for my dry skin. Some reviewers said that the moisturizer  is too greasy. Actually for me it's perfect. I use it as soon as after i wash my face. It dehydrate my skin so good and I bought another set again. I just love it!,3
"Performance wise this is awesome since it has staying power on my oily skin (with a primer on), colors are pigmented and smooth, creamy not too powdery to apply and blends nicely. This is definitely a splurge and I don't understand the high price tag. I assume much of the price is due to the packaging which is a bit ridiculous because it's heavy and bulky which I can't just pop in my purse to carry around with me. The stackables make more sense, but they don't have too much color ranges. I hope they come out with more reasonable color palettes that's not so pricey or I'm going to have to turn to other brands.",3
"perhaps I'm not using this product correctly but the product does not sit well with my dry skin. I tried with eye cream, eye primer, face primer, but it flakes after just an hour. very disappointed.\nif I'm not using this correctly, please let me know. I really like the feel of this product and the pretty bottle.",1
"Phenomenal Value! Wow! The Huda lashes are bold (for me, anyhow) but I look forward to an occasion when I can break them out. The It mascara is full size and my favorite mascara of all time- the other deluxe sizes are from top notch brands that I have been wanting to try out. Benefit gets a big yawn from me but I'm not mad about a second full size mascara to have on hand (or give to a friend). Basically, even if you only need one full size thing from this box it's super worth purchasing!",1
"Picked this up after using various cushions for the past 12+ years and discovering my favorite had been discontinued last summer right after I stocked up on refills. I finally ran out and couldn't find a suitable replacement, but I am so happy YouTube randomly fed me an Alexa Chung video with this in it. I don't have texture issues with my bare skin, but even with the super hydrating cushions, my skin would dry out and look awful in a couple hours. I have dry skin elsewhere on my body, so I assumed my face was the same way. I do my usual skincare and apply this only where I absolutely need it, and my skin has never felt so comfortable and looked this nice. And it stays that way ALL DAY, even now in the winter. It doesn't crack/crease anywhere I apply it, and I'm not experiencing the patches of dry, flakey skin that used to sneak up on me and get progressively worse throughout the day. I'm not sure how long the pot will last me, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be more cost effective than the cushions were.",2
"Picked this up on a whim as I was in Sephora--needed a pinky set. WOW--great purchase. Love love love the colors...i blend them -- they are light, great summer hues. The eye primer in the kit is my favorite this year.",3
"picked this up super early at my local Sephora inside JC Penney! they have them for sale in store before launch date (: love it so much much, use a tiny bit to moisturize during the day and love the slight glossy feeling on my lips, can't wait to try it tonight and see the results. I heard it sold out super fast last year and wasn't restocked, so I bought several to keep stocked up lol. love Tatcha!",4
Pigmentation is outstanding and long lasting. I'm not usually a matte fan but love the range or colours available; they blend really well. You barely have to touch the shimmers to get them to show up. Really like that it's a cooler tone. I did swap out a couple pans with the petite pro 3 palette to bring in the greens so I use just one palette every day.,3
Pleasantly surprised about this tool.  The spool end is short enough to to allow me to comb the brow without hitting anything else.  I like how easy it is to comb my brows and it even helps me brush them up for a quick trim.  The bonus is the cap so I can keep both ends clean while not in use.,2
"Please bring back the wrinkle resist 24 7 formula....pretty please.... it was my 1 staple for many years and I loved it, even wrote a review here about it, which I do not typically do.  Sooooo sad that you have discontinued a much better product... to give us this.  This dries out, doesn't plump the eye area, it doesnt bring the same results at all, my wrinkles seem to show more since this dries out ....  please reconsider...",3
"Please heed the warnings and be careful with this product! I have used many retinol products before (Roc, The Ordinary, Mad Hippie) so I figured I could easily handle a twice a week start. After the second application I started to peel and by the next day my face was so dry and sore it actually hurts..I have stopped using all products now exception FAB ultra repair cream.....start slowly!",3
"Please save your money! I bought this prestige product as an expensive treat for me. It imparts virtually no color whatsoever or highlights -- and I am fair skinned! The case is cheap, and the product poorly poured with gaps on one side. The only thing positive I can say is it smells good. I was totally underwhelmed and it went back! It certainly did not live up to the Guerlain name.",4
"Possibly the easiest lash to work with that's versatile enough for work and for after work activities.\n\nFirst off, the fact that I don't have to trim these lashes prior to using them is a big plus. I love the gradual flare (shorter in the inside and lengthens gradually towards the outside) and the fact that overall, it's not too dramatic that it takes away from my eye makeup. \n\nThe band is just the right weight and width so it's comfortable to wear.  Note however, that I'm very used to wearing fake lashes so unless the band is extremely thick, it's likely a non-issue for me.\n\nIf you take care of these lashes (i.e. remove glue, clean after every use, avoid coating them with mascara, etc.) you'll get quite a bit of use per pair.  They usually last me between 15 to 20 uses.",4
"Prefect! I can't say much more than that. It is the perfect shade. I can use it to conceal scars or under my eyes. I only need to set it when I'm going for a full glam look. It's great for light coverage days, when I'm just running errands.",1
"Pretty excited to try this out since I’ve needed an eye cream but really wanted one with SPF. I LOVE that this is mineral based since it’s gentler and more effective on my skin. 40s, live in high altitudes with gobs of sun. I tried it on one eye first to compare—it’s def. a little more brightening, and lightly conceals under eye circles. It’s a little sticky (it feels like the mineral matte sunscreen that I also love) so I’m guessing it’ll be a good primer for eyeshadow. I think this will be a new staple for me!",2
"Pretty happy overall. I used all the products but the belif cream, but I knew I wouldn't use that going into the purchase. I always like trying different things like this, I buy a lot of the Favorites sets they put together. This was a really good one, it's definitely worth it if that's your reservation. Hard to go wrong with so many items to choose from and try out!",1
"Pretty layout, and packaging. The whole thing skews blue-teal though on me. Not green or what emerald would be for me. The mint looking shade (top row in the middle) is almost non existent when I apply. Brown in bottom row is patchy. Shimmers/metallics are okay except for the good in the top row. It's tricky to get to stay with a damp or dry brush. Returning it soon. Disappointing since I LOVE the mauve version from these nine pans.",0
"Pricey, but oh so good. I stumbled upon this on the website. I am currently deployed and the water is heavily treated and chlorinated. the air is very dry. I have only been using this about 2 weeks but I'm in love. It all tastes good and I feel like it's a daily treat I look forward to. I plan to repurchase as soon as I get my 20% coupon. My skin needs this!",4
"Probably my favorite product from Herbivore. If I have the occasional pimple or redness, or even for dullness and pore size as I age, this mask is a champ. I use all over for clarity and pore size reduction, about 30 minutes. It takes a bit of manipulation to remove it - it's not harsh, just sort of re-wets before it finally wipes off. It's easier in the shower. I use it as a spot mask for occasional pimples, about 20 minutes. Inflammation is generally reduced by 30% right away, more if I follow it with their Lapis oil. The combo takes inflammation down by at least 70% the next morning. My teen daughter loves it, too, and she's experiencing some forehead acne. It's the only mask that clarifies and reduces redness without any side effects. For her, using it several times a week gets the best results.",2
Product absorbs nicely and provides a SPF w/moisturizing base. Easy to apply foundation after and it does allow absorption without competing for skin surface. Only negative is that it comes in a tub vs a tube. I prefer tubes for more accurate dispension and protection of product.,3
Product is too thick in consistency and the tip is too wide.and doesn't look natural at all.  I ended up throwing it away.   Complete waste of money.  IT Cosmetics universal taupe brow pencil is a million times better.,1
"Product itself is great, but would be better in a regular tube dispenser. The current tube comes with a sponge applicator and is annoying because 1) the cap is so tight that you have to squeeze on the tube in order to yank it off, wasting product, and 2) the sponge is surely breeding all sorts of microbes. The pots breed germs too.",1
"PROS: Excellent finish. Gives a subtle, sophisticated ""I woke up like this"" look. Perfect if you're not into that super glittery highlight. CONS: I wanted a mini size product for travel, but it is not offered in Medium Deep. As a WOC, I'm tired of not having the same options offered to me as lighter women. It's not as if they had 20 shades to offer. Only 2. So, please offer both in both size versions. I had to spend more money on the larger size, buy an empty container and create my own travel size. Big hassle. Not cool. At some point somebody will create a similar product with the same size options/conveniences for all. I'll give my money to them.",2
"Pros: feels very luxe going on, foams little, feels a bit like washing with a moisturizer. No strong scent. Good coverage with a relatively tiny amount. Rinsed easily. \n\nCons: not a makeup remover, while it removed powder based product like eyeshadow, it didn't remove lipstick. Wasn't wearing mascara, so not sure on that front. Pretty expensive.",4
"Pros: I've been looking for a good eye cream for yrs. I either get milia or the formula isn't moisturizing enough, or both. This does everything I've been looking for. Provides good moisture, makes my under eyes look less crepey & doesn't give me milia. I also haven't noticed any irritation. \n\nCons: It has a perfumey smell that was very concerning for me being that my skin is very sensitive to fragrance. Fragrance is not listed as an ingredient so hopefully it's a natural ingredient that won't cause issues in time. \nI thought people were overreacting to the packaging issue. I was wrong. Yes it's pretty but it's the worst functioning packaging I've ever experienced. I ended up depoting some product into a little jar I had on hand.",2
PROS: Lots of mattes and variety of shimmer shades (some more glittery than others).  Great mix of colors suitable for warm asian skin tone.  Wearable for every day.  Matte color payoff is good and buildable.  I adore the scent of the palette and it doesn't linger after application.\n\nCONS: Shimmer and glitter shades have disappointing color payoff.  Sometimes the shimmer is too understated.  This can be remedied with primer.,1
"Pros: Packaging, the pump is genius and dispenses the perfect amount of cream without causing a mess/contamination. Moisturizes well, doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. \n\nCons: Cost, none I can really think of. \n\nSo why the 3 stars instead of 5? I just didnt feel like it did anything more special than my other moisturizers in my collection.",0
"Pros: the colors are perfect for enhancing lips without screaming I'm wearing make up! The formula glides on nicely and the shape makes for good precision application. The gold packaging is so cute!!!\nCon: I've been using it for a week and have to click up more product every time I use it. My lips are full, but I've only done a full fill in once. So, I'm guessing this isn't going to last very long; sad for almost $30. I don't mind spending for good products, but this is going too quickly.",1
"PRO TIP: Remember to flip the foundation pad! Once the product pad dries flip it over and you will get many more uses. The product sinks to the bottom over time, so you must flip it.\n\nI tried this one against the YSL and La Mer cushions and for my dry pale acne prone skin this one wins (I will say La Mer and Givenchy cushion very similar).\nHydrating, medium coverage, not at all cakey it really looks like skin, does not dry me out at all. \nIt make crease a tiny bit (I don't usually set with powder) because it is so hydrating but all you do is tap it out and it is perfect again (or set with a powder).\nVery bright and radient. \nWill buy again and use daily. \nI will prime with either CoverFX Dewy Primer (super dewy finish) or Guerlain Water Lily Youth Oil + L'Or Primer (hydrating radient long lasting finish).",4
"PTR discontinued my fave foaming cleanser so I bought a few to try as replacements.  This foams well, and does a good job removing makeup.  A very little bit goes a LONG way.  My skin is normal to slightly oily, but I still find this cleanser a little bit strong for me.  Also, I forgot how ""bad"" Clinique products smell because they are perfume free.  ha ha!  I would recommend if you skin is oily or you have lots of heavy, creamy makeup to remove.  If your skin is dry or sensitive, I would not recommend.",3
"Pulls the lashes out and makes them look fuller and longer, while still looking natural. It also doesn't flake or smear and lasts super well!! Overall a great vegan mascara!! I received this product free to test from Influenster.",0
"purchased bc they were irresistibly cute but the balm is just ok. nothing special and I am not surprised since I bought the Christmas dog balm last year. although, I think that one worked better in terms of the balm. either way I'm keeping these to keep at my work desk in case if emergency. :) they are adorable",1
"Purchased because they discontinued Lancome Effernes 360 honey. This liquid is to dry under my eyes when it sets. Fine lines, it creases really bad on my upper eyelids. I look like an elder when using this product.  Do not apply to both eyes while concealing, as it dries extremely fast and then you can't work with blending the product.",1
Purchased the teal color which was a bit darker in person than  it appeared on the website.   This liner did not go on evenly for me nor did it last and had to be re-applied often.  It wasn't terrible but would not purchase again.,3
"Purchased this because it was supposed to be ""Fresh BERRY"" this is out and out Red. I have a great Red lip pencil from Pat Mcgrath, didn't need another red liner. Also this is really small from tip to end is 3.5 inches. Glad it was so cheap. Applied smoothly tho.",3
"Purchased this because I was mesmerized by the intense shade of forest green and I was looking for a substitute for Bobbi Brown since Sephora only carries a few colors of her iconic gel eyeliner.  The color didn't disappoint as it was so vivid and intense.  The eyeliner is long wearing as it lasted all day.  But I decided against keeping this because I found it to be less of a gel, but not a cream either.  It seemed not quite liquid and not quite qel.  I found it to be too wet during application and taking too long to try.  If I applied too thick a coat, the product would transfer to my lower lids.  No problem removing the liner at night using regular eye makeup remover.  I still prefer Bobbi Brown, but I've noticed fewer color options available with that line, which is really disappointing. I wanted Melt to be my replacement, but it didn't work well for me.",3
"Purchased this for myself a few weeks ago because these are all products I've wanted to try from Bite, but didn't want to purchase the full sizes. I love everything - the hydration is long-lasting and my lips feel softer after using the nighttime mask before bed for the past two weeks.\n\nThe only issue I had was with the lip balm; because the sample size is so small, the actual stick of lip balm was very unstable and broke in half the first time I used it. A bummer, since I absolutely love this product. My lips feel hydrated for a long time with reapplication and it gives your lips a nice, natural glossy look. I'll definitely buy the full size lip balm, but it was a shame that the sample size in this set didn't physically hold up.",1
"Purchased this product in hopes it would do what it says it will do, to stay all day.   Sadly, no. As soon as I put it on, I wanted to readjust the angle of my wing so I rubbed it with a dry finger. It came off easily,  a little too easily,  so I reapplied and I waited 45 mins before trying to rub the liner with a dry finger and again it came off without so much as a tug!!!  I expect a liner to smear,  but not completely rub off!",2
"Put this on in the car after I bought it. A bit too shiny, but I liked the colour and thought I could manage it. By the time I got home my lips were dry and sore. Not a ""balm"" in any sense of the word. Instant return.",3
"quick rating before a review \n5/5 would buy another bottle \n4/5 like the way it looks\n4/5 recommend to others to buy\nalright! so first off I received a bottle of this to sample and give a review before even knowing what I was getting. I've never used an eye cream so I didn't have anything to compare it to other than the normal moisturizer or sunscreen I'd use under my eye every day prior. \nwith that being said I absolutely loved the bright eye  eye cream! it has a slight shimmer to it so when you use it the area under your eyes and around really do look brighter because its reflecting a bit of light. my husband who looks at my face everyday immediately noticed the difference and said I looked more alert and my eyes stood out more. \na little goes a long way so be sure to lightly push it in to your skin to fully absorb because if not you'll get the one thing that irritated me which was if it didn't fully absorb it would kind of clump?? so I spread it out more and lightly pushed it in more to my skin. \nthe only other thing I didnt love was that the product would sort of dry out in the dispenser so when I'd pump it out I had a small amount that was too hard or dried out to use. \noverall the eye cream did what it literally labeled as being ""bright eyed"". i felt pretty using it and love that it provides sun protection.",1
"Quite a pricey product, but well worth it! It works so well for resurfacing and brightening your skin! Not harsh at all. I love that her products can be mixed to make your own personalized smoothie for your face! Nothing else like it! Highly recommend!",2
"Quite disappointed. I've only tried the sheet masks from Tatcha and they were outstanding. After such high reviews (and high prices) for this brand I was expecting better. This isn't very moisturizering and burns my eyes if even the slightest amount gets on my eyelashes, and I don't have sensitive eyes. It really doesn't feel like I've put much of anything on, no matter how much I apply. My $22 Mario Badescu eye cream is SO much more effective than this. I'm so disappointed that it even makes me hesitant to try any of the other products by this brand that I wanted to try.",4
"Really beautiful colors. I have been looking for a green palette, something that leans more towards olive tones rather than the emeralds in my Melt palette. I've always liked these colors with my brown eyes, and glad to see that they are starting to become popular again. Of course, they are high quality and pigmented - quite faithful to the quality of ND's larger palettes. I am happy I chose to treat myself!",4
"Really comfortable lipstick and it does last. Not drying. Old Rose is nuetral mauve. A your lips but better color. This was part of the Next Big Thing Favorites set and my only disappointment was it is ""that"" color. The light to medium nuetral that usually fits most but is a bit meh. And that every brand is offering. The formula is great so I will purchase another color in the future.",3
really creamy and glides on smoothly. i use this for my bottom tight liner and use benefits for my top wing. it doesn't smudge or budge regardless of sweat and oil buildup. my eyes looked amazing all day,0
"Really cute but does nothing!!! Feels like a glue stick. I have no clue what everyone is going on about, since I would REALLY like to like this product. Received within a set and was excited to have it; eyes were feeling terrible, so couldn't wait to use it. Disappointing.",2
"Really disappointed. Only tried it because the Diorshow waterproof was sold out.  Love the regular Better Than Sex, but the waterproof version doesn't go on smoothly, is clumpy, and flakes.  Returned it. Will be sticking with Diorshow!!",3
"Really enjoyed this spray, I have been using this as a base before applying my makeup and at night before I use my phone. SUPER hydrating and definitely gave me a little glow! I will continue to use at night while I use my phone. Super cool that a product like this exists.",0
Really excited about the belief cream. =) Great size for traveling.  The play points are expired! =/  Which I am sad about! So with that said for 9 bucks it not bad. But i am excited to try a few new products from the box.,0
"Really gorgeous blush, case interior looks awful. I LOVE the product- I just can't help but be completely put off by the plasticine water-bottle affect of the inside of the compact. Really disparate, IMO.",2
"Really great for travelling!!! The material feels really nice and i'm pretty sure it's easy to clean too! Took one star away, just because i wish the bigger brushes would fit in better! it's better for small brushes!",0
Really great product. I tried this Lancer clarifying detox mask with green tea and 3% sulfur and absolutely loved it. As a 46 year-old woman with a little bit of dull and drab skin this made my skin look and feel amazing it brought the youth back :-) I love the way my skin looks and feels when using this,3
"Really great value set as you get the full sized lipstick and a travel-sized lip liner for less than the cost of if you were to purchase the lipstick alone.\nHowever, the site should be updated as the lip liner is only 0.02 oz and not 0.04 oz as advertised.",0
"Really  impressed with the fresh clean feel of my teeth as I brush with this toothpaste. When done, I am left with a refreshing clean mouth that leaves me feeling confident. Much better than all the drugstore toothpaste I’ve been using this past year. Also love the bright white difference I’m already seeing. WINNING product selection!",2
Really like this little pallette. Rich shades that are butter smooth and blendable. Small size makes it great for travel. Really nice for those of us who have no reason to spend 100+ dollars on a large ND pallette.,4
"Really like this product. I've been meaning to try it for a long time and when I saw this smaller size available, I went for it. I need high SPF because of medical issues and this is the first product I've tried where I like the blend of makeup wth SPF. I will say that when it first goes on, there is a little odor of sunscreen but it goes away once its blended in completely. Evens out my skin tone  without giving a ""pancake makeup"" look. I will buy the full size when I am finished with this one.",3
"Really love this product.  It’s perfect for my super sensitive skin.  My skin was markedly improved within a few days of use.  I will say that after the first week I had some bumps emerge, but I think that’s to be expected as your skin purges (I know that sounds gross).  My pores are smaller and my skin glows minus the flaking and irritation that RetinA or other retinol products gave me.",4
"Really love this stuff. I've never really had dark circles, but I feel like my eyes have always looked tired and puffy. This stuff has really made a difference. I feel like my eyes look more awake and the skin underneath seems tighter than it normally is. I did receive this product complimentary and I will continue to use it until I'm out. I'm thoroughly impressed with Glow Recipe and can't wait to try more of their stuff!",1
"Really love this tinted moisturizer. I have combination-dry skin in the winter and I live in the desert. This stuff smells very lightly of vanilla, goes on easily, doesn't oxidize to a darker color, and mutes my red areas without making it look too covered up and cakey.",0
Really loving this product. I’ve been taking it for a couple weeks and i definitely feel a difference in my skin. My sleep has also improved significantly. The capsules don’t irritate my stomach or have funky smell. I’m very pleased.,0
"really nice and gentle scrub. I use it two to three times a week, and it's so gentle it doesn't strip your skin or cause any redness or irritation. you can feel the beads scrubbing and cleaning your pores, but they dont feel abrasive. I love this scrub, and definitely recommend it.",4
Really not impressed with this primer. It didn't even out my skin and I can definitely see lines anyway. Maybe those lines are too deep/I'm too old for this primer to help. But it still doesn't help my foundation to actually stay put.,2
Really wanted this to work because the price is unbelievable. I actually really liked the way this performed under foundation and it made my makeup last the whole day but broke out my cheeks and irritated my sensitive skin.,0
"Really wanted to fall in love with this shower cream as I absolutely love the moisturizer and scent in general. When you initially apply this it smells wonderful and lathers beautifully... until it then begins to take on that horrible old ""soapy"" smell that so many products do. \n\nPro: Smells amazing for 5 seconds and applies nicely.\n\nCon: Quickly turns into the scent of an 80 year old woman who uses nothing but bar soap.",0
"Really wanted to love it. It just takes too much time to apply, if you do it the ""right"" way (dab, let sit, then blend with fingers) and didn't have enough coverage for me. I could still see some darkness. It helped, but not as much as I needed it to.",0
Really wanted to love this mascara. I have been a Perversion and Diorshow lover for years and was ready for something new. This mascara clumps really easy and gets brittle before you can even finish putting it on. Does not create the fanned out look at all. Usually end up having to use a comb or safety pin to comb out eyelashes afterwards. Not a fan. Going back to my old trustees.,0
"really wanted to love this. my friend raved about this CC cream and kept bringing it up in conversation. I'm super weary to commit to fountain (it's the only makeup staple that I haven't found 'my favorite' of) so was excited to try this product given her endorsement. I'm so disappointed! \n\nthe formula is cakey and made my pores seem larger and the shade is WAY off. I used the Sephora shade finder and plugged in my usual foundation (Armani Luminosities Silk in 3.75 - which is even a tad too light for me) and the shade finder matched me with Light in this product. Ok, great. makes sense, I'm pretty pale. the Light is sooo dark. I was surprised. I checked the package 3x. I double checked my receipt. they're definitely all labeled 'Light'. but the formula is strangely dark. \n\nother reviews have mentioned that the shade range seems off. I definitely agree. how disappointing but glad I bought the mini before committing to the full sized product.",4
really wanted to love this product. it feels amazing when you first put it on. but I agree with several other reviewers that it made my lips start peeling almost right away. I didn't have chapped lips prior to using it but now I do. I stuck it out for 3 weeks too see if maybe my lips would adjust. they did not. I will be returning it.,2
"received a deluxe sample to try out. the packaging is very elegant,  the product absorbed very quickly and did not leave any greasiness on my skin. I cannot attest to any of its anti aging effects because every time I use this cream my skin dries out so badly it hurts. I always end up using another moisturizer on top to relieve the pain from dry skin. no thanks.",4
"Received as a complimentary gift, and will def repurchase. OBSESSED with how smooth and easy this is to use. I get a great winged eyeliner look every time! I also love that it's waterproof and long-lasting, smudge-free all day babyyyy.",1
"Received as a sample. I felt like I had to work a lot to get results from this mascara. It seemingly takes out any curl previously put in by a lash curler, and then the mascara flaked all over my face after 6 or so hours of wear. Not my favourite, would not purchase.",1
"Received free from Influenster and I found when I put it over the primer it got spidery and clumped so it's not yet my fav. Gonna try it without the primer. The brush is standard and not my fav either. Good amount of product though, HUGE tube.",1
"Received free from Influenster. I absolutely love this as an informal or work-friendly lipstick. Sheer definitely means sheer. If you want intensity, try to Gucci satin, which I also sampled. But this falls right into that sweet spot where it's more visible than a gloss and isn't nude, but is delicate enough that it looks good without a full face, or as a foil to a dramatic eye. Plus...this makes fantastic backup blush! Not just a gimmick. Blends beautifully onto cheekbones for a natural flush. Love the packaging. The porcelain rose styling feels retro in the best way (reminds me of my grandmother, in a happy-memories way), and there's a pleasurable heft in the hand.",2
"Received in Sephora Play box. Really did not like this as a cleanser. Did not remove Tarte foundcealer foundation. I noticed makeup still coming off when I used my toner and had to wash again with another cleanser. Also felt a slight burning on my skin whrn using it. Someone said it smells like old fruit, and they are exactly correct. Not pleasant.",2
Received these in my voxbox complimentary. Not a fan of the style. They applied easily and didnt require me to cut the band. But they were too curly and kept touching my eyelids! I would try other styles though.,1
"Received this as a full-size bonus (don't remember with what).\nPositives: Coated lashes consistently, smooth formula, no clumps buuuuut\nNegatives: Made my lashes flat flat flat, as if I hadn't just curled them. This mascara might work well for naturally curled lashes but mine just looked sad. Formula flaked all over. Big NO, won't ever purchase this.",3
"received this as part of the play subscription box.  i was excited to try this out since i have large pores and am just starting to explore the world of primers. unfortunately this product did not have any affect on me and it did not blend in. I had lots of white flakes after using this product.  glad I got to try this out, on to the next pore product!",3
"Received this bottle yesterday and I was shocked at how overpriced this item is. It's a regular glass bottle with a sleeve. Nothing special. Definitely not worth the price, and I purchased it on sale for $22. I just returned it and had to write a review to save others the trouble. How is this company selling this bottle for over $30, I don't understand. It is not worth more than $7. Save your money!",2
"Received this in my boxycharm months ago...I use it almost every night as part of my nightly skincare routine but I dont think it's made much of a difference. Also, if I shake the bottle it sounds like theres still product inside but I can barely get any to pump out :/ \nI've got a few more serums that I've yet to try so I'll probably toss this one. Didnt do any harm but definitely not worth $86",0
"Received this in the Play box and can see how many others have trouble using it. It doesn't play well with the serums or moisturizers in my skin prep and gets gummy when applied on top of skin care. It requires lots of blending to make the texture align with other serums, but the overall effect is nice after all the pilling is wiped away. Lasts all day. Same when lightly patted on top of tinted moisturizer or foundation - lots of gumminess and pilling. A similar brightening effect can be had with other products without the fussing. Happy to try it but I won't purchase it.",3
recently received dr Dennis Gross liquid peel as a sample from pinch me. Have only been using it 1 week and already love it. Burned a little bit the first day of use but no burning after that. I have rosacea so I was concerned about trying it but it caused no redness to my face. Skin felt smooth after using it. Easy to apply with a cotton ball and only need to use a little. Although expensive I think it is worth the price. Have used several expensive facial products and no others made my face feel this good. Excited to see if it reduces my fine lines after several weeks of use.,4
"Recently received this product and not sure I can keep using it because of the smell. It smells like old lady perfume on my face! Horrible! If you don’t mind having your face smell your grandmother, then by all means purchase this product. I’m going back to my regular brand san-perfume.",3
"Recieved a mini sample in the colour Birthday Suit. I don't know how it's possible for a product to be too creamy so that it doesn't even stay on the lips, the colour won't stay anywhere except the very outside of my lips. Yet so drying that it grabs onto every rough patch.",4
"Recieved my order yesterday, used it last night. Light tea tree oil scent, not over powering at all. Felt slight cooling and calming sensation. Woke up to visibly calmer skin. Felt very balanced. No dry or oily patches. This is my new love! This will replace my Glamglo Supertoner.",3
"Recieved this product from my friends at Influenster to review. I am a first time user of Dermalogica,  I love this product, in 3 weeks I have seen a difference in my skin texture and a reduction of breakouts bt at least 90%. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin.",3
"Recommended to me in store, planning on returning. I’m 52, look much younger and yet it had a very unattractive appearance even after applying w a brush, beauty blender, fingers, primer/no primer etc. Bottom line, it looks awful on my light to light medium skin tone.",3
"redo packaging please, it's very messy, unhygenic and wasteful. Product accumulates on wand, threading for cap and lid, when opening or closing air pushes product out and it's hard to clean out. preferred squeeze tube better. there's tons of other great concealers you can get that don't do this.",4
"Reflect is really a gorgeous color. But I could not get this to apply evenly to my lids. I watched several videos. Tried a brush, tried my fingers, just didn't like the way it applied. And the fallout is real! Glitter EVERYWHERE.",3
"Regardless of the packaging of this product, it's the product that does not work for me.  It is a thicker oil that I use, but just as effective for removing makeup from my face.  However, it does NOT remove my eye makeup and gets in my eyes, unlike Philosophy's Release Me, which unfortunately, they no longer make.  I love some of Tatcha's products, but not this one!",3
"RE: Lip Balm.  Heads up: this balm has some plumping feature to it.  Received this yesterday and noticed the tingling sensation shortly after applying.  With sensitive skin, am very aware of how these affect and typically do not purchase (did not realize when bought).  However, it has been benign thus far AND noticed in Givenchy detail on stand-alone balm says can be used under other lip wear.  For me,that is how I will use this product because it has a benign affect and may even provide some plumping and it is a mild color that sort of deepens my existing lip color.  This balm depends on your goal for purchasing.  (Not a moist look) Have not used mascara as yet.",2
Rescue my severe dry lips during the accutane course. I used to reach for just regular Vaseline but Vaseline made my lips flaky. This one does not do that. Plus my lips feel moist all day (I have to apply a few times throughout the day),0
Review for Blackcurrant\n\nVery matte and stays on all day and night. Need to re-apply in the inside lips after eating greasy food and drinking too. The outer lips still has colour. However it did not stay long enough during teeth cleaning with dental hygienist. Colour went to the chin and around mouth and on hygienist’s gloves. Blackcurrant is my darkest and colour is same colour you see in the container. Non-drying,3
"Revolutionary matte gel formula!! No other trending powdery gel type lipstick holds a candle to this(Bobbi Brown/Shiseido/Mac/Lancome, they've all offered a similar formula in 2018, but they don't come close to these babies!)& btw, No One does RED like Armani!\n I love everything from this heritage brand.\nWith unrivaled staying power, hydrating powder gel consistency, pure comfort, And INCREDIBLE COLOR, I can confidently say, it's my favorite matte of all time! \nMatte formula, but will transfer a little. So do check your teeth often if you're wearing the Darker reds/Plum shades.. \nI bought all the reds and ultimately in love with 402. Its a head turner to say the very least ;0)\nI Also grabbed, 501 and 102. All wonderful. I'd buy them all!!!",2
"Richly pigmented, nice size pans, click closure. If you can afford a good quality bronzer brush, grab one as it will better deliver product to your skin. Also, try blending one or more colors together to create your signature look.  The lower far right highlighter is very close to Nars Orgasm blush, and mixed with a bit of clear lip gloss, looks so pretty!  These are multi-use pans, not just blush/bronzers.  Several will work great for a monochrome look, especially for spring and summer.  Very happy with this purchase.",3
Ruins expensive brushes. What a stink. I agree with another reviewer that this is nothing but paint thinner.  I was extremely careful but now all the hairs are falling out of my more expensive brushes.  Going back to using Clinique's eye makeup remover for daily use and shampoo for the once a week. More time but less expensive in the long run and NO stink!,4
"Sadly, I have to confirm what other reviewers are stating about these liquid lipsticks. The results from the liquid lipsticks, in person, do not match what is being shown online whatsoever. I am of medium-tan skin tone, right now, since it is almost winter I am pretty pale so I would say I am a lighter medium skin tone. These colors totally wash me out! They are so pale. I had seen all the swatches on medium to dark skin ones and I thought the colors looked really pigmented and varied from light to almost dark colors. That is not what I received. All the colors are about the same and very light. I have already begun my return process.",1
"Sadly it did not work well at all. The powder was not very fine at all, it was even gritty at times. The setting mist felt like it did nothing to extend the makeup wear. I really wanted to like this set, because it is such a great deal, but sadly, it's a hard no for me.",1
"Sadly, this broke me out.  I used it as a night time moisturizer with a few drops of facial oil mixed in.  When I woke up, I'd have these tiny blemishes (ones that are close to the surface and easily popped) and thought it was my serum or oil.  I cut out the serum, still got blemishes. I cut out oil, still got blemishes.  Then I cut this out and replaced it with my trusted moisturizer,  and the blemishes went away.  May work wonder for others, but it's not for me.",2
"Sadly this foundation would consistently break me out and leave my skin with dry patches for weeks after. No matter how prepped or moisturized my skin was, upon application and upon taking my makeup off my skin was terribly dry.\nAlone, with no color correcting, this foundation made hyperpigmentation much more visible and dark.\nI would reccommend this to anyone with sensitive, dry, acne prone or even textured skin, it made all those attributes worse.",4
sadly this is going back and I am a Bobbie brown fan. This palette looks beautiful but there is no pigment at all. the colors are washed out. I am very disappointed I have never sent back a beauty product.,3
"Sadly, this primer doesn't work very well for me. I reccomend getting mini sizes or samples to try before buying full size.\nDescription: A thin consistency w/a purple hue. It's mildly scented, but that dissipates quickly. A good primer to layer under others (if other benefits needed -pore fill, smoothing, etc) because of the consistency. \n\nOVERALL: Not for me, basically does nothing\nPositives - Very mild redness correction\nNegatives - Doesn't do enough as a primer; No brightening/glow; No smooth/blur in overall skin texture, fine lines, or pores -addt. primer needed; Dried out my already very dry skin (worst thing)\n\nDETAILED Review: Sometimes my skin gets really red and sensitive; normally it's very dry w/occasional redness. I got this primer for both situations to even skin tone/color. I also hoped it would bring a glow/brightness to my pale skin. I used it several times w/both skin conditions, w/different foundations, w/different moisturizers, but I didn't see much positive benefit with use. My makeup looked bad, like I wasn't wearing primer.\nThe good thing about this primer is that it does give some mild redness correction on cheeks, but not much (not bare skin use or severe redness). I feel like there's better things out there for redness, and this isn't a good primer in other ways.\nI didn't get any type of brightening/glow effect. It didn't hurt, but it did dry out my already very dry skin. My makeup clings more to dry patches when I use this as my only primer. I was disappointed, as it's supposed to be hydrating, I moisturize well, and use hydrating foundation/bases. I do prefer primers with more smoothing/blurring effects than this has. I mixed this primer w/a more smoothing one and they melded well (no pilling, etc), but the first light still had the same issues.\n\nMy mom (50) tried it and disliked it. She said her skin was sticky all day (even with powder), makeup was splotchy, it felt heavy, and she didnt see benefits like she does w/her normal primer.",0
"Samples usually don’t work like this! I usually have to buy the product to Really get a good feel for it, but this Dr Dennis Gross Pore Perfecting and Refining serum really works. I am always trying to clean and cover my Large, oily, stopped up pores, only to make it worse than before. With this serum, it seems to squeeze my\nPores closed. At the end of the night I can wash\nMy face and it seems to help keep the funk out! Typically I remove my makeup to find a number of Red, blocked, and aching pores needing to have a desperate cleaning, but not with this stuff! It’s now one of my holy grail items. Nothing else works like this serum does For keeping my cystic acne, caused by build up and gunk, in check...and I have used a LOT of different serums and creams. Absolutely worth every penny.",1
"Save your money. I Suffer from severe hand eczema I was so excited to see this new product.  Not worth the price, I went thru the tube too fast. This is no better than Aveeno or Gold Bond eczema hand cream that you can buy anywhere.",3
"Saw an ad for this pencil and seen it had some redhead-friendly shades, so I was excited to try it. As a redhead, it’s hard to find a eyebrow pencil. Auburn’s are typically too red or orange, even light browns can be too dark, so I usually have to get taupes. I found my perfect shade in this line and thought, “Yes, finally.” Unfortunately, this still isn’t quite perfect. They nailed the color, just not the consistency. This pencil is not smooth. At all. My brows are very sparse so to get any shape or coverage I have to draw really short, feathery strokes, which is more time consuming. If this formula had a softer formula with more “slip” to it, I’d go buy 20 of these pencils tomorrow.",1
Scooped this up during the VIB sale- I had been hesitant due to the price but loved the idea of this product!  The idea worked!!  This looks so nice & it really brightens up my eye area.  I pat it under my eyes after my eye cream has set & it works so well.  Feels really nice with moisture & does not dry out your under eye area or crease.  Just be sure to use the small amount recommended & pat it until blended.  It's perfect for adding a little coverage & glow.  Thanks Tatcha!!,3
"Score, finally found a line that makes nude lipstick for women of color. I love this shade this matte formula yet not drying love this on my lips. Please don’t ever discontinue. I cannot say enough good about this lipstick. Kudos Huda.",2
"Sensitive , over 40 skin but love this product. I use a daily moisturizer twice a day / night so I added this retinol into my routine and I have been using it for a few weeks now.  It’s been great so far.  I don’t have any deep lines yet , just minor wrinkles that need some plumping.  This has been great with helping with that.",1
Sephora consultant color matched my skin-tone with the products I needed.\nI found that I may have been over thinking this whole makeup thing. My Sephora Consultant guided me through to some really great products and each one that we used I found to be refreshingly easy to use.,2
"Sephora doesn't stock my holy grail, but this is the closest to it. Textured like a serum, it feels light and fresh, and doesn't reduce the longevity of my makeup as much as other thicker sunscreens. I also appreciate the clean-ish ingredients. Coola, if you make an oily skin version, I'm so here for it!",0
"Sephora...my daughter and I LOVE advent calendars so we were excited to try the Sephora Frosted Party one.  The packaging is very cute and I like how it folds out.  And that is really where the love ends and turns into only a passing like.  There were way TOO many repeats.  Sephora has some great house brand products and more of them should have been included.  I won't be buying this one next year unless there is promise of improvement.  Play track...whah, whah, whaaaaaaaaaaah.",3
"Sephora, please make these mists a permanent item! I have them in both rose and coconut. They're a convenient size for travel (I always keep one at my desk at work) and the mister is amazing. It's a non-aerosol that gives a fine, even spray - it outperforms some more expensive mists I've tried which dispensed big droplets. I also like that it's alcohol-free, and the fragrance is pleasant but not overly strong.",2
"SERIOUSLY!!! Get this eye shadow palette! I am an eye shadow palette junkie! I have never used Melt before but I will now! The colors are rich and unique, the pigment soars over any other, its a combination of jeweled deep vibrating tones and solid mattes. It goes on beautifully and stays on, blends smooth and the combinations are endless. Get this palette you are worth it!!!",3
Seriously the best cream I've used in my 26 years of living. My skin is so soft afterwards and last forever. I use everyday because of the texture and MOSTLY because if its scent. I get told I smell like the beach all the time. And the glow it leaves your skin is priceless. I recieved this product complimentary from influenster. I will be buying this product in the future no doubt.,1
Shade and light palette works beautifully. You don't need to much product the contour shade are super pigmented and I barely tap my brush into the shades and they go on so nicely you can still blend them out. The highlight shades are super creamy too!!,0
"SHeer but buildable, unbudge-able, natural finish, does not emphasize dry patches, pretty much undetectable.  Water and sweat proof.  Super long wearing. I am 59, lines, oily skin, redness on cheeks and nose from windburn and exfoliation, some age spots and uneven pigmentation. This foundation justs evens the playing field and takes a good decade off without anyone knowing I am wearing anything on my skin, which is really important to me because I am a man who works with the public under cruel florescent lights.",3
"Sheets really retain their moisture, take off the ick, and smell fantastic. Good for after the gym, a quick afternoon refresher, or even those days when you overslept and there's no time to shower. I will never be without these again. (Note: DON'T use on your face! The peppermint would sting like crazy.)",3
"She's a beautiful, velvet finish foundation.  I have normal skin and I can wear this with or without primer and still have a gorgeous finish.  This is NOT an oily product even though it is a tinted face oil.  You do need to be careful and shake this well before application.  This applies well with a brush, fingers, or a sponge.  Coverage can be built up somewhat.  This wears well all day and does not oxidize.  I purchased Shade 3, but it's a smidge too dark for me.  I will be replacing with Shade 2.  I found the Shade Finder on here didn't work for me so I created a shade comparison of some other brands I had on hand.  For reference, I am also a shade Porcelain in Too Faced Dewy.",3
"Shisheido killed it with this new foundation! It's a natural finish medium coverage foundation that lasts through a 12 hour work shift! I prefer to apply any foundation with a damp beautyblender and this foundation applies beautifully. I self tan so I use many shades of foundations and even mix frequently but the undertone of this shade is perfect! I definitely recommend this for a long wearing natural foundation.\nswatches include: shisheido shade 160 shell, dior 1n, MUF r230, Pur ln6, smith&cult 130",1
"Similarly to the Lines Away serum I'm also testing out, this product will definitely take more than a few trials to see results, especially when it comes to hyperpigmentation! That being said, I've yet to see any drastic changes with the uses I've experienced, but can attest to the brightness it gives my skin the following morning! If you're looking for an easily incorporable serum into your routine, I'd try this one out! \n\n#YSLBeautygiftedme #OctolyFamily",0
"Simple scrub that leaves a hint of color. If had actually received the related lip oil, likely would be five-star; did not, nor any customer service in THREE attempts. Note: works best with moistened lips to start.",2
"simple, small and pretty. amazing product, but the amount u get for the cost is minimal\n I guess that is how they are marketing now. less money then the face oils so we will buy, less product. won't use this everyday just on special occasions",3
"Since I started wearing makeup, I always wanted one of those. They look so beautiful on a vanity and the product looks and feels dreamy. I finally got my hands on one during one of the sephora sales. I loved the way it made my skin look but I realized quickly that it is not meant to be used as a setting powder. It is slightly shimmery and works better as a finishing powder. Shade medium worked well on my NC20 skin",0
Since IT cosmetics stopped selling powder with SPF I ordered this. I like it fine but it doesn't have coverage like IT. The price is a bit steep for the small amount. The refill was the better bargain and now it's off this site. \nI'm starting to wonder if these spf make-up products are actually doing the job since I seem to have more sun spots than ever before. I use SPF in morning and the powder for continued coverage later in the day.  I can always buy another brand with a more reasonable price if the SPF in this product is not working. I guess I will look for another spf powder since the refill product is gone. I dont want to spend an extra $20 on a brush I won't use.,2
"Since the product was changed to sharpening, it's been an awful product.  The sharpener eats half the pencil and it doesn't even sharpen it properly! I will be changing my eyeliner to another brand. (the older version with an attached sharpener was a much better product and lasted much longer)",0
"Since they changed the formula and price of the white lucent I transitioned to this day cream. I do really like it, it's very creamy and I am moisturized all day. It's my go to for daily use after the transition. It is a bit heavier of a cream but a little bit goes a long way!",0
"Skin has seen a dramatic difference. I do use chemical exfoliators regularly, but it wasn't until I added this retinol to my skin care routine that my skin has all but completely cleared and smoothed out the texture of my skin, so much so that I'm actually wearing less makeup. No irritation. Overall wonderful product.",4
Skin was tired and dry due to stress and winter.  Slapped this on before bed and it made my skin plump and happy.  Not sure about the brightening as it was just one treatment but will definitely repurchase.,2
smaller than I expected however it sure lasts because it is such good product! The cream is so moisturizing and the eye cream is nice for brightening. I love the face wash! It is minty and fresh! Cleans your face very well with no pore blocking.,1
"Smells amazing. Few drops into your palm, gently pat onto your face right after a shower. My skin feels ""wet"" again and serves as a great step 1 before serum(s) and moisturizer. Effective and very comparable price point.",1
"Smells amazing.  Nice big bottle, plenty of product.  Does absolutely nothing for my hair. I have lots of long fine wavy hair. I have given up on trying to get it to work in my hair. But I use it as a linen spray.",3
"smells heavenly, looks beautiful. a bit drying and fades weirdly, leaving dreaded lip ring. also must completely remove before reapplication or else it is clump city. but the color is so beautiful I cant help but like it. I MUCH prefer this one to the gingerbread girl one, which always looks dark brown on me no matter how lightly I apply.",4
Smells Like Candy Canes/Lolipops. I've only used it twice but I'm not sure how long it's going to last. Because it's so thick it takes a little bit to put on your face and they reccomend using 2-3 times a week. If anything it might last about a month and that's it. It seems a bit pricey so I took a star away from that and a star away because you don't get much. Overall if your looking for a nice clay mask I would reccomend this.,0
Smells nice and isn’t sticky. Smoothes on nicely. I can’t say I notice a huge difference in my skin but overall it feels a little more even and less redness that I notice. I appreciate the good ingredients.,0
Smells really good and goes on light. This is a different texture than a lot of moisturizers - I can actually feel the moisture but it doesn't leave my skin looking greasy as it dries quickly. I have dry skin so it says to layer with another cream based moisturizer if needed.,0
"smells SO GOOD! no fake tan smell at all. just the watermelon. have only used for two days but have a healthy glow, and I know it's working because I didnt follow instructions and wash my hands after use, had tan marks on my finger webbing:')",0
"Smells wonderful, stays put, has a light shimmer making you look sun kissed and dewy. Need hardly any highlighter with this product. Only thing I'd change is that it isn't very pigmented, but even so it's buildable to get the right shade. I'm very fair and it's the perfect shade for me without making it look like I just ran a marathon.\n\nTLDR: it goes on like a dream, smells sweet and peachy (saving me perfume), and is the perfect shade, but could use more pigment.",0
"Smudges badly.  The fine tip is great and the product glides on so smooth and precise, but after a few hours it was all over the place.  Maybe it depends on the color but I was disappointed with the truffle shade smearing.",4
"Snapshot -- sensitive, dry to normal, hyper-reactive skin; redness around cheeks, nose, chin; post-menopausal(!), so, not a spring chicken. Was looking for a pH neutral or lower cleansing milk -- this is foaming, so not that -- but I checked out the texture in store and gave it a shot. I love this.  It cleans my skin without leaving it tight or leaving residue behind.  The few days I wear makeup anymore, it does a great job of removing makeup remover.  I usually go for something creamier in winter, but this will do well year round.  It doesn't exacerbate my tendency (worse after menopause) for redness.  Gentle enough for eyes, too.  It's a keeper.",3
"So beautiful! I love the colour story here. The mattes are silky and pigmented. The glitter/shimmers although absolutely stunning are something you have to play with... some work better foiled, while others are best applied with your finger. Just a little finicky that way which is a little annoying but that is my only complaint. Packaging and layout is stunning!!!!",2
"So cute. So soft and spongy. What a good deal! \n\nThey look like real erasers and are so adorable next to the brushes that look like pencils. I love collecting the Moschino + Sephora merchandise. They look great on the Vanity and make cute gifts.\n\nI have already repurchased this item as a backup. And would recommend these sponges to others. I normally use a Beauty blender, but I have been reaching for this eraser sponge everyday for the last week to apply my liquid foundation.",2
so disappointed.  colours are not true. They have a very brown undertone that comes through in every instance.  they dont blend and are very chalky.  I normally love.tarte but this palette is not up to the normal standard.,4
"SO disappointed. Received this free from Influenster, and was actually going to buy this myself seeing it in the store. First of all, I am a huge fan of ABH. These shades are not flattering at all. They definitely look like concealer on your lips. The only shades that were flattering were just peachy and on mute. Very disappointed",0
So disappointing. It goes on so dark. and as it ages it only gets darker. I've had this for idk 4 months and it's almost completely dried up. I keep the lid on I store it well. It is such a waste of money.,0
"So disappointing. This is a brazen rip-off of the incredible  ""Blue Cocoon Beauty Balm"" from May Lindstrom Skin. Except it's fully of unnatural ingredients and fillers and is nowhere near as effective.  Don't waste your money on this, save up for the real thing, which isn't that much more expensive per ounce.",1
so every time I do my brows I use a pencil that feels the easiest for me to use but after trying this brow styler I have made a decision not to go back it was so easy for me to shape my brows and fill them in without getting messy. This is my new go to!,0
"So excited to be one of the first to try this new product from Smashbox before it's released! Thank you for this complimentary gift!\n\n-This lip oil is absolutely AMAZING! It is so much better than any chapstick or lip care product for healing that I've tried. #ComeOnWinter \n\n-This Primer Serum does not leave my face greasy.

So excited to have found this powder. I tend to buy higher end brands but have been less than satisfied. This is exactly what I want in a powder. Does not leave my face feeling sticky and lasts all day. Does not appear powdery on my aging skin. The brush is weak but who cares...,2
"So far I am loving this product. I am falling asleep much more quick and I wake up looking more refreshed than normal. I am interested in how using this long term will make me feel, considering I'm on week 2 of using it currently.",0
"So far, I am really enjoying this product! It foams up easily and doesn't irritate my skin. I tend to break out from a lot of products, and this didnt make me break out. I can tell it's part of the clean at sephora section by the way my skin feels. Korres is also cruelty free, although they had a weird thing going on for a little where they were going to sell in China and that would have potentially changed that status but as of 2/2019 they are 100% cruelty free and will be staying on my radar! I really enjoy that this cleanser doesnt have much of a fragrance as fragrance really bothers me. I recieved this as a complimentary product from influenster in exchange for testing/reviewing! I really appreciate them sending this my way!",4
"So far I’m loving the product, I’m getting married in a week. I went to sephora to try and calm down my skin in preparation for the big day. This product has done wonders! My dark spots are lightening and I definitely have a glow to my skin that wasn’t there before. I think that adding this into my skin routine-will be a lasting but habit!",0
"So far so good. I've used all of the products. I'm really looking it all so far. I used the night serum with the face oil as recommended and little to no tingling. Acne is going away. I've been waking up with a glowier complexion. My eyes haven't been as dry. I'm only a couple of days in so I haven't noticed my under eye circles going away yet. However, I do think it will help. I'm very satisfied with these products.",4
So far so good!  I've used this for about 5 days.  So far I've noticed the fine lines towards the side of my face soften some.  My skin also appeared a bit brighter and smoother.  Application is easy.  No peeling or sensitive skin.   Retinol provides cumulative results so I'm excited to see how more time and usage will affect my skin.  It's definitely worth a try!,1
"So far this is my least favorite Sol de Janeiro product that I've tried. I really hate how the bright yellow pigment leaves residue on your skin after using. It also makes a mess in the shower and you have to rinse the tub after using so it doesn't stain. It does have the signature scent, but I prefer to stick to the lotion, it's just not the same. Didn't leave my skin feeling amazing after. I wish they would reformulate or remove this product from the line entirely.",1
"So fine, so thin, so perfect! I've had this brush for 14 months now and it's the only one I reach for-even if I travel it goes where I go and stays close by. No carry on for this one it goes straight in my purse.",4
"So first off, I have really sensitive eyes and suffer from dry eye and most mascaras make me tear up. I received this with a sample set and wasn't even checking for it, tbh, being that I have pretty much given up on mascaras completely. Well, I've been using this for 2 weeks and I'm impressed. It stays on pretty much smudge free all day and I have yet to have any sensitivity issues. It darkens my lashes and separated them without any clumping. I already have long lashes but always had volume issues and this does the trick. It also helps curl them a bit. I have very straight lashes and this gives them a nice curve. Now, this isn't a mega volume, false lash-look miracle, but it does what it needs to do for me. It's perfect for regular, every day wear where you don't need a dramatic lash. Though I haven't tried to layer it on past two coats, so maybe? If you want Snufalufagus lashes, this won't be your bag. But if you want pretty, supple, darkened and separated lashes with some volume and curl, that's long wearing and won't irritate your eyes, this is your mascara.",4
"Softened my skin and absolutely made my fine lines and wrinkles lighter and less deep. However i hesitate to use it because it also makes my skin look a lot paler and takes sunless tanning lotion right off as well. I don’t know if this has something to do with the Asian market where it’s from and the skin lightening craze over there, but I don’t like my skin to look lighter. It makes me look anemic.",2
"So glad I bought this. I get a horrible rash under my armpits, on my bikini line, and up my legs after shaving. I always assumed it was just bad razor burn. I bought this to use as exfoliant on my shoulder and decided to try it on my shaving problems areas. They COMPLETELY cleared up. A little goes a long way, and it is well worth the price.",1
"So glad I finally got this palette! I've had it in and out of my cart at least a few times during the past year (expensive, do I really NEED another eyeshadow palette...), but finally took the plunge.\nThis is a lovely, lovely palette. The shadows apply beautifully and easily. With the exception of a bone matte shade (for setting the eyes), this can definitely be a standalone palette, despite being all satin shadows. They are not so shimmery that the mid-tone shadows couldn't be used as transition shades. In fact, they impart a pretty, glowy (not metallic or glittery) finish, creating an almost ethereal eye look. \nThe shades themselves are a great mix of lighter and deeper shades, in a nice mix of colors.\nWorth the $, especially during sale events!",0
So glad I found this product it's very good for my . My skin looks glowing people always compliment my skin when I wear this product is a must use for. I wear  everyday for work and it looks like a have no make up on. I love it highly highly recommended,4
"So glad I tried the mini size before buying the larger, this is absolutely not worth the money. save yourself and just buy organic coconut oil from the grocery store, the texture is so much better and easy to apply. This oil had a chunky texture, and small bits in it would never melt, they just made a mess of the bathroom as I tried to apply the oil.",2
"So glad I tried this!  I have fair skin and don't notice I am wearing anything.  It doesn't pill and roll-up if I apply powder afterward.  Can hardly tell I have it on.  Doesn't melt off or run into my eyes and sting, even after sweating in the heat.  I will buy this again",2
so good! I absolutely love the whole line from olehenrikson and this is no different.  the bottle is huge and will last a long time.  it smells great and does a good job cleaning my face.  my face felt soft after and not stripped at all.  I will buy this again.,2
"So good! I've been using this for about a week now and my under eyes look brighter, less puffy and much more hydrated. I'm thrilled. makes the fine lines around my eyes look less prominent. very happy so far.",2
"So happy I bought this kit. I've received many compliments each time I wear this. People say it looks flawless and matches my skin well. I wear a couple powders on top, cause I like to set it. Very good coverage and stays 24 hours or so if you wanna party all night. This is a great brand.",4
So HAPPY Sephora carries Dermalogica now!  I used it years ago when my plastic surgeons office carried it.  Dermalogica contain mostly all natural ingredients that work.  This moisturizer is great because it contains a  SPF 50 and I've  had numerous bouts with basal cell on my face so I must wear sunscreen.  Just one pump produces the perfect amount that spreads evenly over your face and neck.  I wake up in my morning and my skin still feels soft and moisturized.  I returned to a full Dermalogica skin care routine this year and stopped trying so many other creams that just didn't do anything no matter how much I paid.,2
"So happy to finally find a hydrating, soothing toner with no added fragrance. In my ignorance, I happy purchased the Fresh Rose Facial Hydrating Toner 2 or 3 times. Then I realized that I was practically just paying a ton of money to irritate my skin with all that fragrance. \n\nMy skin feels great and hydrated after this. If you need some extra hydration, or need to balance out your skin, check this out.",3
"So I actually bought this shade and another one called Vanity from the actual Urban Decay website. The colours themselves and the metallic - ness to them are absolutely gorgeous but thats about it. I tried Vanity last night, within 30 minutes of just talking no eating or drinking I could feel it starting to get abnormally dry. Then it started to flake from the inside outwards, another 30 minutes it was starting to clump together and flake off.  Within an hour and a half I went to the bathroom and with just water wiped it completely off. I only put two coats on and that wasn't really enough product to begin with as it was very patchy. I was really excited to try their liquid lipsticks as their other products are great, but this formula is absolutely disappointing, unless something drastically changes I'll never buy any of their lip products again.",1
So I bought this when sephora had their vib 20% off coupon & I'm glad I did!! This product is nice to your skin. It smells good. it doesn't make you break out & it definitely makes your skin glow! but a botox & filler alternative?!??? (as seen in Vogue) This skincare line is definitely superior but I haven't seen the things it claims to do.,2
"So I got this as a point perk and started using it morning and night a couple days ago and BOY did I jotice a difference in my skin already. I don't have acne, but my pores are quite congested and sometimes turn into bigger breakouts. But my congestion has gone down SO MUCH! i'm very impressed. I've been using the Deep Cleanse in combination with the Caudalie Vinopure Purifying toner and it's been great so far!",0
"So I got this as a sample at first and lemme tell ya, IT'S FOREVER IN MY LIFE. The mask left my skin feeling amazing and I almost died from the smell because it smells so good. It smells good enough to eat (don't eat it though, or do, I don't control you) but either way, after this mask you'll feel so refreshed!",0
So I have been wearing this foundation every day for 3 weeks now. This foundation doesnt last all day. Its beautiful when you first put it on but after 8 hours; some areas will get patchy. It gets really oily in my T-zone. So if you're out and about all day definitely bring blotting paper or  a setting powder. This is medium coverage. I have a lot of texture from acne scars and pigmentation. I've noticed after wearing this everyday my skin has improved a lot. My texture is smoother and I barely have any pigmentation now. So honestly I would give it 5 stars for skincare...but make up rating would be a 3.,0
"so I have NEVER used an entire eye cream - ever. Until this beautiful product. using this daily, morning and night, I noticed a HUGE difference in my undereye, to the point that most days I have been going without eye concealer. I do not have strong, genetic dark circles, but i have the beginnings of fine lines under my eyes as I am nearing 30. this has been a favourite in my routine as I've noticed my eyes becoming dryer over the last many months. no more!",1
"So I have very dark circles that came to me my senior year of high school and hasn't left for two years from the minimal amount of sleep I get, plus having already dry skin I needed something to try that worked. I read the comments and at first decided against buying it but then I went into Sephora and the person who was helping me recommended it so I decided to try it. The reviews I saw said it did nothing but moisturize or that it sat on top of the skin so I was really worried but after a week of using it I've already seen my dark circles and puffiness diminish and it works wonders with hydrating my eyes. I really do recommend especially if you wear makeup a lot cause it also made applying concealer wonderful. 10/10 recommend and will continue to purchase!",0
"So, I kinda like this roll on highlighter! It's definitely a good option for an everyday highlight that you can wear with makeup or without. It's a soft balm like consistency that gives you a really natural, healthy skin kind of glow! Doesn't look ashy on dark skin from trying it!",4
"So I learned about this brand years ago because of Wayne Goss, and decided to try it. I've never looked back since. I have very oily T zones with dry mostly around my face. So combo. I only apply it to my T zones and parts I see little zits pop up. And it honestly it is theee best. I use it every day at night along with my other water base serum and moisturizer and my face is the smoothest it has ever been and honestly for the price why not? Give it a shot if you know you have oily skin and are prone to zits due to the oil.",4
"So, I'll admit it took me a couple tries to get used to this kind of brush, but once I mastered it I fell in love with this mascara. It lengthens my lashes, makes them look fuller and doesn't weigh them down like other mascaras I've tried. Nothing's worse than curling your lashes and then having a heavy mascara uncurl them. That's not a problem with this mascara. Love it and would totally recommend it.",2
"So I love this product. It really helps with my oily skin and I have bought it several times now. The one thing that really annoys me is that it breaks so easily and makes a mess in your purse. This has happened to me so many times now and it’s getting pretty annoying to have to keep buying a new one because of how easily it breaks just being in your purse. For the price, you’d think it would last it’s full term.",0
"so in love with Natasha Denona's palettes. Her palettes are so creamy and easy to blend. not to mention, the formula is the best and the pigmentation is the best, for I can't get enough of her eyeshadows. I have almost all of them despite the price but well worth it even tho I have to splurge to get one at a time but soooo worth it in my opinion. I absolutely love them all!! I recommend to buy them if its ur last dallar (after all of ur Bill's are paid tho lol) these are a must have",2
"so I ordered this set and here's my review\n\n1. bum bum cream - smalls amazing and it's very rich, thick. and had an oily shine to it. dont know if it will actually do anything other than moisturize\n\n2. lip balm - not great smelling. kinda waxy. bot the best. I wouldn't have bought this alone after smelling it in the sephora store. \n\n3. coco cream - less thick than the bum hum cream. better for all over moisturizing. smells like a coconut shake. \n\n4. shower cream gel - smells like a vacation. nice rich and thick. good for shaving legs. \n\nthe sizes are small so try these if u dont wanna spend the 50+ dollars for bum bum cream alone without trying it...",4
so I thought that I was going to love this palette the colors are so pretty but once you try to put them on there not very pigmented it's really hard to get them to go on good. I used I shadow primer I tried using concealer I tried using it wet and I just couldn't get the colors to go on good and overall there was really only three colors that I like. very disappointed with this palette.... I took it back and got a refund.,2
"So it's no secret that these are a CULT classic but it's not until I bought that I FINALLY understood the hype. Upon ONE usage my skin felt so smooth, bright and supple! I've been using this for about 1.5 months now (every other day) and I've been enjoying it! My texture, congestion and hyperpigmentation (darkening) have DRASTICALLY faded ( I also use the Volition Vit C Serum and the Dermalogica Prisma protect SPF)! it creates  fine lather and I've also noticed my pores are less visible! 15/10 MUST GRAB!",0
"So I’ve been using this product EVERY morning since it first came out and I’m obsessed. I can tell a huge difference in the texture and look of my skin. I tend to have a lot of redness in my t zone and a few melasma spots on my forehead and the sides of my cheeks and these have drastically improved since using this serum. Your skin will immediately glow and feel super plump after applying this serum and it’s the perfect consistency, not too creamy and not too watery so it feels great under your makeup. I most definitely recommend this product!",0
so I was using retinol & my skin was peeling badly & I tried this mask..I must say what a magic this mask did..my skin become so soft & smooth & all the dryness & flakiness just vanish..also I love the size of this sheet mask it just sits perfectly all over my face & its not sticky at all after removing..I highly recomend this mask if u have dry itchi flaky skin ♥️,4
So Many people are disliking this product. However I had NO Issues with it!!! Infact I Enjoyed it!!! I used it on the corners of my lids and along with another eyeshadow which was Glittery it Blended so perfect!! Atleast I thought!!! Its Beautiful!!!,3
Somehow matte but lightweight. This is such great find and after the summer I've pulled it out again. I would like to have a few colours to use as highlighting and natural shades to blend out all over (please see Katie Jane Hughes!) So underrated! I have dry skin and this is not drying - not even under the eyes.,2
"someone posted a 1 star review about cruelty free and how this product is prob mass sold in China. to clarify it's a korean product and animal testing is prohibited so I feel like if negative review are gonna be written they shld do their research first. second, i gave it 5 stars since my sister lives for this. I don't like the tackiness of it. reminds me of belief gel moisturizer or the one from Tarte. I have dry aging skin and this  eventually absorbed all into my skin but took a while. I can see how it wld remain tacky for other.",2
"some people were saying it was transparent and you had to layer it , which works if you want super gold. For me it was application . Also just letting it dry first . I got alot of gold in one swipe . but had to let it dry out without touching it.  , it takes a while to dry. it also blends out very beautifully for a different look.",1
Some say this is easily duped and similar to the other Huda pallets.....I dont think that at all!! Each shade is unique and different to me ....and the way they work together and blend is satisfying and beautiful! I'm so glad I bought this pallet. I think it's my new favorite next to my ND Metropolis pallet. The shimmers are so unique to me and different from others. If this matters I'm not a person who follows or knows much about Huda herself.....I'm just a lover of makeup!,4
SOMETHING HAPPENED to this once great product that I have been using for years!!  This is the first time I purchased this product  in the new Laura Mercier tube!  I thought it would be fine and put it away while I used up the rest of the tube I already had.  I started this one about a week ago. All seemed fine.  Then today when I went to use it...IT CAME OUT ORANGEY!  What the heck?  I have used this same product in Bare Radiance for years!  Never has this happened! The tube is tsillnew and yet the color of the product changed on me for God knows what reason.I shook ti and tapped it to see if it had settled or???? Nothing! still orange>  See photo! Original....and new - Bare Radiance.  Absolutely HORRIBLE!  NOW WE HAVE TO TRY TO FIND THIS PRODUCT in some other way because laura mercier has done something to change the formula and watch out...the color will switch on you!  I am sending it back for a full refund! SO UPSET!!,2
"Sometimes a girl just needs to sparkle - and this product went there.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn't quite what i was looking for when I bought it for my mom. The description reads : ""The micro-fine, jet-milled powder applies seamlessly for a get-noticed glow without glitter."" I was really hoping for a more subtle glow that she can wear to work. She loves my Becca highlighter for that reason. This Marc Jacob's highlighter is beautiful, but its all sparkle. \n\nWe will have to return it and hopefully find something more pearlescent rather than foil.",0
"so much better than the 5% aha prism! I have very dry and sensitive skin, and it doesn't irritate it even though it is a stronger formula. With the old prism I didn't like the consistency of the product, it was too watery and didn't feel right, this one has a gorgeous feel when applying it's almost like a serum. I'm able to use this one every second night to really allow it to do what it does uninterrupted, and I have to say that my skin is looking so much better than with the 5% serum. Never switching to anything else!",0
sooo disappointed about this product. i have been loving fresh's masks and the scents are outstanding!!! like WOW i love the rose and black tea set.... unfortunately i have been braking out SO BAD. i have been using it for 2 weeks; now i have a penny sized pimple that wont go away and acne all over my neck and forhead. although i love the smells i think my sensitive skin does not. great price point and very hydrating... just not for acne prone !!,1
"SOOO, happy with this product. It gives you the option to do a soft brow or a defined brow(or both.) It is super easy to use and long lasting. I was a bit hesitant about the powder but it creates a soft brow that gives an easy & breezy look. Totally recommend purchasing!!",1
"Soooooo the threading or whatever you call it on the bottle sucks. Its doesnt let you close the bottle tightly and it leaks and many people have noted this fact in reviews. Dr Dennis Take note and repackage this great product.  So then air gets into the product and turns it a dark orange which happens over time with a normal product, but this happens ten times as fast because there is something wrong with the bottle.   That said,  when I had them send me a new one (same bottle issue AGAIN) but the second time mine hadn't turned in color yet- it works AMAZING.  But dont try to travel with this because the product leaks out... I basically have to keep it standing straight up and put in a ziplock bag to keep it fresh.   Too bad because in and of itself the product is good but it turns so quickly due to the really bad packaging.   It did indeed lighten my pigment",1
"So perfect, smooth, non cakey, blendable, natural, hydrating, perfect (did I say that already?) and... expensive :( I had a sample and I can't justify buying the full size but the formula is out of this world. Maybe one day. Sigh. I'm fair neutral-warm btw, with a bit of blue under my eyes but no intense dark circles.",1
"So refreshing!!! I use this as a toner after I wash my face, and also occasionally through out the day just because it feels so good. I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes, and was so happy to get it! this is definitely one of my new favorite products!",1
"so refreshing, sprays on unlike any other mist. I bought the mini and lasted me probably almost 2 months with daily use. nice scent. reallly makes you feel fresh and does wonders applying over make up too. will purchase again and again. fresh has become in my top 3 favorite brands",4
"Sort of a requirement during the harsh dry winter and a habit of lip licking.  It did take a moment to get used to the stick form and consistency.   Made the mistake once of carrying the trial size in my pocket.  When I went to use it, it was a goopy melted mess!  Aside from that, I'm sold.",2
"so sad. i LOVE the black tea scent, started with the mask so i wanted to expand and try other products from this line. unfortunately this mask is not for acne prone skin... broke out royaly.. so although it smells wonderful the perfume may cause irritation.",1
"So SAD of a Pallet, and with a name which is Known for High QUALITY, and as PRESTIGIOUS as the Brand is, you would think they'd be EMBARRASSED to put out a Pallet this Aweful!!! REALLY, Were talking Dollar Store Quality, (Childs makeup set!) QUALITY!!! I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE IT, But for the price. AND ALL of the OTHER PALLETS out there which costs half as much yet SO MUCH BETTER!!! THIS PALLET is just a Marketing Pallet I Feel, as if they just put it together Last minute without any sort of research on the shadows themselves!!! Not Worth the Price, let alone the TIME inwhich you'll be wasting to send it back!!! A NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS Sums up this Aweful Pallet!!!",3
So sad right now!  Just got mine today and opened it to find it is all dried out and hard. No longer a gel.  I tried using it anyway to see and it barley spreads and it is flakey.   Now I have to go through the hassle of returning.   DISAPPOINTMENT.,2
"So so so hydrating. I have dehydrated skin, dry patches and flakiness. But I am still oily in the t-zone. This has been such a help, great for dehydrated skin. I use this after toner, before my night moisturizers and I wake up with plump, soft, supple skin. Always a repurchase!",0
"So so so stunning. This palette can create very ""safe"" looks, but also create some creative and colourful looks. The shades are more complimentary thank you think, and pairing the glitter on top of other shades is so transformative. I have to say this is one of my favourites from Huda",0
"So stricky.\nFirstly, it felt like the glove was sinking more product and I needed to use a lot of product to get it on all my body. I also thought I had applied it evenly everywhere, however once the color had developed, it was so off, where whole areas on my arms and legs were not tanned. I give 2 stars for the color it gave off.",0
"So stunningly beautiful, I use this on the high points of my face before I apply my foundation. it gives you the lit from within look! I also have this in shade 4 and honestly it really doesn't make a different, it blends out and doesn't make my fair skin look weird. My holy grail Charlotte Tilbury product.  The only qualm I have with it is the packaging, I don't like the applicator, it's basically a ginormous concealer applicator lol. But in the end it's worth it.",1
So super oily feeling and it never absorbs just gets on pillowcases and everywhere else.  I immediately noticed tons of blackheads a day after I first tried it and then again almost a week later when trying it a second time.  I also have a huge pimple developing now as well.  No thanks theres much better products to choose from that dont do this.,4
"So the finishing powder aspect of this is great! It has good coverage and is light on the skin.  BUT... it is a MESS! Every single time I use it, it gets all over my vanity and my clothes.  I wish it came in a pressed powder version.  I just don't have time to clean up powder or change my clothes every time I use it!",2
so thick so creamy so perfect for my under eyes and their needs. I use only at night as directed and the benefits are moisturized plump skin. no more dull lifeless undereyes. I put any extra on my finger rubbed over my lips. no fragrance or chemical smell or taste.,1
"So this baby is small, hence why it's called the 'baby' buki. It's dense so it picks up putty and cream highlighters with ease and it's small so you can highlight your cheek and brown one without getting highlighter everywhere. I bought this so I could use the diamond bomb and the Laura Mercier face illuminator, and it works PERFECTLY. I'll use it everyday ☺️",0
So this brush head is pretty rough but not too rough so people with sensitive skin might not want this but i'm very oily and this made my skin feel SO soft and smooth even after the first use. I love this!,3
"So this was beyond disappointing for me! Its so disappointing it drives me crazy especially since I wanted this so badly and was really hyped up for the release of this collection! You see this type of product with such a unique collection you see how beautiful it is how could you resist!? It is so beautiful in the pan with the design if only this had some pigment to it this would be perfect! Its basically just pink glitter with no pigment or shimmer to it. Did they make it intentionally unpigmented to only make a collector's item? I really want to know. If you're a collector then by all means you do you and enjoy this product but for me, I can't justify $51 on a highlighter that will just sit there and be pretty but I can't use it.  Sadly I had to say goodbye to the pretty sugar skull and send her back to Sephora :(",1
"So to start I have to mention I used these both ways. I have tried them after refrigeration and without. Refrigeration is crucial because they stick to your skin better and it feels better. They slip a lot more if they're not chilled. To those complaining about the fit, I have to say these are the best fitting eye mask I ever purchased. But everyone's eyes are shaped differently and these are easily adjustable. You can cut them if you need to or move them around. They slip a tiny bit when you first put them on but all you have to do is move them back into place, once they set they stay. If they're constantly slipping it's most likely user error or they weren't chilled. They feel great and are very relaxing. I noticed a reduction in wrinkles and dark circles. I noticed that people expect instant difference after using these and it doesn't work like that with skin care products. You have to use them on a regular basis to be able to tell if it's working. I enjoy them and they work well for me. I'm definitely going to repurchase them, they have become a part of my skin care routine and they're a pleasure to use.",2
"So when I first got this moisturizer I wasnt to fond of it ,I  didnt see much of a difference  with  my  acne and  I felt it left my skin a little dry  in some areas BUT when I decided to give it anouther chance a few weeks later I had a completely different experience.. my skin is softer and much much  more clear, I have mostly oily skin so for the most part it does really well  and leaves my skin soft, but in my couple dry areas I use just a tad of extra moisturizing moisturisers and it works great!  definitely definitely helping my break outs  on my chin that I just cant seem to get rid of! so 100% would recommend this, I'd just say stick to it to see better results! \n\nalso I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review",0
"so wonderful!! I'm always searching for the next great lip balm. I have chronic dry lips. I bought this after trying few times in store. I now have 2. one for my bag, and one that lives in my car. I may end up with a 3rd for bedside. can't get enough.",2
sparkle galore! I'm 50 and was a little hesitant to purchase something this sparkly. I really like it though. it's pricey but if you want the glitter w/out the grit this lipstick is for you. I will be purchasing another color but haven't decided which color yet.,3
"spectacular moisturizer. it's really one of the best hyaluronic acid products I've used for my super dry skin. the cleanser is good too, as is the serum, though I haven't been using the serum long enough to see results.",0
"Stardust is such a beautiful color! I love wearing this all over my eyelids; it has such a beautiful effect and is so unique looking. Works beautifully as a highlighter, on my lids or even as a lip topper. I have very oily skin, but this product did not disturb my foundation or other makeup that I wore underneath it. Definitely glad I purchased this. Highly recommend!!",1
"Started using Tatcha The Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream as part of my skin care routine at the first of the month. First impressions: the packaging is super nice, the lid had a flower design inlaid in it which is a beautiful touch. The product felt very smooth and cooling when applied around my eyes and my skin felt super moisturized after it soaked it. It's super easy to apply and a little goes a long way from what I can tell. 2 weeks later, I'm loving the product. The skin around my eyes stays moisturized and so soft. Absolutely love it! I did receive this product from Influenster to try out for an unbiased review.",4
"Started using this a few months and had no issues or breakouts. I was using it in conjunction with the toner, Buffet, and moisturizer and my skin looked amazing but not sure what impact this had because like I said, I was using it with other products. I stopped using it for a few months and started using it again a couple weeks ago and my skin has broken out horribly around my mouth, chin and jaw. Painful pimples and my skin looks like a disaster. Gave it a couple weeks in case my skin was ""purging"" but it just continues to get worse so I'm throwing the rest out.",1
"Stayed on all day even though my eyes were watering horribly from allergies. Coverage was just what I wanted - brightened my dark hollows, covered my slight discolouration. Wasn't like putty. \nI normally use IT bye bye undereye because it fills in everything, but this was far easier to use and much faster. \nI have sensative skin so I love clinique.\nI got as a sample but will be buying a tube.",3
Staying power! It lasts all day even through eating and drinking.  My lips don't have the drying cracked look but the product in the bottle is so dry and hardening I don't believe that it will last long.,2
"stays on all day/night. this is probably my favorite liner to use if i know im gonna be out all day in a concert/festival, because it stays put! i do like the applicator as well, it reminds me of kvd, so the application is a breeze.",1
Sticky. Very sticky. I use it at a spot treatment at night only because it doesn't dry down very well. It doesn't play nicely with other products if you use too much. It's a decent serum but i won't be repurchasing..i feel like i can find something similar that doesn't feel so heavy.,1
Stop with the negative reviews! \n\nI got a make over done at Sephora. The makeup artist found my shade and she used setting powder. A little goes a long way this is also a buildable foundation.\n\n I wore it for 7 hours and it lasted. I wore it 16 hours and it still looked fabulous. I have combination skin I did get a little oily I blotted and my face looked fresh. I got a sample and put it on I got many compliments on this foundation. You can use this foundation with or without primer I think you definitely must use a setting powder.  Looks natural or you can glam it up.   I ended up purchasing this foundation and I really like it. \n\nI think it should be 30ml and it is expensive that's why I gave it a four star.,4
"Struggling from redness/kp all over my body, I have been using this everywhere for quality control. This really smooths out the uneven texture I have had for a while. After a few uses, the redness/kp has definitely reduced. I follow with a hydrating moisturizer to lock in moisture. Easy to use, very pleasant skin afterwards!",0
Stunning and pictures do not do it justice.  if you ever wanted to buy a palette of hers now is the time.  I hope she keeps them in this format because it is affordable.  Her formula has absolutely no fallout and blends beautifully.,3
"Stunning palette in terms of colours and blends like a dream. Some of the shades, like Sponsored, are so unique I hope that ABH considers making them singles. I am pretty fair (an NC20, I think) and I have no issues using this in terms of colours being too dark or bold. You can do some great neutral looks as well as bolder ones. If you can blend your transition shade properly you don't actually need a light matte brow bone shade - it's not a requirement for every look. Highly recommend.",3
"Such a beautiful color and it's very intense in color my only problem with it is after packing it tightly in my make up box for an air plane trip it shattered crumbled in broke.. still usable, still love, but now I gotta be extra careful and really tap the brush to release the extra product.... so either I fudged up or this product is highly delicate!",4
"Such a beautiful wash of colour on my medium skin tone. Really light, watery texture but applies well with a brush or damp Beauty blender onto the apples of the cheek. Lovely sheen with no sparkle. There's so much in the bottle that I feel like I'll never run out! Perfect year round.",2
Such a cute blush and highlighter! This is my first Natasha Denona product and I'm impressed with this glow duo. The blush is a sheer soft buildable pink. I like the blush. The highlighter is just average. I will use it but Becca highlights are way better.,2
"Such a great formula, and the price is a steal for this a full size lipstick and the lipliner. \nI love this set, the lipstick formula is just amazing so comfortable and long wearing. I have a medium skin complexion, and this color is a perfect nude!",1
such a silky smooth and beautiful color. it has amazing color pay off and it looks great but it isn't ideal for anyone with the least bit of wrinkles whatsoever and I can't stand the smell but otherwise overall great for someone who doesn't mind it. I recieved this as a complimentary gift,1
Such a smooth lip gloss with just the right amount of sheen. I don't even need a lip pencil it applies so effortlessly and doesn't creep or accentuate my lip lines. Feels so nice on my lips and the color Faux Real is the perfect compliment to my natural lip color. Love PML glosses and the VIB sale is a great time to stock up!,4
"Such a smooth, satin finish, feels moisturizing (don't think that's its job). As per luxury makeup, price to product ratio feels like a dupe but for the pigmentation and payoff, it's worth it, such a lovely warm brown on my tan skin! A treat putting it on :)",0
"Sucked me right in with the packaging, but the formula of the balm itself is awful. Mineral oil? Come on, it's 2019. Time for manufacturers to stop using certain ingredients just because they're cheap. It's not that hard to make a cheap lip balm with better ingredients.",2
"Sumptuous balm... happy I bought this, though I baked at the price, this takes lip moisturizing up a notch. After a very busy summer with lots of outdoor time, I noticed how dry my lips were and pronounced pucker lines on my top lip. Two days of applying this product and I already feel a difference.  My parched lips heaved a sigh of relief!",3
"Sunday Riley products will change your life! My face is really dry in the winter and I'm in need of exfoliation without fail. The great thing about the Luna product, is that it exfoliates, but leaves a subtle oil behind that eventually soaks in and makes your face amazingly soft. Since my skin is also sensitive, I only use the A  product once a week, due to its strength. Overall, I give this boxed set an enthusiastic double thumbs up!",2
Super amazing product. it has a natural look with medium coverage. no creasing! and I crease with mostly every concealer. super recommend it. \xa0“I received this product complimentary from\xa0Giorgio Armani for sampling purposes.”,2
"super hydrating, smells great, 1 pump covers my whole face! I use this as a base primer. I have found that since I have oily skin, this alone does not cut it. this helps illuminate my face and refresh my complexion but it does not blur out pores or keep the oil that builds up throughout the day from blotching my makeup.\n\nSo I use this under a blur-type primer like the YSL blur or even under Becca's velvet blurring primer. The primer combination locks my makeup on my face, hides my pores, keeps my skin fresh/hydrated. Definitely would recommend!",4
Super moisturizing but not sticky or slimy. It stays put pretty well so it’s nice for bed (trying to read after is usually my test). You can see the brightness it adds almost immediately. Feels like you're putting pearl dust on your eyes. Solid eye cream. Haven’t used long enough for real results but I’ve loved it is far,0
Super rich color that definitely lasted a while. I did feel like it was a bit bright for me as a pale person. I needed very little and a lot of blending to make it look right on my skin. I received this product for free for testing purposes,1
"Super satiny feel on the lips, not slippery or drying, very comfortable plus it lasts through at least 3 cups of coffee or cocktails before it starts to fade. The shade of red isn't too over the top or too dull and grandmaish. I absolutely love it!",4
"super saturated color that is easy to apply. goes on like a balm and looks incredible. it is NOT glossy. it has a soft shine but I prefer that. the only real complaint I have is that my lips get dry after wearing the lipstick for a few hours, which is weird given its balm texture. luckily this shade fades gracefully through the day and slightly stains my lips to a rosy color so even if I dont apply it doesnt look embarrassing. the pros definitely outweigh the cons, I'm considering buying another one in a different shade.",4
"Sure, this cute little towel will eventually get your makeup off... but only after scrubbing the living heck out of your skin. But so would sandpaper or a pumice stone, which is what it felt like I used after using this, when it finally started to remove my eye makeup. This actually left the skin around my eyes so irritated for a few days after I used it ONCE, that I had to use concealer to cover up the red raw irritations that it left behind! I'm sticking to my oil based makeup removers, because at least then I know that my skin won't come off with SOME of my makeup! Don't waste your money on this ridiculous little towel (especially if you have sensitive skin!)!",1
"Surprising Little Gem! That beautiful light purple has a shimmer but is matte, never had a shadow like this before, the rest are all really pretty! I took 1-star away because the formula has definitely changed. I'm not a fan of ABH anymore everything is rushed now and you can tell in the quality. If you looking for something decent with a few pops of color you will like this.",1
surprisingly I my face wasn't super shiny even being outside in the sun most of my day. even wore it when it was super humid during the rainy season in Hawaii! it does kind of crease into my smile lines when I smile a lot.,0
"take this for what it is- an amazing makeup prep product. would I use it overnight or on no makeup days? probably not, I have more deeply hydrating options that my skin needs. but on days when i need to wear makeup that will last all day and also not make me a slip and slide, this is it chief. when working on clients, I like to put a thicker layer on dry patches and after a few minutes use a qtip/cotton pad to remove the dead skin and leave gorgeous supple skin",0
"Talk about a bargain!  These multi-purpose colors are so beautiful and the formula is really good quality.  I love using these as blush, lipstick and eyeshadows or even highlighters.  Great value at the sale price.",3
"Tatcha says it will deliver heatjy drink of hydration & dewy glow w just 1 use. It does, sort of. The good: there's a lot of liquid product, skin feels dewy - but I can't put makeup on after this mask, I might use it before bed?? I used extra liquid on hands (they feel amazing), neck & chest. The Bad: face is still tingling 30 mins after taking off, it also made face & neck red. I don't like the sticky feeling on face, neck, chest - really it just feels tacky and gross, like outdoor exerecising with thick sunscreen on at the beach gross. But the hands soaked up liquid. Tatcha should put this in a hand mask, I would buy that, but not this. I will stick with Amorepacific, which has always delivered on promises.",3
"Texture wise, this primer is like silk. It feels wonderful. \nBut I feel it tries to be the FAB Coconut moisturizing primer but fails. \nThe shimmers are not subtle at all and cling to the texture on my face, peach fuzz etc making the application very uneven. Even after applying foundation you could see random spots of shimmers on my face. \nNot a fan.",2
"Thank you Pat McGrath for making a modern old school foundation. This one does not drain every ounce of moisture from my skin. Stays true to color and wears long. It looks natural; like real skin. And that is truth. This is not the typical heavy concealer in a bottle that has plagued retail foundations for the past 5   years. The coverage is buildable, but you might need to reach for an actual concealer if you have a bad blemish. That's fine with me as it keeps the overall look real, and not like a mask. Also, kudos for offering the different undertones. It made my match a breeze, which is no small feat being pale with both pink and yellow undertones in my skin. It's refreshing to receive a color that isn't super yellow. This is a keeper and something I'm actually excited about for a change.",2
"The 4.2 ounce is 75$ , I got 5 of these for 75$ and got 10 ounces. This is a great size for travel. Product is amazing. I have sensitive skin. I only use it once a week. If you can, grab it now. My skin is so smooth after.",2
"The 8 months of winter with heat running at all times was making my skin super dry! This mask is amazing, makes my skin very smooth and I have noticed a noticeable change. I put the hemp oil over it before bed and wake up with great skin\n Highly recommend",4
"The absolute best! Stays put. Great colour payoff. Lasts all day. If you tend to put glosses or toppers on, or eat oily food, then there will be a bit of fading. But the colour is definitely still there.\n\nNumber 1 was what started my obsession; it's a beautiful red that I think would suit anyone. Number 3 Rose Ink is my most recent purchase, and it is a gorgeous pop of pink; like a barbie print hot pink. Both are bold colours but somehow YSL got the pigmentation just right, so that they are wearable day and night. Numbers 7, 11, 12, & 22 are all in my collection as well. I buy a new colour every time there is a sale.\n\nI love the packaging too; it's so luxe. The applicator is soft and stiff; like a padded paddle. The rigid structure makes it easy for me to line and fill in my lips. It feels like you have nothing on when wearing this product. Very comfortable. I use a scrub on my lips, and then add a balm and let it absorb or dry down, before I use one of these lip stains. I don't find it drying. I usually have to use a makeup remover or micellar water on a cotton pad to take the stains off. Of course, the darker colours are harder to remove. So far, no.3 is the hardest to remove.\n\nThe lip stains tend to have a chemical smell to them that I don't love, but it dissipates and the performance outweighs this so much so that I don't even notice it anymore.\n\nI would highly recommend this YSL lip stain.",2
"The active ingredient is just salicylic acid, but whatever they've done with the delivery of it seems like magic. It doesn't make the acne completely go away, but it relieves even cystic acne so that it's manageable. I just hope they find a way to make this product more affordable!",2
"the beauty points are expired, I got this because I had a sample of the lipstick I got with points and I loved it! It lasted me a while so I got this sample pack to get that and a few extra goodies but there's significantly less in this lipstick sample vs. my last one. other samples seem good but I am a bit disappointed.",1
THE BEST BALM. Been using it since I was 16.   Its super shiny but not sticky and you can wear to bed too especially if you have chapped lips. Its doesnt tingle or sting and doesnt make you chemically addicted to it.  But its also amazing on its own or over other color as a high shine gloss.   every single time I wear it i get asked what i am wearing and who its by and its this.   I but them like 5 at a time scared clinique might discontinue it.,1
"The best caffeine eye cream I've tried. Most dry my eye area out too much. This one did not and I noticed some immediate changes which was nice. I'm 48 so there are no miracles here lol but it did improve my puffy, darker and sallow sockets.",2
The best cheap primer ever! I have tried Dior and other high end primers which I loved but one day on a whim I decided to try this product. I am loving it. It gives ample product with each swipe and is not clumpy at all-stays smooth so you can double apply! It’s a new staple.,0
"The BEST eye creme I have found yet! I have tried La Mer, Paula's Choice, Bobbi Brown, Chanel, Cereve etc. etc. etc. and this is hands down the silkiest, most enriching one yet! Best of all, it scores a rating of 1 on EWG's toxicity scale! The ingredients are fabulous and have helped fade stubborn dark spots around my eyes without irritating when I go to sleep with it on. A must have for me!",0
The best full coverage powder foundation I've found. This powder foundation covers like a liquid foundation would and it is buildable. I've referred all of my friends to it and we all will not buy any other powder foundation again. This is the best!,4
THE BEST IT HOLDA A CURL. NO SMUDGING. NO FLAKING.  IT GIVES GREAT VOLUME. IT LENGTHENS. IT IS DARK BETTER THAN BTS. THEY HIT THIS OUT OF YHE BALL PARK. I LOVE YIU DON'T HAVE WIGGLE THE WAND JUST OUTWARD AND STRAIGHT UP THE LASHES. IT ALSO SEPARATES THE LASHES. NO CLUMPS,3
"The best mascara I have ever tried. I purchased it after having my lash extensions removed and it made my lashes look full and voluminous right away. It never flakes or runs, it stays put all day. best part is I can apply as many coats as needed without it getting clumpy. highly recommend.",4
"The best peel off mask yet!! Does not pull on skin, leaves pores tight ..skin is so soft after!!! I wear it for as long as I can..and a little goes a long way.. probably about 10+ masks, at least.. Glam Glow is THE TEA..and the COOKIES! Great for dry skin... love this mask.. I feel like the tin women.",2
the best pencil eyeliner I had so far.  it stays on and doesn't smudge much throughout long hours wear.  it's hard to find thin pencil liner like this one.  I gave it a 4 because it breaks easily if you turn it too much.  make sure only turn it bits by bits just enough to draw a thin line.  if not it'll break and will be a waste.  A bit on the pricy side because there isn't much in one.  I do love the thinnest of it and it doesnt smudge under my lower eyelids.,2
The best primer I've ever tried. Others always clog my pores. I love it under the Flex Foundation Stick. They are a perfect combination. My tip is to apply with wet hands or mist face first for even coverage and a great moisturizing effect.,2
the best skin care ever.  since I started using this line I no longer wear foundation and my skin looks great.  I work at a Sephora inside JCPenny and love when people ask me what foundation I'm wearing lol.  I point them to this kit!,2
"The best so far! Have tried many shadow primers, they all crease badly. This one is pretty good. I am 51 with minimal wrinkles, but usually have issues in my inner eyelid area. This seems to stay put without creasing, I do set it though otherwise it is hard to blend the outer v.",3
"The bottle is absolutely adorable. The color went on smooth with the brush. I had to apply 2 coats for full coverage. The color was shiny, which lasted 1-2 days. As far as longevity...I was highly disappointed. The nail polish lasted roughly 2-3 days before it began to peel. If I'm going to pay such a high price for nail polish, I'd hope it would last at least a week. Aside from the cute bottle, I was disappointed with the price and product. I wont be purchasing this nail polish again in the future.",3
"The brown is the worst eyeliner I've tried in a long while - patchy and dried out, completely useless. The burgundy is barely a different a different color from the black. The gel ends are terrible: not only is there barely any product, it crumbles all over the place. \n\nSave yourself the hassle and just buy their regular liquid eyeliner, this set isn't worth it.",4
"The brush tip for this eyeliner is thin, so great to build on your eyeliner, but the hairs do come apart. I thought this was something I was doing wrong, but I've gone to several Sephora locations and all the brushes were the exact same way. It also fades a bit by the end of the day.",0
"The C is Real and I am here for it! It usually takes a lot for me to get excited over an eye cream, because of my never say goodbye, stubborn dark eye circles...After only a day or so, I can really see some effective result from the vitamins, with C being applied in 5 forms at once! I am so excited to see what happens from here, because I have waited a proverbial lifetime to find the happy place for my major facial issue. C Tango is one of those lucky finds, like a rare jewel.",2
"the clear formula just falls apart as soon as you try to use it. the formula is way too delicate to have it available in a stick form. as soon as you try to apply it to your lips, it starts to crush down on the body of the lipstick shape, breaking off and crumbling at the base where it connects to the plastic part at the bottom. this is way too expensive for them to not be using a stable enough formula with enough density to withstand the pressure of application to lips. this was not stored in a warm location, and this would make sense if that were the case. The other formulations are okay though. The clear was way too unstable in my opinion. I feel like I wasted my money",4
"The color and warm tone is beautiful but much too bright for me at my age and my rather thin lips.  Also, no staying power.  The search continues for a warm red/coral that is soft yet doesn't need re-applying every 10 minutes.",3
"The color I picked is a little but too deep but I can still work with it, the product itself is great. The only thing I don't like is its applicator tip which doesn't allow you to control how much gets out of the bottle. There should be a little brush instead of the measly opening. Anyway, good pigment.",0
"the color is a little a shy on my, but I tried the candlelight shade and that was too dark, so I think they need some additional color options. this creases on my oily lids, but it still provides decent coverage. haven't tried it under concealer just yet",4
The color is a little more red than expected in my opinion but it is a very pleasing color. The flat rounded brush tip made application neat and easy (three strokes) and two coats. I liked that the second coat didn't darken the color any more. So it retained the brightness. Interested to know what the Cannabis infusion will actually do!,2
The color is great and when the product first goes on it's also great. As the day goes on this product is very drying to my skin and my face is breaking out. Super sad because I loved Urban Decay nearly naked.  I'm sure it's great for others.,3
"The color is the same as the TINTED VEIL, which is perfect for me, being a Brown girl. The undertone of the powder is golden and the same on my skin as Laura Mercier Glow Powder in Translucent. This edition of the veil is a very close match to my complexion. If this helps anyone, my powder shades are: \nFenty Pro Filt'r Powder In Honey, Givenchy in Organza Caramel, ABH Powder in Deep Peach, Becca HydraMist - Golden Bronze. Although it will make a nice setting powder for anyone in the Fit Me powder range of 25 (I'm #30) or deeper. \nSo glad Bare Minerals finally came out with an Mineral Veil edition for Brown skin!!",2
"The color is very true to what it shows online, but it creases easily and I found that I have to reapply several times throughout the day. It has become my backup lip color to keep in my purse for days when I'm not wearing much else on my face but just want a little color on my lips so I don't look like the walking dead. haha!",4
"The color looked great in the photo and I was looking for something that would replace my favorite shade of lipstick that the Body Shop had discontinued. When I received it, I tried it on, and it immediately bled into the fine lines around my lips and stained everything it touched. Had to use tons of makeup remover and elbow grease to scrub this stuff off!",2
"The color match was great and really brightened my under eye area. However, when I left the store and looked in my car mirror, I was horrified. It looked cakey and accentuated all my fine lines. I gave it another go the next day at home. It was difficult to blend, I even warmed it up with my fingers. Did not work for me and I will be returning it.",2
The color of the lipstick on the box and on the label did not match the actual color of the lipstick and does not go well with my skin tone. It's more of a brown color. I do like the lib balm which is why I gave this 3 stars instead of 1. The texture of the lip balm feels nice and is moisturizing.,1
The color of this concealer is perfect but it is thicker than I thought it would be. Am so  used to Touche Eclat which has much thinner consistency. I think I have the hang of it - much less product is needed. Only issue is that up close I do see traces of it in my pores and on my skins. It is not a blendable as it claims.,2
"The colors and formula are amazing. However, I had to return it because as soon as I opened the cap to Flesh 3, the entire lipstick popped out onto the ground.  I would suggest it to try out the colors but know that the tubes are finicky.",1
"The colors and pigment are really nice, even the bold colors still have a smoothness to them.  Ths packaging has a weird smell though, that wet cardboard that re-dried.  If you can get passed that though, this palette is definitely a good look.  (sorry for the crappy cam quality.  it doesnt do the colors justice!)",1
"The colors and pigmentation in this palette are amazing. This is the first large Huda Beauty palette I have purchased and I'm not sad about it. All of the shades have performed incredibly.  I love the looks I have been able to create. I'm not really sure why all the bad reviews regarding the dry or flaky glitter texture.  The palette clearly states that there is a glitter powder shade. Use of your finger, glitter glue or spray your brush with setting spray and it works gorgeously.",2
"The colors and pigments are incredible. For the first time ever, I dont have to worry about the staying power of my blush over the course of a day. It STAYS. The Houseglass blushes and bronzers are so beautiful and I love that in this palette I dont have to choose between them. Usually I swirl the brush around all four and dab them on my cheeks, then blend all around my face for an overall glow. Just so happy.",0
"The colors are gorgeous.... but patchy.  I had to work way too much to blend them, especially the two purple shades,  and the blue glitter one does not work on its own. I had to pat in four layers of the blue on each eye to see any color.  When I layered the gold on top of the almost nonexistent blue, I made this gorgeous frosty shade. The only pro was that once I finished,  they lasted 12 hours intact.  However, I did get major eye irritation the second time I used them.  Overall, I probably would never purchase a full sized palette from this brand just because of the problems with this mini. For me, it did not live up to the hype.",4
The colors are just beautiful. It has all the colors I ware every day and for special occasions! To me this is the BEST palet of eyeshadow I’ve ever seen!  The quality is great and the eyeshadow last all day,1
"The colors are not like they are online. Way too brown toned in my opinion and the nude has no pink to it, it just washes me out. I'd actually call all three colors ugly. The tiny packaging would be ok if I liked the colors because they are easy to carry around in a small purse.",1
"The colors are pretty, but there's nothing even remotely nude about them. They look nothing like the photo. They are warm copper, which makes me look like I am ill and haven't slept in a month. That said, if extremely warm colors suit your complexion, they blend well and are highly pigmented. The quality is there, the color is just not for me. I get creasing after 3 hours when worn over UD Primer Potion, but I have deeply hooded eyes, so it happens.",3
"The colors are very pretty but the formula is average. You definitely need primer or it will fade quickly and crease, even with primer it does fade and crease but not as quickly. I find it lasts best if you apply it over a powder shadow. I don't regret buying it because it really is beautiful and unique. The glitter and sparkle are gorgeous.",3
"The colors in this pallette are beautiful. Neutrals with an edge, all colors go well with each other. The pigment is plenty for me, I don't need it to be a sharpie for my eyes. Smooth, with shimmers and mattes. Love it.",4
"The colors themselves look beautiful, they blend easily, but... they disappear in 5 hours. I always apply eyeshadows on primer, either Too Faced or Urban Decay one, and all other products stay on for a whole day, even when it's hot and humid. For this price, I expected higher quality. Attaching before/after picture, so you can see.",2
"The colors were gorgeous, they just didn't work for me. I am allergic to most liquid shadows, and I did have a reaction to these. They are super pigmented and very metallic. They did crease on my eyelids & also crumbled off after a few hours.",2
"The color was more rose than terracotta on me. The glitter was not chunky or gritty, but it did move. I had glitter shifting a bit. The smell is what I did not enjoy. I have the mini matte set and love them, but this one was just meh. This little guy is going back to the store. I am a bit disappointed in it.",2
The colour is great but the formula is very heavy and drags on the lips. It's not because the formula is dry because I use the retro-matte lipsticks of MAC and love them. It feels like play dough and smells like one within a year.,1
"The colour is perfect. I was really pleased with the capacity. Longevity is better than most but not as good as Mac's Dazzleglass - which I now judge all gloss against. It lasts about 2-3 hours max without eating. \nMedium thickness - not too thin, not super sticky. could.be a bit thicker.",3
the combination of this particular brush and the formula makes it virtually impossible to apply without making a clumpy mess.   will not purchase again.  formula seems fine when I use another mascara wand to fix the disaster,2
"The concealer is rather heavy/thick, but this is a great corrector palette- and for a great price. I needed a new one, and it was Pantone, so I was compelled. I'd purchase again, though I only use about a third of the colors.",2
"The contour powder and blush are very nice. However, the quality of the eyeshadows were subpar... Especially the metallic shades citrine and topaz, very hard to pick up with a brush and even with finger application they were very crumby and uneven. Disappointed.",0
The cream itself is a nice texture and dries well/not greasy. I don't like the smell - sort of toasted coconut and sweet - but that's personal preference. My biggest issue is that the smell is so strong and lingers for ages. I had to wash my hands after a half hour to get rid of most of the smell. I petted my cat a bit after applying and a full 24 hours later his head still smells like the cream.,4
"The cute packaging and price point peeked my interest.  Most of the reviews are positive, so I thought it was a good choice to purchase this.  However, it does absolutely nothing for me.  The little metal ball, fell off the top.  I cannot properly apply this.  When, I was able to use this, it didn’t last past 10 minutes.  Not worth it.  The cute packaging doesn’t make up 4 it",3
"The deciding factor to purchase was the full size Tarte. I have a reward size balm in nude and think it's one of the best balms available and even wear it to bed. FYI It is very minty and sheer. UD Balktalk is a muted rose and lasts a few hours before reapplying. I will note it was sweating since other reviewers complained about spoilage and damages in this bag. I have owned quite a few UD lipsticks and have not seen any sweating until now. I like the Bite Chai, it's a darker nude and lasts really well but I have this size so wish they used a different color. The LM is a beautiful red, goes on silky and stays about 2 hours. The Anastasia is so dry and grayish it looks Goth. It looks great under the LM and makes LM last a bit longer. This kit is great. I might buy the JCP exclusive kit on the sale to get Tarte nude balm but why the higher price and lass product? Also,  please stop using Play! reruns in these. Thx.",3
The deep red/brown colors drew me to this palette. It did not disappoint once I tried it out. I have a deep brown skin complexion and each color shows up lovely and complementing. Love love this palette and happy with my purchase.,2
The description for this product is absolutely spot on. I've been looking to try powder puffs for a while and I impulsively bought this while waking down the Sephora aisle. I wouldn't change anything about this puff.,0
"The eye lash curler is nice and the tweezers are just okay. They are not made of the same metal as the regular tweezermans. These feel cheap and made of tin? I'm not impressed but they work okay, I'm just not into the feel of the handle.",1
"The eyeliners included in this kit are black. The eyeshadow from Urban Decay goes on more of a gold color on me. It is awesome and full sized too. This is a very, very good value for the money, as are all these sets. I definitely recommend this and I may buy another one. The only one I have found in this kit that I do not care for is the Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil in Whatever Black. It's a little dry. Highly recommend, especially trying these items before you buy.",3
"The eyeshadows are OK in the palette，but the overall colors are too light，even with the dark purple is helpless to create a whole look. If you would like to purchase peach collection, I would rather recommend the original palette. That one is way better. Plus, this product has a strong scent, be careful if you don't prefer fragrance in eyeshadows.",4
"The FIRST day I wore this after a long weekend, I had so many compliments on my makeup. One coworker asked if I had been in the sun and I told her about this awesome product. I love how I can get away without wearing foundation so it cuts down my morning routine. I love it so much!",4
The first thought I had as I smelled this for the first time was my Mom.  It brought me back to being a child and a perfume she wore called White Shoulders.  Love the scent!  Love the memory even better.,3
"The first time I tried this balm it made a huge mess and a lot was wasted because it was too soft. I thought maybe it was because it was in my jacket pocket (although the day was quite cold and snowy). Unfortunately, no matter where it's been stored, the result is the same; a big mess. The balm is just way too soft to be in a stick, and a lot of product gets wasted. The balm itself is moisturizing, but doesn't stay on for very long.",2
"The first time I used it I had been wearing my makeup for a few hours and decided to apply, I do feel it helped spruce up my makeup's appearance. When I used it before makeup I was excited to see if it blurred my pores like some primers and I saw little to no difference which was a bit disappointing.",4
"the first time I used this i applied it too thickly. it  burned my skin in little patches. I learned from my mistake, and now I love it! definitely apply in thin even layer (I find using a brush works best). I stress about milia and age spots, and this mask has been taking them away slowly!",2
"The first time used sample and  I loved it. It made my face felt like a hydration firm out there . I bought one full size after.  It's nice but can't remove makeup throughly,bit weak and kinda drying my skin(dobt know if it is because my routine chabged). There could be better options.",4
The formula is nice and effective but the gel is peeling making my make-up worn off almost instantly...The packaging looks good but the two part is a gimmick in my opinion...Half of the time the concentrate serum (the green one) don't even appear in the gel pump and sometime theres alot of it...Its not really consistent...I returned it for those reason...And i think for for the price point there is better options out there.,0
"The foundation brush works fine but concealer one is disappointing. It kind of worked fine for the first use but by the next use it couldn't blend well, could hardly blend anything. I had to use the foundation brush to blend it all in. I probably won't buy it again.",1
"The fragrance in this sleeping mask is so calming and light. I love it! I have seen huge difference ever since I started using this mask daily. My skin is much smoother and plump. I see that is limited edition, please dont discontinue this lavender mask!!",3
"The full size baby facial alone costs $80, so for $8 more you get sample sizes of some of the best DE products. The purple product (forgot the name) and the marula oil are both especially great for moisturizing in the dry winter months a.k.a. now.",4
the glitter itself is beautiful but the container is awful and i have no idea how to efficiently get the product out and use it without a ton of waste and the glitter is not full size as others have mentioned so over all not happy with these and will return,0
"The gloss itself is amazing. Love the feel, texture, all flattering shades that last a long time. If I could only commit to one gloss, this would be it. BUT... a major but it the packaging. After a few uses I find myself having to constantly wipe the outside of the tube, no matter what I did it just made a mess and kept leaking out. Literally after sitting upright at my desk I would find it leaking out of the tube. Couldn't even carry in my purse anymore. This happened with three separate tubes! Not only did it make it a hassle to deal with, but it also wasted a ton of good product. Gloss is A+, but I can't buy it again until they redesign the tube.",4
"The good: once this product is on properly the eyebrows look great. The bad: the first 'swipe' is always very thick and clumpy and I need another brush to disperse the product. Not sure how to solve this problem, so probably wouldn't order again.",3
"the highlighter colour is beautiful, yet too dark for my light skin. I use it as an eyeshadow for daily wear and I love it. a pop of sparkle to the eyelids. lip gloss is very nice but similar to many other glosses out there. still love the set!",1
"The highlights were great. I wish they made it all highlight and didn't include the contour because some highlight actually got on the cream contour and made it so messy-- the packaging is also not the best, it gets dirty really fast.",0
"The ingredients in this are crap, and the formula is way too slick for anything to adhere, especially in the summer time. This felt like it broke up my complexion makeup. The one saving grace is that it feels so silky smooth upon application.",0
Their foundation is a 2 in 1 because you get the skin care benefits that no other foundation has.. everyone has their own opinion on this but the foundation is just breath taking.. it sets on its own so no need for powder which I don't like to do.. and it still has the glow of Radiance with soft powder finish on the skin.. it's skin like.. a true medium coverage.. nothing more. .. but I love it because it shows my skin and I love how it sits on my skin... the only foundation I wear.. when I am not wearing this.. I wear my others ones that I do not care for but trying to finish because they are not cheap either but I usually am bare face with sunscreen any way.. I have all their products and recommend all because it lives up to the claims.. \nI bought the Buff 23A and it was too dark for me so I have shade Sand that one matches and if I find it too light.. I use the Drunk and Elephant Anti pollution bronze with the foundation.. just a drop.. and it's gorgeous I tell you.. GORGEOUS!! \nPLEASE TRY IT AND GIVE IT A CHANCE because you will not be disappointed!! \noh and one more thing.. I live in Las Vegas and it is hot out here so I tested it and it did not budge once. . it was even more beautiful..!,1
Their glitter palette is for Pro's which I am not.  They work best with mixing mediums and that is something I dont have time for daily.  Hands down Viseart makes the best mattes but Im not a fan of any of their glitter.,4
"The is a dewy skin product. Definitely NOT a concealer, there is no coverage, a slight brightening effect, definitely glowy for the high points of the cheeks. I just don’t think it should be advertised as a concealer, it is more of a highlighter, think of ambient light powders in a twist up liquid form. The is perfect to put over foundation (doesn’t lift it), the applicator is not my fave, but I can twist up enough product to swipe a brush a crossed it to apply. I am sure I could pluck off the applicator if I tried. I received this complimentary from influenster",1
"The jury  is still out on this one but I do like the convenience of this device as it’s very easy to include into my beauty regime and I really like the fix-it serum that you use with it \n, but I’m not sure if it really erases lines yet.  I haven’t been using it for more than a week because I just got it, but I do like it and I love the idea of it and hopefully it will make a difference eventually.",3
The Kat Von D power was superb in the previous iteration. The case is heavy and doesn't always open properly.  The power easily cracks and gets all over everything.  Whoever designed the new case did not have a traveler in mind.  It's heavy.,3
The Laneige lip sleeping mask has been one of my FAVORITES from the first time I purchased it. It is my go-to product I use CONSTANTLY because it works. I had really dry lips working in a dry environment so I can't live without this product. I got this set to try the different scents and honestly hope they make these flavors permanent!!,0
"The lash enhancer works quickly if you are consistent. It is awesome to get a full size for $10 less in this box and I would buy this again. Between 10/27/2019 and 11/8/2019 there has been significant growth and fullness to my lashes. This is more cost effective and easily available than another brand I was using that cost twice as much. \nThe lash primer works pretty well, it gets a little clumpy but I use it at night mostly to try to train some of my eyelashes that are bent funny from the way I sleep. I have not tried the makeup eraser, it is so tiny I lost it in my makeup drawer right away. But the kit worth it for the lash enhancer alone!",1
The lip glosses are nice itself. I liked at least 2 colors from this set. The problem is I got this set already USED and its disgusting. Will be returning...I definitely don't pay 25$ for  used product.,3
"The lip mask and the night treatment are AMAZING. They leave my lips so soft and smooth. I get really chapped lips, so I have quite enjoyed those two products. \n\nThe daytime balm, however, is a total miss. When you try to apply it from the tube, even if you only roll the product up the tiniest fraction, it just disintegrates as soon as you apply any pressure. Mine completely crumpled into a sticky mess. It’s lovely if you dip into the tube after it collapses and  apply it with a brush or your fingers, but at that point, you may as well save yourself the mess and just buy one of the other very effective products, instead.\n\nI will definitely be repurchasing the lip mask and night treatment when I run out, but it’s a hard pass on the daytime balm.",2
"The lippie is wonderful and the sole reason this set gets three rather than two stars. The moisturizer is not terrible, but nothing special. The mascara is, without question, the WORST mascara I have ever used. It's so thick and dry that it's almost impossible to get it to transfer to your lashes. And, it's a funky brown color, too. The wipes I haven't used. But again, the lippie is fantastic!",3
The lotion has a good texture and feels good and cooling but the applicator has very sharp edges and constantly scratches my eyes. The ball part of the applicator feels nice but if I don't hold the applicator perfectly straight it scratches and pinches my skin.,3
"The luttle chapstick broke upon first use. The mask and the night balm are great, but the little daytime chapstick immediately broke. Very disappointed. I had to just mush the broken part back on to the chapstick.",0
"The main problem I've had with this sunscreen is that it is just too yellow toned. I imagine that it would would for light medium skin tones, but if you're ghostly pale, this just looks like poorly blended foundation. I've also found that it doesn't really sink into the skin all that well, and it seems to separate toward the end of the day. I do however, like that the spf is higher than most sunscreens; it just isn't cosmetically elegant.",1
The marker type end bled a little on top of shadow.  The pencil end worked well but I’ll continue to work with it because I really like the convenience of having the two different types in one. The color is a nice deep black.,3
The mascara was the real reason I bought this kit. The brows and lip balm were a bonus. The Mascara is super good (I had a mini from another kit and love it.) Tiny lip balms tend to break. I have yet to use the brow product because I have two currently in use.,1
The mask was drenched in product and there was a good amount left in the package too. It’s a watery type serum that smells like pineapple candy which I found to be a bit strong at first. The overall fit was good but the eye area needed adjustments. It adhered well to my face and stayed in place well over the recommended 15 minutes since it was still wet. I waited until it was almost all dried up to remove it. My skin was soft and a bit more hydrated. Overall my face looked smooth and a tad more radiant but it did not shrink my pores all that much. I don’t have very large pores to begin with but sometimes they are more visible and that’s when I decided to use this mask. It helped but not as much as I thought it would. Still not a bad mask.,1
"The mattes are very buildable and easy to work with; it would be hard to overdo it with these. The glitters are very pretty, and the shimmers are nice quality, too. I was sent this palette for consideration by Influenster, but I don't think I would have purchased it with my own money. It's not overly unique and the formula isn't the best, but it is a nice palette and good for beginners, so it gets an average three stars.",1
The mist felt refreshing and hydrating on my face. The smell was a little strong for my taste and I had to keep my eyes closed  for a couple more seconds after spraying to keep my eyes from watering. It absorbed and dried within seconds and left a youthful glow. My skin did feel calm and nourished after each use. The mist was lightweight and not heavy or sticky on my skin.,0
"The moisturizer is just crazy. When I first started using it I didn't think it was going to be any good because it's this weirdly thin concoction, but it soaks in and my skin has been great! No related breakouts, and no flaky patches. I'm on my second jar. Holding off on the serum until winter when my skin needs the extra help.\nI wasn't expecting much from the eye patches after reading some of the reviews so they were a pleasant surprise. Cooling and definitely took away some under eye puffiness.",3
"The moisturizing properties are good, but it's one of the worst things I've ever smelled and I work in a funeral home, so that's saying a lot. If someone drank a toasted coconut smoothie and vomited it up 2 hours later, I imagine it would smell much like this cream. Fortunately the overwhelming stench fades rather quickly and leaves a lighter but still odd lingering scent after an hour or so. I would not pay for this as there are much better options available, but I will try to use the sample because I hate waste (and I do have very dry skin!)",2
The most amazing kid I have ever used in my life I have literally thrown out every contour kit that I have ever purchased I have mac contour I have Too faced I have from luxury to drugstore and I have gotten rid of all of them well this palette is on sale grab one or two like I did \nAll 6 pans  of product from cream to powder you will use every single product does what it needs to do and beyond I don't know why nobody is talking about the fact that  creams and powders last for 12 hours straight I put it on at 10 a.m. and it was just as strong on my face at 10 p.m. until I use the makeup wipe to take it off,3
"The MOST BEAUTIFUL burgundy shade I have ever used. I have extremely dry lips and between that and the dry Canadian winters, I almost never opt for liquid lipsticks. This formula is the exception. It lasts for hours but literally feels like nothing on the lips (you have to try it on t believe it). The shade selection is dreamy and when it fades off, it leaves behind the most gorgeous stain. This never dries my lips out, and I can wear it on top of a light lip balm and still get the same wear time and effect. I HIGHLY recommend this particular shade, it's my FAVORITE for the winter time. I am already eyeing a few more shades to pick up during the Rouge sale",0
The nocturnal Nirvana palette is one of the best palettes for Jewel tone colours. It has a mixture of Pat McGrath blitz shades and VR shade. I find that Pat McGrath eyeshadow quality is long-lasting and Superior to any other eyeshadow palettes I've ever used. Her shadows are very unique as well.,2
"the only feedback on this entire line, is this blur stick is small and lasts about a week or two if you use it daily! way too small. also product breaks off easily due to shape. if it was same size & shape as all over face colour tubes it would be SO much better!",3
"The only good thing about this is the packaging.  This mascara is so disappointing.  No volume or length payoff, that I can tell.  Color is black but with the formula so dry or thin - I actually think my lashes look punier with this on than naked.",2
"The only Melt palette I ended up loving. greens are my favorite.  the shimmer shades are intense, the lasting power is great. exactly the kind of colors I needed. The mattes blend well and last. I took a nap with this makeup on and my eyes still looked great when I woke up. the shades are very soft though, my first palette arrived broken so I had to exchange it in store. be careful not to dig in too much with your brush since they are so soft.",0
"the only negative thing I can say about this product is that every day I worry I might run out. I'm 47, I have fabulous skin, but only because I grew up when they're was an ozone layer (sorry youngins) and I have always taken good care of my skin. I thought I had hit a plateau until I found this product, but after just a few weeks I noticed more even skin tone. I use this AM and PM as part of a multi layer routine, made up of mostly The Ordinary products. I'm hooked, I would say run away and save yourself but only because I want it all for myself.",3
"The only positive I can say about this is that it made my pores look smaller. But, the color was way off and I've tried two colors. The fair is ghost white and the light is way too dark and orangey. It dried out my skin, and absolutely does not cover minor imperfections. Very disappointing.",1
"The only reason this product gets 2 stars is due to its packaging.  it's very easy to apply and it looks like it would keep the product from oxidizing, and it does truly blur the imperfections of the skin, but that's it.  After applying, it pills quickly and completely off my face, forcing me to clean off my skin with a washcloth to start my skincare routine over (luckily I hadn't applied it to my undereye area yet so I didn't have to redo that tedious chore).  So, I'm glad I got this as a sample rather than forking out some $$ then have to return it.  Nice concept,  poor execution, Milk.",3
The only reason this won't get 5 stars is because it's so pricey. I use this every morning after hyaluronic Acid and have had no issues with sensitivity. It's not greasy and packed with everything you want in a wrinkle fighter.,1
The only reason this won't get 5 stars is because it's so pricey. I use this every night after hyaluronic Acid and before my eye cream and have had no issues with sensitivity. It's not greasy and packed with everything you want in a wrinkle fighter.,1
the only thing I don't like is the scent but it doesn't linger so that doesnt bother me. it makes me glow and makes every foundation I own look absolutely fantastic. I cant speak to wear time increase but that's not really why I use primer.,1
"The original formula I felt was far superior as it moisturized and had longevity. Even after using liquid lipsticks, the old formula felt soothing and repaired my lips. This has a less moisturizing effect, my lips do not seem to recover as well after using liquid lipstick, and tastes awful. The old formula was 1 of only a few items I would go in a Sephora store to get (online order everything else). I already use the Agave mask at night so this balm for day use is now a pass for me. Really sad when a company has an incredible product and then messes it up with reformulating or discontinuing it. I see this balm eventually being discontinued due to the negative feedback of the new formula.",3
The original formula was amazing. It transformed my skin and made it super soft and evened out the texture. It helped my skin look amazing when travelling and even in polluted cities. The new formula does not make my skin soft and this benefit is no longer listed on the bottle. Not as silky nor as easily absorbed.,4
"The packaging for this (and all of the brands products) is so cool!  They come in a plastic bag filled with gold sequins.  This shade is very pretty, but I have to be careful with it since it can look white on my eyelids, which is supposed to make you look older.  It lasts a nice amount of time.  What fun!  And so pretty!",3
"the packaging is flimsy, the bb in itself is good. saw some negative reviews that left me skeptical but I tried. must say the quality is good. it fluffs up on damping unlike other blenders which bulks up. the dye didn't run off. I received a pink one. and the smell of the cleaner is very mild",4
"The palette shades are a very wearable, everyday type of palette. I think this was what it was intended for since the item is marketed to be finger friendly. When applying the product with my finger, I get a more subtle color payoff, but the term ""blur"" is more apparent. When applied with brushes, the color payoff is more pigmented. Overall I think this palette is very nice for work because it can be applied easily with fingers, or be brought up in intensity with brushes for a night out. Removing a star for some inconsistency in the amount of ""bounce"" within colors. The darkest shade had the most bounce, while the first 4 shades felt like a firm velvety powder. I had to swirl a brush around the first 4 colors before the ""bounce"" was apparent; yet they still were not as bouncy as the last shade. \n\nI\xa0received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1
"The papers themselves are fantastic and keep me from getting shiny, which has helped my acne immensely. The cartridge is cute, but it's really hard to tear away a sheet without ripping it almost entirely in half.",4
"The particles in this mask are very angular and irregularly shaped, meaning that if I follow the directions and massage it on my face during application, some particles internally create micro-tears in my skin. not good. the smell doesn't really bother me, but this didn't do anything for my skin the one time I used it, and it's going in the trash as I don't want to damage my skin with physical abrasion.",3
"The Peach lol balm smells absolutely amazing! Super creamy and easy to apply. I don't prefer lip balms in this format, but picked this up on a whim. The lip balm itself is pretty moisturizing, but seems to fade pretty fast so I find myself having to reapply frequently.",1
The perfect foundation for me. I'm combo skin type leaning more towards the dry side. This foundation made me look hydrated and natural and the shade was perfect. I use this and set with Laura Mercier setting powder and Urban Decay's all nighter setting spray and I looked flawless all night. I absolutely love this product!,0
"The photo doesn’t properly represent these colours. While they aren’t bad colours, they are much brighter than shown. Almost neon. I had to return as they weren’t wearable on my fair skin for every day. I also found them a bit drying.",0
"The pigments are nice to begin with, but after couple hours, it creased and disappeared. All of the shades on my lids just kind of turned into a gray, brown ish color. The packaging is cute but I guess 2faced put all the effort into packaging instead of the product. Returned.",1
the plume lashes are probably the most realistically natural looking lashes I've ever used for my monolid eyes. I've been asked over and over if they are Lash extensions and people are always amazed that they are strip lashes. HOWEVER ONE HUGE DRAWBACK is that after each use you will lose and shed many lashes and as other users have complained already they will literally fall apart after the second use. I've tried everything from using less glue to being exceptionally gentle with removal... these lashes are like the equivalent to extremely sheer pantyhose handle with extreme care and caution otherwise they're pretty much useless after one or two uses,3
"The pot I got of this was completely dried out and gummy at the bottom, the container was maybe 1/3 full. It's hard to say how the actual product is because it was spoiled before I could use it. I know that's not fair to write a review if you haven't tried it but hear me out. For a product to look like it did, that's caused by evaporation leaving only the wax and oils behind. This is a new release from boscia supposedly, so it would have to be sitting in a box for at least a year for this to happen, probably longer. I just don't feel like this product is fresh or potent, and if I repurchased it all I would wonder is if it's old and not effective anymore.",1
"The powder itself may be great, but the product design is horrible.  No matter what I do, I can't get the last 1/3 of the powder out of the container.  Does anyone know how to break open the top without making a mess so I can use all of the powder that I bought?",2
"The product blends very easily. Even if you are not very experienced with cream contour, you can make this work for you. I use the Bobbi Brown Full Coverage Face Brush which is made for liquid/cream products and it has been great. I do use my fingers when I apply the highlighter though. Since the shade part it is quite warm, it works for both light contouring",0
"The product delivers the basic expectation: better hair.  I cannot comment on better skin, unfortunately but definitely be sure to pull off as much of your makeup as possible before ending your day.  My main suggestion is to take care when laundering the pillowcase.  For me, cleanliness is a higher desire than maintaining the pristine condition of the pillowcase.  To that end, it did indeed experience some wear when laundered with detergent and medium drying temperatures.  I will try it with gentler soap and drying in future washings and plan to buy at least one more case.",1
"The product is nice but you get such a small amount that its not worth the price tag. Its nice, but its not THAT nice!! I love Lancer but this won’t last as long as my other products. I’m sure I can find another hyaluronic acid product that will be just as effective.",3
"The product is very nice, but there is a lot of plastic packaging and I cannot see a recycling number on it. It's great the the product is ""clean"", but it isn't very ""clean"" to throw the container into the landfill.",2
"The product looked fine on my lashes but nothing special.  In fact it seemed to weigh down my lashes so I had no curl, and that was with only 1 coat.  The biggest problem to me is the wand, more specifically the brush.  Holy moly, it's huge!  I had a hard time applying the mascara without getting it on my eyelid.",2
The quality is questionable to be honest. I wear lashes everyday and I bought my first pair a couple weeks ago. They lastest me over twenty times before breaking. Just bought a bunch more cuz I was so impressed and the lashes are a great style and yet I just took off my lashes after wearing them once and they fell apart. So I'm unsure how I feel about these. Trying out another pair. Hoping it was just one bad set,0
There are 2 sets of colors that look almost the exact same.  On the left side top left and bottom right golds are identical.  Then the two on the bottom (brown shade) on the right side of the pallet and the left.  To pay $129 for a pallet with 18 color and to really only receive 16 not worth it.,0
"There are a lot of ""light"" moisturizers on the market already. What was the need to change the original formula? It is not as thick and moisturizing, has more of that watery feeling protini has, and overall feels like a different category of cream than the original Lala. I've been using the original Lala for over 2 years now. Again, they already have a watery cream with Protini. There was no need to reformulate Lala. The packaging also feels cheaper. It kind of feels like their cheapening the ingredients and packaging to increase profit (which I hope isn't true). Bring back the original",0
"There are several things I love about this product. Firstly, it smells almost a bit minty. It's really refreshing. Secondly, it makes my skin feel clean in a way no other product does. Truly like I've just had a facial. Thirdly, and most amazingly, I feel like this makes my skin glow extra radiantly for like 3 days after I use it. I've been using it once a week but am going to start doing it twice a week. This is a great product for dry, sensitive skin in the winter.",0
"There are tons of Vit.C serums out there, many running at high price points with questionable quality. Some don't seem to absorb, or they are oxidized & are not very potent. I have been on a quest to find a product to brighten my aging skin and have seriously feel like I have bought them all; Drunk Elephant, Peter Thomas Ross, Timeless. I bought this one out of curiosity and was slightly disappointed my first couple uses, as my skin broke out and was a bit irritated. But I stuck it out a couple more days and now I am on my third bottle. \n\nIt is the best Vit.C serum I have used and a definately notice a difference in my skin. My skin isn't as dull as it was, it has brightened and smile lines are less visible. I noticed a difference after the first couple weeks and it is way more affordable than others, which aren't half as good. It is now a permanent part of my skin care routine. I really rely on reviews to guide me in my purchases here and thought I should take the time to write something as it is a really nice product.",4
"There are too many negatives to list, but the only one that actually matters is that it is marketted as an eyeshadow and an inner corner  ""pop of highlight"" but the warnings cleary advise to keep it OUT of your eyes. It is water soluble and an eye is wet. This will absolutely get in your eyes....stay away, and shame on them. Great idea but I guess it's too soon to market an SPF product that isn't eyesafe. \n\nAND if it is somehow eyesafe, the packaging is misleading and contradicting.",4
"there is a reason BECCA products are so popular. this is one of the best sets I've ever bought. the primer is amazing, the highlighter is so gorgeous and luxurious and natural, and that setting powder is the BOMB! this is my go to all day eeeery day.",4
there is more grape seed oil than hemp seed in these products so if anything it should be marketed as grape seed oil. As a huge advocate for cannabis I was extremely excited to try it. I was not impressed by the intense green dye that was used in both products. We get it cannabis is trying to be marketed but i wasn't impressed.\n\nOverall since it is a face oil it did do the job since it is an oil. I did like mixing it with my night cream. But for the price point and the way it was marketed - - i probably would not recommend. Because it just seemed as if the company tried to get on the cannabis craze bandwagon. I received this product for free to review,0
There is no way of getting the stamp on the skin without it bleeding into your natural skin lines. What’s worse is that it is so hard to remove from the skin even with multiple attempts using an oil-based makeup remover and soap. Leaves stains behind on the skin. Definitely would not recommend.,0
"There isn't really anything exciting about this powder, but it does everything a powder should perfectly. It has no flashback in photos, sets makeup to last all day, doesn't reduce the coverage of the products you put it over, and it isn't overly mattifying - it just gives a natural satin finish. I have dry skin and it doesn't dry me out or make my skin look dry. I use the universal version and it works great for my fair skin. One jar of this lasted me almost 2 years and the price is great. I'm trying a new powder out now, but it doesn't seem to compete with this one.",3
There's so much hype around this palette. I grabbed it on sale to see what all the hype was about. I had been debating for a while and snatched it when I could save some money. It didn't work for me. The shades muddied together. I tried several shades and had no luck... This was a return. Very disappointing:(,2
"The reviews about the inability to sharpen this liner are correct. I tried with my Laura Mercier and my Sephora sharpeners. The liner just breaks off in chunks. For what use you get, the pigment is definitely a classic black.",1
"the reviews are all over the place for this product so I was worried about trying it. to my surprise, it is very light. it doesn't leave any kind of tacky or sticky sheen on my skin. it absorbs right into my skin imediately. the packaging is super cute and the smell is lovely as well.",4
"The reviews are pretty accurate.   The body butter feels SO good and smells great, but if the Pumpkin scent is what you're looking for, this is NOT it.  It really does smell like almond and maybe even a hint of sweet vanilla?  I still like it though and it really nice. I will definitely be buying more but just I'm just warning other buyers who might be invested in the pumpkin theme for fall.",1
"The rose shade was too dark and opaque for me. Wish they had a cooler-toned version of the Original Pink. Love that this has broad-spectrum SPF. It felt dry to me, but I’m comparing it to Fresh’s lip treatments so maybe my standards are too high lol",2
"The scent...Imagine a sunny warm beach full of sun bathers drizzled in caramel...lol....Yes! its delightfully wonderful. The feeling, like running your hands over a thick silk sheet, its creamy and luxurious. I use this before bed on my hands, elbows, and knees, I then drift off to sleep.\nTo touch, it's not watery, slick, or greasy.....and the most important thing, it's not sticky.\nI cant see anyone not loving this, unless they are allergic to it.\nIf you are debating, just buy the small one, it goes pretty far.",2
"The scent is very strong, which is often the case with Korean skincare products. It smells like a masculine cologne that lingers a bit. I don’t mind that much, but if you’re sensitive, you might want to reconsider. The foam is nice and fluffy but dries my skin out more than usual. I think this product would work better for oily skin.",1
"The scent of this night cream is delicious. The fresh peach smell is light and refreshing. This cream is pretty heavy so I wouldn't recommend it for oily girls, but would probably be perfect for those who tend to be more on the dry side. I don't really consider my skin to be very sensitive, but this really irritated my face after a few hours. I do not recommend this for sensitive skin. Had I not had any irritation, I would use this again. But I won't be putting this one in my skin care regimen for now. \n\n***This product was received complimentary from Influenster for review***",2
These are absolutely awesome! Love the concept! So easy to incorporate into your day! Gelatin IS CLEARLY WRITTEN on the back of the second picture. You can clearly read all the ingredients. You just have to look closer!! I have Migraines w/aura and I'm very very picky about vitamins and supplements that I take because some of them can exacerbate a Migraine etc.,3
"These are amazing. I bought the small packs a few times, but have bought the large pack twice now. I have very oily skin, so dead skin cells dont slough off as they should, and my skin will look dull and textured because of it. The Extra Strength peels are something I will not be without. They have minimized my pores, reduced the number of breakouts that I get, and my skin looks bright, healthy, and flawless. I recommend them to everyone, but be mindful of getting the appropriate strength for your skin type. Someone who is dry or dry-combo should gravitate more towards the gentle/normal formula, and start out with only a few times per week to avoid over exfoliation and irritation. You can increase use once skin has become acclimated to the product. I use them at night only, and one must use an SPF during the day as AHAs cause increased sensitivity to the sun.",4
These are by far the best made lashes by Huda. The band is thinner and more flexible compared  to others (samantha #7- a casual lash favourite). These are great with or without eyeliner for a extra or soft glam look. Love love these. I used to get my lashes done for any big event. This lash replaces that need (with the exception of water of course)!,1
These are go-to eye mask! The grape and cucumber are my two faves. They are $5 each and work AMAZINGLY. I wear mine for 20 minutes after a hard day. They're super hydrating and feel great on my eyes. A trick I do to make them even more satisfying.. stick them in the fridge or freezer for 3 minutes. BEST way to get the cooling affect especially when using the cucumber version.,0
These are highlighters. Not blush and highlighter. They are super sparkly with a lot of glitter pieces. I did decide not to purchase the full size gold duo after using this because these are a bit sheer. More glitter than color but they are very pretty and are noticable over blush. The pink rounds out blush nicely but not so much alone.,3
"These are more a toner than a full on peel. The ingredients do help brighten complexion, but the results aren't going to be seen immediatley. They are little textured rounds with serum/toner in them. There is no worries about it stinging or anything. They really just help even out skin tone and lessen redness. It's not a peel, but a evening out of the skin. That said, they do a pretty good job helping with the decreasing of redness. These are fine for sensitive skin. It is a lot of money for something you can do with just a cotton ball and some good toner.",1
these are NUDE colors. the only color that doesnt match my cool tone pale skin is Peachy but the rest look great! I use lip liners to blend these shades. I think they are the perfect liquid lips for mixing with other nudes in the center of the lip. If you dont like Nude lipsticks you won't like these. the gloss gives a beautiful shine without grit and the metallic is a good formula! i would say this really only compliments light/fair complexions.\n\n- I received this lip set in a voxbox from Influenster - all opinions are my own.,1
"These are ok. I took them for about a year and they really didn't too much for my hair. My nails great! But I don't need help w my nails. I'm sure they work for some, but not me. Taste great! I love HUM as a company and love many other of their products.",3
These are pricey which makes me a little frustrated now that I feel like I can't live without them.  The individually sealed pads are convenient for travel.  This product has cleared up any chance that I ever have a breakout!,2
"These are really awesome! They glide on easily and leave a perfect hint of color. The eye veil is cute but I don't get it, how do you put it on? That seems like a waste of time and money but the lip balms were so awesome I  don't really care.",2
"These are really, really bad.  I ordered a couple, love the idea with sparkles in the liner.  Two of the liners were all broken & fell apart immediately.  The colors were really not all that great either. HUGE disappointment! Save your $$-",3
"These are so dewy, your cheeks will glow all day. But you need to stipple them over foundation or it will move your base. If you have a really heavy base then this might mess with it a bit. I can't wait to try other colours",1
"These are the best facial wipe around, I've tried a lot but these make my skin feel the best. So refreshing and makes face look very healthy and clean, and the primer is nice too! This is such a good deal too because you get a decent size pore primer mini for free with it and usually that costs 100 points in the rewards or is worth $6 roughly. I can't say enough good things about this set!",2
"These are wonderful! I have had severe dark circles under my eyes since I was a baby and learned how to use concealer at an early age. Even now when I don't wear makeup, people sometime ask if I'm sick or got hit in the eyes. But when I used these, the next morning my eyes looked completely different. There were no dark circles, no bags, nothing. These are amazing. They've got a jelly-like texture and a cooling feeling on your under eye. There's no harsh fragrance either and they're vegan!",0
"these brushes are crazy effective. They pick up a lot of product and are perfect for creating sharp lines and blending. very soft. however, I would recommend a bigger brush/using something else for highlighting cheekbones and larger spaces.",0
"These brushes work really well with powders, creams, and my stick products. they're sleek, beautiful and sturdy. I'm really glad I got these when they first released. they're all I've been reaching for since I got them.",2
"These colors blend so well and look so much more beautiful than I expected! So glad I purchased this. Honestly, I only bought it because it was on sale, but after getting it and using it, I would have paid full price.",2
"These colors were too crazy for me personally.  I know everyone is different. I went with the pink Alpha Doll for summer. I love the formula, packaging and it wore well. I hope to see them extend to a range of nudes as well in this lipstick soon. The right nude for me, it would be my perfect everyday lipstick.  :-)",3
"These concealers are sheer. It doesn't cover my dark circles at all. I got 2 shades, meteoric and metamorphic. It was too light and dark for me. These are great for highlighting and contouring though because it gives a nice glow.",0
These do a good job on keeping my skin clear and smooth. Also the pads make it easy for application. The biggest drawback for this is the alcohol in the product. It is the first ingredient...and it definitely smells like it alcohol when you apply it. Sometimes it can make my eyes water from it being so strong.,1
These eyeshadows are great. These are highly pigmented and blend like butter. The size of the packaging is great for on the go and I have not hit the pan while using these every day for several months. Will buy more colors.,4
"These glosses are awesome.  The price is great for two glosses.  They are slightly smaller than the original ones, but you get two colors for an even lower price. The glosses went on smoothly.  They were not tacky... the colors looked great.  I will purchase more colors in the near future.",3
"These gummies don't taste very good and I have a hard time forcing myself to chew them. The 8Greens fizzy tablets are so much better- they're tasty, hydrating and full of nutrients. Everyone's got different taste. This is not for me.",4
"These have a nice shape and fit well under the eyes; they don't slide around at all.  They are soothing with a cooling effect once under the eye and feel very nice.  I didn't find them to de-puff or de-wrinkle the area but found them to make my eyes feel better after I use them.  Very soothing, which is what they offer.  I've tried a lot of eye patches and they either side around, don't stay put, smell terrible or do nothing for the under eye area.  These do as they say!  I would recommend!",3
"These lashes were so nice, and held up for quite a few uses. I wore them to a wedding (and unintentionally slept with them) and they held quite well! They're very natural, and look like my own lashes. I love them. Could be worn for daily looks.",0
"These Lil strips are like magic!! I been using them for 2 weeks and my big wrinkle above my left eye is gone!! I couldn't believe it ! Simple, easy to use and they work!! I tried other that ended up wasting my time but not Peace Out !!",3
These lippies are so good! I was surprised with the size because they're bigger than minis. The formula is great and the colors are so beautiful and versatile. I'm so happy with this set. It's one of the best purchases I've made in a while.,2
"These look great, but these as well as teh whispies are very fragile.  The lash line is thin and can easily break apart.  I couldn't recommend either of them for daily wear.  Be careful when cleaning the lash line.",3
These masks definitely give a cooling sensation and leaves skin nicely moisturized. It doesn't hurt that the packaging and actual mask shape is super cute! They do a poor job of actually sticking to the skin and slide off very easily making it hard to leave on for a long time. Hoping their team can improve on this because I do like KC but if you are buying for skin benefits and not IG pics go elsewhere.,1
"These mini lipsticks come in really cute packaging, but they're like an overdose of perfume/flavoring and glitter. The honey-gold color in particular looks really unflattering with my light complexion. This isn't a terrible lipstick set, and it makes a nice gift, but it's nothing special. The lipstick formula is decent, not overly drying, and the color lasts for a while. But the flavors are just over-the-top and the glitter gets everywhere. Even after scrubbing my lips with soap and water, there are particles of glitter all over my face- not cool.",4
"These pads saves my skin! I had a routine down but my skin suddenly plateaued. I thought my routine was getting rid of texture and acne but suddenly the improvement stopped. I went into my Sephora and the employee recommended this as I wasn't exfoliating before. Instantly my skin got brighter, my texture decreased, and my acne started going away! I cannot recommend a product enough! Try this, you will NOT be disappointed!",4
The separate lash system is wonderful but... Lash glue contains formaldehyde to bond the glue. Heads up. There is a better system using this type of separate lashes but with a pliable glue with biotin. Healthy for your lashes. Do your research,3
"These pore strips are seriously THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!! My skin is oily and congested with large pores on my cheeks and extremely clogged pores on my nose. I put these on at bedtime, and by morning I was in shock! There was SO much white gunk on the pore strips! I looked in the same magnifying mirror I looked in the night before, and noticed a considerate difference in the congestion of my skin! The biggest thing was that my pores looked WAY smaller, because all the gunk had been pulled out. AMAZING!!!! I will ALWAYS keep these in stock. ALWAYS!!!",2
"These Powders are beautiful. They blend so nicely and have the most gorgeous sheen to them. I have 2 and 8 to highlight and bronze. 8 is the best bronzer I’ve ever used. It never “sticks” to where I first apply it and diffuses effortlessly AND lasts all day. I have been a diehard MAC MSF Natural user for years but put those in the back of the drawer and replaced with Armani. They just make my skin look so fresh and glowy. I’m in love. I’d like to review the product on its performance, and not harp on whether or not it’s “worth the money.” Every buyer can decide what they are or aren’t willing or able to spend. That has nothing to do with the fact that this product is stunning. I especially love that the packaging is color coded so I know which one I’m reaching for, it’s a nice touch. FWIW I’ve been using these for about a month and I haven’t hit pan.",1
These products are absolutely amazing! Never have had such lasting hydration even is the dry winter months. I use the lip mask everyday as it seems to hold on the best and provide lasting benefits. Some people have been commenting on how how the product is... If you just put it in your pocket or near you for a couple minutes it is super easy to dispense however much you may want. it does tend to get more thick in colder temperatures (think molasses). This is def going to be a permanent fixture in my purse ❤❤❤,4
"These products blew me away!  I tried a sample of the lip collagen serum and I could feel the effects instantly like a cooling sensation (and I could see results after just an hour of on my lips, and an even bigger result since I've been using it a week now).  I was very interested after that sample that I went to my Sephora to check out the brand.  I was very excited to see they also had a matching face collagen serum! So I grabbed both right away, then noticed this kit was only 10$ more than the full size of the collagen face serum.  Oh my goodness, I am so glad I tried all these trial sizes along with the collagen serum! I have only been using it for a week and I see amazing results already in my skin! (the ""ten days to see results"" is not an exaggeration!).  My skin is so much brighter, so much more soft, and so much more poreless! My undereyes look smoother, in fact all my lines are smoother! I am seriously impressed! The sample sizes will last you an extremely long time, I've barely even made a dent in mine. They even have mL measurements on the side of each bottle to show how much product you have left! The serum bottle is amazing quality, feels nice and grabs product nicely! The serum is a tad thick coming out of the syringe, but spreads out so easily and sinks right in! The eye cream is the perfect balance between nourishing and not greasy! The moisterizer is wonderful even under makeup (already bought a full-sized since it was on sale online recently!).  And I ADORE the sleep collagen mask! I love this sleep mask far more than the Summer Fridays Jet Lag.  This one does a far better job at hydrating and renewing the skin than that does.  This is a box definitly worth indulging in and I highly suggest using these products.  If you're skeptical, then seriously get a sample in store, you'll want these products once you see the results it can give!",0
"The serum is really light and not too oily or makeup-disrupting. I do think it's helped my skin tone/brightness, and I think the scent is amazing. I'm just not sure if it's actually worth the hefty price tag. I'm glad I tried it but I don't know if I'd purchase it again for $75.",4
"The serum is worth every penny! My skin in just under a month has drastically improved in appearance. my fine lines are less noticable, pores have shrank to almost nothing because my skin stays plump & hydrated & the tone of my skin has evened out. I used this product twice a day for right at 3 weeks & noticed a difference after the first 10 days. I don't have sensitive skin so this serum didn't give me a proper at all getting use to my skin. I didn't break out once & highly enjoyed using this serum. When buying & testing skincare I always pay attention to ingredients & usually if skin has a step pricetag its because of what ingredients make up that product. This product took no shortcuts in A+ ingredients & the price is justified. I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own. I highly recommend this product to women with aging skin concerns because of the difference it's made in my skin. I have falling in love with the Peter Thomas Roth Peptide 21 set & plan on purchasing the entire set once this set is completely gone. It's worth the investment for me to have nice looking healthy skin for many years ahead!",2
"These smell amazing, which is why I continue to use them but mostly on the smooth side. I find the rough side a bit too rough. Maybe I have sensitive skin but it feels sharp and like it is scratching my face off.  I use the smooth side first and then only use the exfoliating side where there is visible dead skin.  It cleanses really well and takes off make-up. I just wouldn't recommend it if you have sensitive skin.",1
These taste amazing! I've tried a lot of collagen powders that you also mix with water and could never find one that I liked. I also really like that these are travel friendly since they come in tablets.,1
these taste amazing! they are the prefect addition to your water. The collagen and vitamins helped my skin to feel less dry and looked more radiant. I received this complimentary to try and really enjoyed them.,1
"These work! I'm a middle-aged woman who uses her hands a lot: washing, cleaning, painting, gardening, handling tools, masonry and more. But I also like to have reasonably nice nails, frequent manicures, and my professional life involves public interaction which means I gotta have nice hands. Typically, my cuticles are dry, peeling, bleeding and hands are rough like sandpaper! I put these on for the first time and sat down to watch TV. These are not all that restrictive, very comfortable. Yes, I had gorgeous hands that looked 10 years younger, and I was pleased and went straight to bed, slept and woke up with the same baby soft hands. The best part? Days later, my hands still look and feel good (though not like the first day)-- but the effects are lasting. I'm totally stocking up! I did this treatment again more recently before a party-- beautiful soft hands. Four days later, no peelies or nasty cuticles (which I get the next day after a mani). I highly recommend: scrub your hands, put your favorite show on for an hour,  slip these on,  relax, remove and do not wash your hands--just rub the moisturizer in and slip off to sleep.",4
"these work really well, it's cool to see the white dots on the dot after you've worn it overnight. they're not a miracle, but better than nothing that's for sure. helps keep me from accidentally touching and scratching pimples and making them worse and scar",1
"These WOULD I LIE? lashes are my Holy Grail! I own a few pairs of the same lashes along with some other Velour lashes. And seriously, they are so pretty, comfortable and so easy to apply. Each pair lasted me for about 4-5 wears, and then I kept repurchasing them. I have smaller eyes, so it's hard to find a pair of lashes that enhances the appearances of my eyes while looking natural and not overly dramatic, until I found these. They changed the usual trimming and hassle of applying lashes. I used to get eyelashes extensions until my eyes started to get sensitive. These lashes give me the same effect, but better because I get to take them on and off whenever I want. \n\nI bought my first pair in a kit (includes a pair of lashes, a small applicator & mini glue). And I would recommend the kit to anyone who's new to lashes. For only a couple dollars more, you get an applicator and a mini glue that will last forever. I love the applicator but I haven't used the glue yet because I am still using another glue from another brand. I'm definitely repurchasing these!",4
The shade Borealis.. omg stunning! I love all these colors. just different. The packaging is great. I really like the dark green as well. Summer is great for vibrant colors but this is perfect for a sultry winters night. love it!,2
"The shade Goldie Red 25* has a star* for a reason - this color is on point! It's a vibrant red that is (probably) flattering on most skin tones. I have medium/light skin with yellow under tones, and I love this shade. Color payoff is great and it lasts all day with minimal touch ups. The packaging is gorgeous, but I would expect that for the price point (and the fact that it's Gucci). This is my first time trying Gucci Beauty and I have to say I'm impressed. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review.",4
The shade is dark but still works for me. It dries down to a nice cool toned dark brown so I think getting one shade lighter & using both colors will help create more of a natural looking brow.  A little tiny bit goes a long way so the pot will last a while. More of a gel consistency which makes it esy to apply. I use the ABH 7B brush to easily create hair like strokes but I want to find an even thinner denser brush if possible. Once the producr dries down it does not smudge at all even if you rub it but it comes off easily with soap. In my opinion this is the best brow product yet.,4
"The shade match is spot on, as is the coverage, finish, and longevity. Unfortunately, I’m 45 and struggle with large pores and as the day went on, this foundation only served to accentuate them. I was hoping this would be my go to winter foundation because it feels so great on the skin, but I need something that is a bit more smoking and flattering. However, if you don’t struggle with texture you might just love this.",1
"The shades look a little strong in the bottle, but they're subtle when applied and look amazing. I'm usually not a fan of glosses, but I wish cheeky would stay around forever cause I'd wear it every day!",0
The shade was darker than I prefer but it applied nicely and I really like the applicator. It blended out easily and didn't crease as much as other concealers I have used even when not set with powder. I applied it using my normal routine with a damp beauty sponge. I tried and wore it both with and without setting powder to really test it's worth and I must say it performed nicely. The texture is just right.,2
"The shadows are beautiful and so easy to blend. I would personally say the mattes are perfect, but the shimmers/metallics have a more subtle effect. Overall, still a great pallet! Just a warning though: some of shades may temporarily stain your eyelids.",4
"The shadows are pretty and the packaging is stunning, but the overall product is just okay. The mattes blended well and aren't overly pigmented. The shimmers foiled really well with a wet brush. The one thing I really don't like about the pallette is it's strange smell. It smells like burning plastic.",4
"The shadows in this palette are ALL excellent eyeshadows (pigmentation, blendable, wet/dry, finger or brush application, everything). \n\nHowever, a cool-toned palette this is not. Little perturbed Natasha Denona was touting this specifically as a cool-toned palette. It runs neutral-warm & thus may be too orange-ish still on any cool-toned skin like mine. The color Anjo (the color in the middle of the palette) helped the most in taming it to neutral when it really became too warm.\n\nIf you're neutral or warm-toned, this would be a great palette for you.",2
"The shadow texture is amazing....very silky feeling. Ths color payoff in this palette is good.  but you will need another palette for a complete eye look..... There is no classic ""transition shade"". The mattes are very pretty, but you have to build them up and they can be a bit chalky looking. The shimmer shades and glitter toppers are gorgeous. They apply easily with a brush and blend well, but I found with glitters the payoff is better when applied with your finger. A great little travel palette to take on the go for softer daytime looks!",2
"The sleek silver box it comes in is very elegant. The glass bottle it comes in is simple but pretty. When I first opened the bottle, I wasn't expecting a wand to come out of the bottle. I didn't really know what to do with it. The wand also made it difficult to put the top back on the bottle without some of the foundation spilling over the opening of the bottle. The color was a bit too light for my skin. I have a warm undertone, but this was for a peach undertone. But, the finish is very natural and the feel of the foundation is very light on your skin. Also, the coverage is medium, which I like because it looks natural. It also gives a natural looking glow. If the color was right for my skin, I could wear this foundation everyday.\n\nI received this from Influenster for review.",1
"The small hole it comes out from makes it really annoying and hard to apply, it smells like perfume and has a sorta metallicy look to it but it doesn't feel as effective as other peel of masks I've had. I'll stick to the other ones instead.",0
The small one is nice but have to ideal what the larger one would be good for. I recently tried to use it on the new PM palette (I didn't like btw) and it barely picked up any shadow. It just didn't work. Glad I got this set on clearance/sale.,3
The smell of fragrance and alcohol is very strong and I absolutely hated it. It doesn't say it contains alcohol but I'm not so certain. This is just not for me. If you're at all sensitive to smells I'd say skip this,2
"the sponge!!! The spray is a given but I'm buying my second now just for the sponge. I can no longer apply my (IT CC) any other way. Moistening the sponge, squeeze on a towel, spray liberally and press in. Magic",2
"The stand out product in this trio for me was the Sound Sleep Cocoon gel-cream.  It was lightweight and had a light, pleasant smell. It spread easily and not much was needed. I didn't like The bulky package and odd dispenser. The pre-cleanse worked VERY WELL at removing even heavy eye makeup.  I would have liked it to be a cream product as it dripped through your fingers when applying. The toner had an earthy smell and seemed to do it's job. However,  the sprayer was very strong...watch out!  I used all these products for three weeks and received them free for testing purposes.  Overall, I recommend the set.",3
"The subversive shadows are great. My issue is Gold Std. & Lapis both are repeat shades from her larger palettes. Even worst Crimson Fire, Lapis, & Synthetica are single.shades priced @ $25 ea. I know the eyeshadows in this palette have 1/3 of the gram weight compared to the 1.1g singles. Being a Pat McGrath eyeshadow fan. I bought her new shades for $25 ea. when they released. I feel RIPPED OFF buying the single shades with this palette now being for sale for only $26! This the only reason I'm deducting 3 stars. There's only 1 new shade.",3
"The texture is quite thin. I guess that what you expect for hydrogel. It provides a decent amount of moisturizing. It was on sale so I purchased to try out. However, it takes at least 10 minutes to absorb to your skin. Maybe this moisturizer is more suitable for summer, not really enough for winter and drier place. I found it's quite inconvenient when I'm rushing in the morning and have to wait for it a bit to dry before I can apply sunscreen and makeup.",0
"The texture was unexpected, like a runny, but heavy lotion. No discernible banana scent. A little goes a long way. My dry skin drinks this up. I used it the first night and woke up to baby soft skin that looked plumper. It's nice to be able to use something that is not a heavy greasy cream in the winter that really moisturizes.  This will become a staple in my beauty routine.",4
The three blushes are a great combo. I might have substituted  the plum or pink blush for the lightest one and included a brush - then it would have been perfect but all in all a very nice travel item.,3
"The WASO Moisturizer is very moisturizing; that's for sure, but I don't think it's for my combination-leaning oily skin. It didn't sink in at all and left me basically looking like a bucket of fried chicken. I didn't even use that much (less than I would my normal moisturizer). I'm sure it's a great product for someone, but I don't believe that someone is me.",2
"The worst packaging, it keeps breaking,  However, I love this gloss! And their other products.  When I wear a nude lip I put this over it and I always get compliments I’m very fair skin with pink undertones.  I love their face make up 8",0
"They really made a Wonderful product. The applicator is so lush and omg just buy it!!!! I have all the other Dior lip gloss and glows, this one helped my cracked lips after 5 mins!!! I couldn't believe it. This is the best one yet if u want something to help your lips!!! Now I want more of these!!! oh lordy Dior what do u put in these, that makes me want all of them:) but thanks for making a wonderful product!! oh yeah I didnt get these free I paid full price!!!! try it you will love it if you have dry lips like I do!!!!",1
"Thinner, liquid consistency. Dabbed on then blend. Color and light reflection effect nice for dark circles and blemishes but made me breakout. Tried it several times to make sure it was this product causing the breakout.  Sticking to other brand concealer with touche eclat all over brightener that is water based and doesnt cause me to breakout",2
"This actually works. I saw noticeable growth in both brow and lash. I finally have enough lashes to hold mascara! I don't see any skin improvement, tho. Will repurchase for sure. Definitely will add to 20% off love list.",3
This adheres to my scar tissue where I’m missing part of my pigmented lip line. That’s a win! It may come off wen I eat but I don’t know another lipliner that covers my white scar like this one. He color Sexer is definitely fluorescent pink. Great for Summer.,2
"This always saves my chapped or irritated skin, no matter the reason why it is acting up.\nI have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from occasional hormonal acne...this never causes breakouts for me.",3
"This and the Lactic acid are the first two of The Ordinary's products I tried. I was so impressed with the results for the money that I've been trying out every product that seems appropriate for my skin issues and I've yet to be disappointed. I'm 41 and until recently I was having more problems with acne (especially along the jawline) than I'd had in my entire life. I started noticing more uneven pigmentation especially the area between my cheeks and undereye. Because of the oiliness of my skin wrinkles haven't been a problem yet, but I didn't want to treat the discoloration with anything that could damage the fragile undereye skin. I use this all over my face  (except for the eye area) and it's been a noticeable improvement.",2
"This a simple basic eyelash curler that works really well!  I had a fancier, more expensive one that I through in the trash as soon as I used this one.  That expensive one was only about a month old, but useless!!  This one is awesome!!",4
"This, as with most CT items, is a beautiful product. I was a little scared when I first applied it because it is DARK, but it blends so beautifully into the skin...I was amazed. Loses a star for the limited amount of product in the tube.",1
"This balm is mediocre at removing makeup - I still find that I have traces left after following directions thoroughly. Further, if you have sensitive eyes - it BURNS. Like really, really stings. Do not use this to remove eye makeup, or even let it drip into your eyes... you will need to flush your eyes out with water for a good couple of minutes. Otherwise, it smells nice and the cleansing mitt is a nice addition.",1
"This balm is phenomenal at getting EVERYTHING off, I recently took my mini while traveling and I didn't miss makeup wipes at all! It doesn't leave your skin overly greasy either but of course, it doesn't quite replace your cleanser. I'll probably buy the full size after I use up my mini.",0
"This blush delivers exactly what is promised.  I was concerned it may be too light to show up because a lot of the lighter shimmer in compact received of Mood Exposure color.  However, on my light color skin (close to fair) it goes on with a lovely complementary and subtly defining color and glow.  Pleased.",2
"This blush is absolutely beautiful and natural on fair-light skin tones. Not sure how well it would show up on medium-deep skin, though. On my pale skin, it looks like a natural warm, peachy flush and I adore it. You can go in with a heavier hand without worrying about going overboard, which I love.  The ambient lighting powder seems to melt the blush into your skin and blend seamlessly. An absolute genius product. Looking forward to trying more shades.",2
"This blush is so beautiful! It's like Nars orgasm but better! It is very pigmented so use lightly. Goes on so smooth, has longevity, not patchy or splotchy. Best of all its clean!!!! Thank you god for this beautiful clean blush!!",1
"This body oil has a great scent and texture! I bought one to try and immediately bought five more to share with friends and hoard for myself. I like that it absorbs quickly and with little residue considering it is an oil. The scent is refreshing and floral, light and not cloying... highly recommend!",1
"This bottle is everything with it's sturdy glass, pretty blue color and pump application. It's texture is light, smooth with minimal fragrance. It's a thicker liquid that absorbs quickly into my skin leaving it soft and prepared for the rest of my skincare routine. I've never really considered essence prior to trying this out, but now I have completely changed my mind. I'm thankful I received this complimentary for testing purposes.",2
"This box is a great value! I received this as a birthday gift from my twin sister. She knows I've been wanting the Bum Bum Cream for a long time. Everything is great and smells delicious, exactly as described without being sickly sweet. The cream leaves my skin feeling very smooth, soft, and moisturized. It's a nice splurge for someone who just wants to feel and smell good while treating yourself, so I will purchase on my own next time.",2
This brow gel doesnt have as much hold as I was hoping. It gives you more of a softer natural looking brow look. I personally prefer something with a lot of hold so I can make my brow look fuller and fluffier and so they last all day. I also think the brush picks up way to much product. I have to wipe off so much before I go in to apply to my brows. The stopper could be smaller to prevent this from happening. Overall I love the shade selection and packaging. It is a decent product just not my preference for what I  want my brows to look like.,1
"This brush is expensive but you do pay for quality and portability. It is my go-to foundation brush when I apply makeup in the mornings before work and also for traveling, while the lid keeps it sanitary. I use a dabbing/patting motion (like a Beauty Blender) instead of blending or buffing it out on my face. Washing hasn't been an issue but I usually give it 2 full days to dry because the brush head is dense. Highly recommend!",4
"This brush is fantastic for quickly applying one color on the lid, it cover the entire lid area plus a bit more for that perfect look. You can stop there if you want a simple look, add some liner and/or mascara and you're good to go!",3
"This brush was great.  I took wonderful care of it, cleaning it every week.  It was extremely disappointing to have it break after having it a couple of years.  The handle cracked and broke apart, making it unusable. The brush wasn't even dropped. I've never had that happen with any of my other brushes.  It's not worth the money!",4
"This bye bye under eye illumination concealer works great. It is full coverage, I got the medium because I usually wear medium foundation however I felt it was a bit too light for me. I use it not only for my under eye dark circles but also age spots and acne spots. It’s very thick, hard to apply if you don’t follow directions. You have to warm it up first then apply it. A little goes a long way. I like it and think it works great. It says it doesn’t crease but it did for me. I also notice that if I get it to close to my eyes it makes my eyes hurt. All and all a very good concealer, better than anything I have used so far.",2
"This by far is the best sleeping mask I've used and I've tried plenty of other high end ones. I enjoyed the scent not overpowering but a light one, it's  a thick cream of course but yet not heavy feeling also didn't leave my skin feeling sticky like many others. When I awake the next day my skin looks and feels soft, dewy and supple. I recommend trying it.",1
This calming mist is great for my rosacea and incredibly hydrating. I absolutely love everything in this line. This product was received free for testing purposes. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1
"This caused my nose to bump up something horrible. I produce extreme amounts of oil from nose area and I also have larger pores in this area, so I read this description and thought it would be perfect for me. It isn't. my nose got bumpy and seemed to seep MORE oil. This is the only thing I've tried from them that I've hated and it makes me sad, but everything can't work for everyone.",0
This CC Cream provides medium to full coverage because it's so buildable. Its not only great at covering dark spots it provides an SPF 50 to help protect the skin from damage and dark spots! I highly recommend this to everyone and I think it works for all skin tones. It's not only a color correcting cream it's got anti aging skin care properties in it making it suitable for all ages. It also really hydrated my skin which is not to say that it won't work on oily skin. It improves my skins texture and leaves it feeling and looking flawless with an overall brighter and more radiant skin tone. I highly recommend this because it is so easy to use and to blend onto skin with its pump dispenser. I use either my fingers or a special CC Cream sponge I purchased at Sephora which works wonders at applying and blending the product. I can usually skip my Concealer because it has such great coverage. So don't hesitate and know that it's worth every penny.,1
"This cleanser comes out in a gel like consistancy and is slightly runny. However, it gets the job done. It cleansed my skin thoughly and took off my makeup wonderfully and it also didn't make my skin feel tight or look flaky. I will definitely buy it!",4
This cleanser has kept my adult acne at bay! This is the only cleanser I have been using for a few years now and every time I don't use it my skin gets super mad at me! Great for late 20's skin with occasional breakouts. It also has anti-aging properties which is great to incorporate into anyones skin care routine,0
"This cleanser is extremely gentle and the formula is very clean. Its fragrance-free, it smells very clean like fresh soap. There's no artificial scent or anything like that. When you use it it's going to surprise you because it really feels like nothing, but for me that's a good thing. Some people commented that it didn't make their face feel clean but that's because they're used to aggressive and abrasive facial cleansers. This was light and refreshing and it does not strip your skin, it has a perfect PH. It has some of the best ingredients in it, I appreciate that. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's lacking one factor. After I wash my face using it, my face feels thirsty for hydration. I wish it was more hydrating and moisturizing. So this is my number 2, I'm still in search of my number one face wash my true beste.",2
"This cleanser is so thick and creamy, it reminds me almost of shaving cream. The first time I used it, I used WAY too much as a dime sized drop covers the entire face and neck. My skin is very oily but I was pleasantly surprised at how much longer I stayed matte under makeup. At first I was concerned it would be overly drying because the skin is so clean, but I've had no issue there. This bottle will last FOREVER!",3
"This color goes great with my pale skin. Browns usually look too harsh on me but this one's grayish tint works well with me. The pigment is good as well. I use it in combination with the highlighter in ""Lavender"".",0
"This color is far and away the most unique and flattering for me that I've found in many years. (I have fair skin with neutral undertones, blond hair and blue eyes.) It's brightening on the face without being garish, and therefore age appropriate. (in my 40s). It's somehow more of the coral than rose. I highly recommend trying it out! (one star off because it doesn't have great staying power.)",1
"This color is much more orange than in the picture.  I cannot wear it.  Let's talk about the formula.  It is  mousse-like and glides on.  It does not dry down and IS transferrable, the applicator allows for precision and there is no feathering or bleeding.  Wear time 4-5 hours",3
"This color story is nothing like anything else I've seen in the midst of pinks/reds palettes. If you have brown/hazel eyes, these will make your eyes pop! Those gold tones aren't your regular golds either. They have rustic, mustard-green tones to them. The green metallic is a dark, sultry emerald. The teals are so vibrant!\n\nPros:\n-Metallics are very shiny and packs a punch, gives off a ""wet"" finish\n-Metallics are less crumbly than in the Gemini palette \n-Mattes are VERY pigmented; use a soft hand or it'll be hard to blend \n\nCons:\n-Most of the metallics feel dry and gritty except for 2 shades\n-""Blue Dream"", lightest teal shade, doesn't seem to pack a punch and needs more layering than the rest \n-Do your eye makeup first or bake so your powder catches the eyeshadows, fallout is expected because the metallics do crumble a tad bit\n\nOverall 5 stars because this color story is amazing and we need more tones like this in the eyeshadow realm! HOWEVER, for this price point I expect an immaculate formula...",0
"This color would work as a beautiful highlight and can be worn by itself, being that it's a shimmery taupe shimmer with a slight gold glitter.  The doe-foot applicator is supposed to make it easy to apply but a little bit goes a long way.  I prefer applying the product on the lids with a flat synthetic brush like a concealer brush.  Once it dries down it doesn't move.  However, laying too much down makes the texture chunky and lead to cracking.  It works best layered over another shadow rather than by itself.",4
"This combo is awesome! i was running low on my Regenerating Cleanser and the BHA mask and I can't afford to buy the full size of both right now, even with VIB Rouge 20% off, so I bought 2 of these. I have repurchased this set several times, even from the Tata Harper website when I can't get it at Sephora. I have also bought the full size of each product several times. I use this Cleanser daily and can't seem to find any sort of dupe at this point. Same with the mask.",2
"This concealer has a thin, easy to blend consistency and still manages to cover all of my imperfections. It is long lasting and never creases when set with a powder. I worry about my underye area looking dry and crepey, but this formula keeps it looking fresh and dewy. The product is also quite versatile and works well not only under the eyes but over blemishes and all over the face. I recieved this product complimentary for review purposes.",4
"This concealer has a very smooth application but isn't as long lasting as I had hoped. I have combination/oily skin, and the concealer felt like it wore off throughout the day. Maybe if I use a better primer or setting powder, this product would be better for me.",1
"This concealer is a God-sent...literally!  I was looking for a foundation for many months.  I tried so many other brands and types and was getting frustrated.  I got tired of having to return stuff to Sephora.  Then one day in one of my online orders I received a sample of this concealer, which I did not request.  They sent it to me voluntarily.  My perfect shade (chestnut) was among the colors on the pallette, which I tried and fell in love.  Believe me, this is the best thing ever!  It matches me perfectly, does not transfer, has a nice texture, and most of all, does not break me out...and I have super sensitive skin.  I just apply this all over like a foundation and finish up with the Too Faced Ethereal setting powder (which is another great product) and it looks quite natural too, not very makeup looking.  I do not have flashbacks in photographs either.  Sometimes when I want a lighter look, I just mix a little in my sunscreen (Coola Mineral Cucumber Matte...best Sunscreen ever), and its like a BB cream that looks nice, velvety and a natural matte.  When I say this is a real God-sent, it is.  God really cares about our everything.  He saw my struggles and sent me a little help.  TF please do not change this formula or shade.  Every time I find something that works, then they have to go change something in it.  Please...""If it did not break don't fix it.""",2
This concealer is amazing!!! I wasn’t expecting to love it so much! It’s so easy to apply and blend and the coverage is great. I love that I don’t have to reapply or touch up during the day! I would totally recommend to a friend. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.,1
"This concealer is lightweight, yet offers medium to full coverage. It goes on creamy and the applicator glides the product as it should. After applying, this settled into my lines and my eye area looked dry, not what I need at 49. This will work to conceal little dark spots but not for under the eyes. I received this product complimentary for reviewing purposes.",3
"this concealer is not your usual concealer, you need very little and you will need to finesse it a bit. I rub it between my ring fingers and Pat under my eyes,then I will use my sponge if I feel the need\n the coverage is awesome and for spot concealing, perfection",3
"This concealer is super thin and lightweight. It feels like skin, and does not look cakey or harsh, even when built up. It is a medium to high-medium coverage, and I did still need a corrector for my dark circles. It looks really nice with the foundation. The shade is nice for me. It is a little dry, but not chalky or aging. It does not settle into lines or crease on my undereye. It also works great for blemishes and dark spots. If it was a little less dry it would be my perfect everyday concealer.",1
"This concealer only lasts about a year before it gets thin and watery. It's thin to begin with, so if you have super dark circles this may not be for you. I only have slight imperfections so it worked great for me, would recommend.",0
This concealer was better than most but not my favourite. I have terrible dark circles and under eye lines and it neither covered as much as I wanted nor stayed crease free. Still gave it 4 stars because I think it would work well for people with less severe needs.\n\nSmashbox Studio Skin ended up being what I had hoped this product would be.,2
"This concealer will now be my holy grail concealer. \nI wanted a concealer I could wear without foundation, which is hard for me as I have very read cheeks, and the use of concealer is always obvious.\nNot with this! :D \nI only use my skincare routine some days with eye cream and the concealer looks beautiful and dries down very velvety and smooth. \npaired with the lumiere foundation = dream skin! \nI wouldnt say this is the concealer for if you're looking to highlight your face, I still reach for my tarte shape tape on full coverage face days. But I do love using this also on full coverage days! It makes me look so natural in the full coverage :) \n\nI hope they make a jumbo! \nI have dry skin and huge dark circles and this is just seriously my favorite.",0
"this conceals nothing. not sure what the ""super"" is supposed to mean, but I applied a decent amount to my blemishes and under eye circles, and it did nothing. there are so many better concealers out there.",1
This cream has a great feel and texture and goes on very smoothly with quick absorption. I can’t recommend because it isn’t cruelty free (sold in mainland China). The other reason I only gave it 3 stars is I like my day cream to have some level of spf and this doesn’t so I have to add another layer. It does make my face look dewey and hydrated (not at all oily).,1
This cream is awesome! It definitely plumps up the skin and is light enough to not send my skin into oil production over-drive. It compliments their face oil and acts as a great primer for makeup application.,3
"This cream is IT! I have the most dry, angry skin, I also get hormonal breakouts and I have rosacea. This moisturizer delivered a really nourishing bout of moisture witgout leaving an oily film. I use it for day and night and my skin is so much smoother and easier to apply my makeup over. If you have dry sensitive skin then I can't reccommend this enough.",0
"This. Cream. Is. Life.\nHoly guacamole, I've never fallen in love with a night cream like I have this. Usually, when a cream is marketed as a ""night mask"" it just means its thick and takes hours to absorb so don't wear it during the day. But not this bad boy.\nThe texture is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's a gel-cream hybrid that leaves the strangest, silky, slippy feeling to the skin. In the most wonderful way possible. And I wake up practically glowing. This is honestly the only night cream I want to use nowadays and I have sooooo many. Hundreds of dollars worth of creams are going to be purged from my collection because this is all I'll ever need",1
This cream is so gentle on my sensitive and super dry skin! It has a very subtle smell and doesn't feel sticky or greasy at all. My skin absorbs it instantly and looks smooth and healthy. I will buy it again!,4
This curler is great quality. I can definitely see a difference between these and some from Walmart. It also doesn't tend to pull my eyelashes out like others tend to do. I have pretty long lashes and it takes care of them perfectly. Would recommend.,4
"This cute quad offers a gorgeous little touch of magic to any look. I love makeup and I have a lot of it, so it takes something special to catch my eye. These are similar to the loose foiled shadows that Tarte has, but in a firmly packed form. They are firmer and more glossy or ""wet"" looking than a ColourPop shadow, for comparison, yet also a little bit drier, so they are also more suited to double as a highlighter.",2
"This dark spot corrector did wonders for my little scars and fine spots I was starting to get because of sun exposure and age. I will keep on using it. It worked for me but I didn't have any strong marks or spots. I received this product as a free sample, but I will continue to use this brand and get more of their products.",0
This did it for me. I have been on the hunt for a good concealer. They always end up looking cakey or inhance the lines under my eyes. Not this one. It’s so natural with amazing coverage. I received this product for texting purposes and I will definitely be purchasing on my own when I run out.,0
This did not work for me. I have salt and pepper brows and usually get coffee colors in this type product so I can cover the gray strands and match the dark strands. This applicator and product combined clumped on my brows and made me look like angry birds. I had to comb through them with a mascara spoolie brush and still could not remove enough to be able to go out in public. I tried to use a very light touch which I usually do with Benefit Brow brush but it does not help with this product. Just does not work for me.,4
"This didn't do much for me. I got a sample and put it on half my face to see if it did anything and it really made no difference. I appreciate that it is a clean beauty product, but it didn't extend the wear of my makeup, it didn't prevent creasing or do anything special to change the finish of my foundation. I tried using it more sparingly as many reviewers suggest, but that didn't change much. All in all this was a miss for me.",0
"This didn't really do anything to help clean out my pores or shrink them. I don't really have problems with blackheads, but there is buildup that I extract, and this didn't make any sort of difference for it. At least it didn't cause any problems with my skin - it was just ineffective.",1
"This Dior lipstick is described as ""An ultra-pigmented lipstick with up to 12-hour* wear, a luminous, semi-matte finish, and a hydrating, comfortable formula with intense, saturated color."" and that is Literally Exactly what it is!  The feel is luxurious. The colours are ultra pigmented. The shade choices are vast and each one has subtle differences from the others. They yield a bold, semi0matte lip - think the kind you see on Taylor Swift or CoCo Chanel.  They stay well, although you will get transferrability onto your coffee cups and glasses. Long lasting. Does not dry out your lips. Pressing your lips together revives the colour over time.  Over all a powerful lipstick and packs a powerful punch. A great purchase",2
"This does exactly what it says it will. It smoothed my under eye, crowd feet and forehead perfect. I was totally impressed. It you read the directions and use it just like it says,it works perfect with no residue.",2
"This does have purslane (listed under Lactobacillus/Portulaca Oleracea\xa0Ferment) - but does it actually calm the skin?\n\nI have finicky skin - it gets dry (I'm 47) even if it still gets shiny during the day. The humidity and heat in Hawaii makes my skin MAD - itchy, red and bumpy. Fun times. I dropped $250 on this serum out of pure desperation and also picked up her darker skin products (cleanser, hyaluronic serum and both creams). \n\nSturm products are good. Very good. BUT it doesn't quite warrant the exorbitant prices. I'll probably use them up, but I don't think I'd repurchase any of them. After using them all for several weeks, my face was still red and while moisturized, I've had better results from products less than half the price.\n\nThe Calming Serum itself is a nice product (price aside). Fluid, light, hydrating texture that absorbs well without drying out. It layers well and works with other brands well. If you can handle the price - it might work for you.",3
"this dual ended eyeliner is smooth, pigmented and gives you super fine lines. makes a winged liner super easy. long lasting and the packaging just feels like luxury. although the price is steep if you're looking for a fancy eyeliner this is it. you could probably find a more reasonably priced eyeliner to do a similar job, but if you can afford it I say go for it!",2
This exfoliator is so incredible! I enjoy everything from the texture to the smell of this product. The formula is so different from other exfoliators I have used. It gently removes dead skin cells and impurities. I can have sensitivity to exfoliators and I don't notice any sensitivity or irritation when using this. The smell of this is so lightweight and fresh. It puts me in a good mood like if I was at a spa or getting a facial. When I using this exfoliator I enjoy that it doesn't cause any stripping of my skin. My skin is hydrated and balanced. That has to be my favorite thing.,0
"This eye cream feels and smells nice, but I did not see any change in my dark circles. I would keep this for the hydrating effect and primer pre under eye concealer,  but my search continues for a great all in one eye cream.",4
"This eye cream has a bonkers ingredients list! I was afraid my sensitive skin would react to one of the many, but it's great. I first tried this cream as a sample. There is retinol in it, so it can be drying at first if your skin isn't used to it. But this produced such a wonderful effect on my emerging crow's feet that I'm now purchasing my 3rd full size. There is a ton of moisture coming from all the shea, glycerin, peptides and ceramides... there's several other actives for skin tightening, cell turnover, and plumping. You can't do better than this eye cream!",1
"This eye cream is good if you don't have much dryness. If you have fine lines that you're hoping this would get rid of, this would probably not be of any help. Also, another thing to note is that caffeine is a diuretic, so long term use can potentially age the eye area. However, my eyes are quite puffy in the morning, and I've found this to be pretty effective for eye puffiness. It's a very lightweight gel formula so it sits well under makeup.At night, I usually use another eye cream. Overall, I'd say this is a good eye cream for the price, but I would use it sparingly.",0
This eye cream is nice. I notice that applying first thing in the morning really does help to de-puff. My undereyes have brightened a bit since incorporating this regularly for the past few weeks. Its definitely something you want to start using slow. A couple times a week and build up especially if you've never used retinol because it can and will dry out your undereys if used too often at first. Overall I'm pretty happy with it and hope to continue to see improvement in my undereyes! I recieved this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.,0
"This eye cream is okay.. I don't know if the formula just doesn't like my skin or what, but this stuff beads up on me like silicone primers! I just feel like this particular cream is too heavy, and maybe that's really really good for super dry eyes. But this just wasn't for me. Back to the original formula!",0
"This eye cream made my dark circles WORSE. They got puffier and darker and red dots appeared all over them. The effects went away gradually but returned if I started using the eye cream again. I'm rather surprised about it because my skin isn't very sensitive, and I've dabbled in all sorts of vitamin C serums (as well as harsher products, like acid peels and retinols and phenol toner -- I've even put apple cider vinegar in my eyes to combat pink eye, which worked beautifully, actually), but I have never had any issues with a product until now. Shame.",0
"This eye palette is so pretty.  I love the neutral dusty pinks of this.  I wanted to knock off a star for the metallic shade since I can barely get it to show, but it's just such a beautiful natural look.  I have other metallic shades that can pack a punch.  I don't have other colors like this and I'm so happy I finally bought it!",2
This eye primer has staying power and lasts all day.  I have used Urban Decay for years but tried this and I am happy with it.  It is a bit more opaque which helps to enhance the pigment in your eyeshadows.  I would purchase again.,2
"This eyeshadow is so bright and fabulous!  I used it for Dia de Los Muertos makeup and got so many compliments.  It lasted all day, even through a downpour watching the parade.  I can't wait to get more of the colors!",4
this face mask is so good. its so cute because its rose gold foil and its actually cut to the perfect size of my face its still alittle big as all sheet masks are. my problem is they are always usually to big but this one is perfect. the serum smeels amazing like i wish it was a perfume and it made my skin feel amazing this is not one of my favorite sheet masks i recommend it,0
"This face palette is absolutely stunning. I use every single pan in here to create amazing looks. Normally, us oily skin girls have to avoid cream products -- not with the Bloom B&G! I layer all of the products like she does in the video (I highly recommend watching her tutorials), and I get loads of compliments on my smooth complexion and highlight. The blush has INSANE pigment, so I tap into it very gently with my BB, and press/sweep it onto my skin. The color is universally flattering, and makes for a beautiful pale pink to light berry cheek. But girl/guy.. this highlight though. My Lord. Its intense in a subtle way.. it's not one of those, ""look at this blinding streak of shiney stuff on my face."" It's more the, ""oh, what a soft and pretty highlight"" and then the right light hits it and it punches you in the face. Get it. Punch people in the face. You know you want to.",4
This formula is GREAT. I keep switching up to try new thing and I always come back to this. The brush separates your lashes really nicely and the formula is light and natural. It doesn't clump up and make your lashes look crazy like a lot of mascaras do. I highly recommend this if you want nice clean looking lashes.,0
"This formula is way too strong. I really wanted to like it and I gave it 2 tries 2 weeks apart just incase the first time was a 1 off of my skin just not being used to it. Nope, both times were awful.  I can see how those without dry or sensative skin could like it, but this made my dry skin flair up and irritated my skin so bad that I didnt dare try it a third time. It burns so don't go for this if you're not down for the burning sensation.  I really wanted to like it as I received it in a subscription box, so I knew I wasn't able to just bring it back.  I saw a bunch of great reviews and was really disappointed when it wasn't a win for me.",4
"This formula stays on the whole day for me on the waterline, the packaging is very good too, very well made, caps click to close and stay closed and don't open easily, the colors are indicated on the outside, sharpener included. Made in Germany.",1
"This foundation applied so smooth and evenly. The coverage lasted all day and never settled into my wrinkles or smudged off. it lasted through naps, dinner, crying, and 91 degree heat and 56% humidity. Pics are right after application and after all day.",2
"This foundation gives you a perfectly natural finish that makes your skin look like satin. It took me a while in my local store to settle on light 6 since I don't have pink or yellow undertones, but 6 looks just right on my face. I'm very happy with it and haven't used anything else since. I have good skin and can go without foundation, so don't like anything heavy and don't use it every day.  To apply, I use moderate pressure to place a pea-size amount on my l palm and then pat lightly with my opposite fingers to gently tap on areas of my face. After tapping, I can blend it easily with my fingers and it looks perfectly natural...really like my skin only better. I let it sit for a while before using blush, and then an ultra light dusting of loose powder on my t-zone. I tried the powder and it's fine, but not as special as this foundation. Also, kudos for the beautiful bottle and very good pump. High marks all around for a great foundation.",3
"This foundation has good coverage but will not last long wear. I don't know if or what I am doing wrong but I've worn this probably 6 different times already, my face is clean and then prepped/primed. I follow my application with a setting spray and today I even set it with setting powder but it is still rubbing off on my glasses and leaving a large blank space on both sides of my nose where my nose pads press. I normally get makeup rubbed off on my glasses but normally there is still a good amount left on my face. if anyone has any advice let me know but I am not impressed by this foundation.",0
This foundation has medium coverage you have to build up to get full coverage it just won't happen with one application. It is a matte finish and it doesn't feel cakey. It did last on my skin for about 8Hrs. which is pretty good. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purpose.,2
"This foundation has pretty good coverage and a beautiful finish. It’s more of a natural finish than a flat matte. My skin is normal-dry and I have some old scarring around my temple area, it didn’t  accentuate my dry patches.  I was able to get complete coverage with one pump and spot treating the problem areas. I haven’t worn it 24 hours obviously, but after a 12 hour day it was still intact, with minimal fading around the nose and jawline when I’d rubbed. I did receive mine free from Influenster, but I’d also bought it prior to receiving my complimentary foundation.",0
"This foundation has totally saved my skin! I have super sensitive skin, and am allergic to most liquid foundations. I've spent years looking for a foundation that doesn't make me break out, and I think I've finally found it. I've been using this for about two months now, and my skin has never been clearer or calmer. I use it with the Bare Minerals brush with active charcoal and I really like that too.",2
"This foundation is absolutely beautiful... if you rethink everything you know about applying foundation. I use just half a pump of product (no primer) with a brush. I use my RealTechniques expert face brush and work in sections - half my face first, then the other. In the summer, my go-to is the Charlotte Tilbury Wonderglow foundation with a beautyblender... but in the winter I always find myself looking for a more full-coverage base for my pigmented, extremely dry skin. I've tried everything, from Koh Gen Do to Armani Luminous Silk, but this Hourglass foundation was love at first apply. Didn't settle into my fine lines, didn't look cakey, and didn't oxidize (for once!). It seems like this foundation is finicky, so if you're interested, get a sample and experiment! (RawBeautyKristi and Rosie Huntington's YouTube videos were definitely helpful). Think of it as a pigment, not a typical foundation. A teeny tiny bit seriously goes a long way.",4
This foundation is absolutely stunning on the skin and made my skin look flawless all day. It is my 1st purchase by this brand and I am so happy I bought it.  I am in love with the finish and lasting power!!,3
"This foundation is amazing. I think I have fou d a new holy grail. My all- time, top 3 are Estee Lauder Double Wear, Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet and the New Stila Hide and Chic. \nThis. This soft matte foundation is just a show stopper. I will let this unfiltered photo in natural daylight speak for itself.",2
"This foundation is beautiful. The color is perfect. It's lightweight, not drying,  and comfortable on the skin. When they say the coverage is buildable, it truly is and still looks great with two or more layers.   However, I have extremely dry skin with flakey patches. This foundation looks horrible on those patches. I tried everything to get it to look good there because it's so beautiful on the rest of my skin. The only way it looked good all over is if I exfoliated right before applying the foundation.  The weird thing is, I have texture on other parts of my face, like blemishes on my forehead,  but it looked great there. Unless you have extremely dry skin like me, I think you'll love this foundation. I'm talking holy grail status.",4
"This foundation is described as light to medium coverage but I'd say that it is definitely light coverage. Even when using two pumps it didnt seem to have the full coverage I usually like. If you want something light or if you have a pretty even skin tone without too many blemishes, then this would be a good option. My skin is on the mature side (old and rutty, lol) so I need something heavier. I will say that at the end of the day when I would wash off my makeup, there would be quite a bit of foundation on the cloth which is good because it means it stayed on my face rather than fading away or coming off throughout the day. It went on smooth and felt good during application, my biggest issue is it had a slight odor (possible because of being a clean product) and it just didnt give me the coverage I wanted. This foundation is infused with serum which I thought would work to my benefit since I have skin that is on the dry side but it seemed to make me feel a little oily, especially around the nasal area. I recieved this product free for testing purposes but after a few uses I've decided I probably wouldn't buy this product for myself.",2
This foundation is much too drying for my skin. I even prepped my skin with moisturizer and primer. I should have known when the packaging said its oil free. it sucked my skin so dry that it made my skin hurt. This cc cream is more suitable for those with very oily skin.,4
"This foundation is no joke. It delivers some serious coverage, and makes your skin legit look flawless. I personally have very oily skin and large pores, and I find that this holds up on me really well throughout the day. The biggest downside in my opinion is the shade range. I used the Sephora foundation matcher to select my color, and I would describe it as more of a medium tone than a light-medium one. It dries down darker than it first applies, so you may want to err on the side of a lighter shade. The formula is awesome, so I would love to see the brand expand the shades offered! Also A   packaging. It's seriously display worthy.",1
"This foundation is not for me. It was quite thick and heavy on my skin. It is buildable to full coverage, natural finish, with a super long wear. Any skin type can wear it, but I feel like it didn't work well with my drier skin. It accentuated my dry patches. The color was perfect for my skin tone though.",2
"this foundation is nothing like the original double wear. it is much more fluid and feels slightly powdery when applied. it sinks into and highlights pores especially on the nose area, and somehow makes me look shiny after a while even though I have dry skin. it also transfers so much. skip this and just go for the original double wear.",4
"This foundation is one of the best I've used to date. It's a semi-matte finish that is not drying or heavy at all. I use a flat foundation brush to apply the product evenly over my skin then I take a damp sponge to blend out. Over 12 hours of wear with me working out/sweating and it still looked amazing. Never looked oily and make me look near poreless. \n\nSlight con, it does darken a little bit as it dries so I would definitely suggest going in store to swatch and get a sample of this in a few shades/undertones.  Also, there is the signature Dior fragrance and I don't find it too strong however if you're sensitive to scents, be careful.",0
"This foundation is phenomenal! This is the very first foundation that is literally my PERFECT shade. \nI have super dry skin and this doesn't catch on any dry patches and it doesn't look cakey. I do use it with a brush, as the one time I used it with the beauty blender (the black one) it removed the foundation by my eye. That def could have been my error and nothing to do with the foundation, so I am not deducting stars from it for that. Qith a brush, it is absolutely flawless. It also doesn't sink into my smile lines!",4
"This foundation is the best that I have tried, great coverage that last 8  hours. However, like the other reviewers said, it breaks very easily. \nI don't know if it is the packaging or how its laid in the pan cause there seems to be air between the product and pan but whatever, it's awful and causes the powder to crack and break making it difficult and timely to apply.  \nAs a workaround once it breaks I pour it out into an old loose powder jar.....because its still worth it due to how amazing it looks on my face. \nI do not use a primer with it, just a lightweight moisturizer with a little drop of face oil. I apply using a dense brush. If I want more coverage I will apply it over a BB or CC cream.  My skin in normal to dry.  \nEven with the product breaking, I will still continue to purchase because it seems to work with my skin!",1
"This foundation is very nice. it is so lightweight, it feels like nothing on your skin. The finish is very natural, and can easily be adjusted with the skin prep or primer used. I have more dry skin, and I love this with a glowy or hydrating primer. I prefer to apply this mostly with my fingers for a solid medium coverage, and blend out with a damp-to-dry sponge. It needs to be set, but for me just a light dust is good enough. It looks great for most of the day, but does breakup on my chin and creases of my nose after 6 hours or so. This did not settle in any lines or crease in my forehead wrinkles. Overall, I love this foundation. I think the shade was a little light compared to the pictures online, I probably will try the 130 shade next time.",1
This foundation makes me look like I am not wearing anything and it’s very like on the skin. I love this foundation except for two things ...1. Price and 2. When you sweat if runs off like watercolor painting left in the rain. Beautiful on but the sweat run off is soooo very real.,2
This foundation stick is pretty great! it goes on smoothly and blends out flawlessly with a beauty blender. It has great staying power and wears well on my oily skin throughout the day. I do have to oil blot at least once mid day but I typically will have to do that with most products.,1
This foundation was applied as part of a full face make over with a Sephora beauty artist and I loved it that first night. The shade was dead on and the coverage was nice. I ended up purchasing a full size to give it a proper test drive. Unfortunately it did not hold up well. I have combo skin but this product made my whole face oily within hours. It required lots of maintenance. I'll be returning it.,2
This foundation was not for me. Not to say it is not a good product and would be great for others. The coverage is fairly light and I did not find it easy to layer. The color was a bit light for my skintone. I definitely needed I darker shade. The foundation does not provide enough coverage to cover my redness. I also had a problem with the wear time of the product even with setting with powder.  It wore off in several places in just a few hours. I do feel like it has great skin properties.  My skin was softer and better hydrated will using this product. This would be a great product for someone with an even skintone and the need for only light coverage. I received this product free for review.,2
"This foundation will make you emotional. It is perfection. This is the first foundation that has perfecrly matched me. It's been really hard for me to find a dark yet neutral foundation so I'm about to spend all my expendable $$ on as many bottles of this as I can get haha! I put my face on yesterday morning at 8am and took it off at 10pm and it looked BETTER at the end of the day. No oxidization turning me into a pumpkin, no rubbing off my nose or chin, didn't cling to the dry patches on my cheeks. No foundation has ever not settled into my fine forehead and (not so fine) smile lines before this one. I used the Tarte Timeless Smoothing Primer and Urban Decay All-Nighter setting spray. P.S. really look at the shade swatches and models to match your colour. I tried the shade finder using foundations that I was wearing that didn't look terrible and the match I got was about 3 shades too light AND orange...",2
This foundation would only last me up to an hour. When I would apply the foundation it would look really good. I loved the light coverage and blurring effect but after an hour it would melt off and create dry patches around my mouth and acne.,0
"This gave beautiful volume and length and easy application.  I tend to prefer big brushes and a dryer formula, so if you don't like those things, you might not like this.  I docked a star for some flaking- it wasn't terrible, but definitely more noticeable than others at this price point.",0
This gel eyeliner is not for the novice. All the girls complaining about raccoon eyes at the end of the day should keep practicing with pencil before graduating to this product. I've yet to find eyeliner that is more pigmented or has more staying power- and I've tried them all! This is the first time I haven't had to touch up eyeliner in the evening after wearing it all day. Also the brush is the exact right size for wings or creating the perfect cat eye. A,2
This gel moisturizer is absorbed quickly into the skin but does a good job hydrating my face.  I use it under makeup with no problems.   \nProactiv provided me with a free sample but opinions are 100% my own.,3
"This gel works as a serum, under a cream or oil on dry days, and provides enough moisture on its own when there is more moisture in the air. I have milia and this doesn't make the condition worse -- one of the few products I can say that about. I've already re-purchased this several times.",3
This gift set from Origin has a good value. The day and night creams are very nice and make my skin feel rejuvenated.\nI love the toner and the power serum. I generally buy full size Origin products but this set is good for gift giving as well for the travel.,4
"This gives great coverage but it sits on my skin no matter how I apply or blend. Even just a dot doesn't blend well or look good on my under-eye area. The shade nutmeg is a perfect match as it is a good brightener with a hint of color canceling. But the finish comes off a little chalky and doesn't work for the ""very little makeup"" makeup  life I live. I will likely go in store to sample more shades just to be sure. I received this complimentary to sample and review. Of all the Ilia products this is the only one that I tried that doesn't work for me. But it could just be the shade.",3
"This gloss, even though many are sticky, this one went beyond sticky and kept getting caught in my hair all day. It's a decent standby when you foegot your favourote, but I wont buy it again. No noticeable plumping at all",3
"This gloss is so beautiful.  I don't know why I hesitated to purchase this gloss.  It looks absolutely stunning on.  This is my second gloss from Fenty Beauty, and I would definitely purchase more in the future.  The shimmery color just looks great on the lips.  I really love it!",3
"This gloss is so beautiful!  The shimmer is undetectable on your lips (you can't feel it,) but it really make this gloss so pretty and your lips look more plump.  Lots of color for a gloss also.  I just wish it was cheaper.",2
This goes great with the rest of the products in this line. i spray it on first before any other products and after washing my face and not only does it hydrate and calm the skin but it makes the products you put on top spread farther. if i were to pick 2 things from the line it would be this and the cream. i recieved this free for testing from influenster but will be purchasing when i run out as my skin looks amazing.,0
"This goes on really smooth and soaks in quickly for easy makeup application. It keeps my my skin looking fresh and my redness at bay. I was worried when I saw the price but the bottle is huge and you only have to use a couple of drops, this will last me a long time.",1
"This goes on with a slightly weird feel when you first blend to apply it.  But as you pat it in, it blends beautifully and melts in. It can take a second fully absorb, even when you use just a tiny amount, but once it does, it is flawless “no make up” bright eyed  look. I no longer reach for my concealer in the morning and this works whether I do a full face of make up or just skip out the door.",2
"This had pretty great coverage where I didn't need my color corrector, but this concealer was so drying and it creased instantly and throughout the day in my crinkly lines/crows feet around my eyes. Also whenever I tried to set it with powder and a damp sponge it did some crazy thing where random powdery spots would show up. The shade range was pretty lacking on the light side of the spectrum.",1
"This has a smooth texture and just enough color and coverage to make my skin look like it's perfect without makeup. It doesn't settle into lines, and creates a smooth, flawless look. For me the faint hint of color is perfect.",3
"This has become my favorite go to! The color is beautiful for every occasion and the formula glides on. It is like a gloss, so you can't expect crazy wear time out of it, but I love glossy lips... they're making a comeback.\nNote: once you turn the component up, you can't twist it back down. Only design flaw.",0
"This has become my new favorite foundation! I was a little skeptical because I tend to be a little on the dry side but I have tested this with different primers and every time the application is beautiful. It gives medium to full coverage that is easy to build on. It is very lightweight on the skin. I am curious to try this in the dewy formula but so far I am loving the way this wears, and yes it last all day!!! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and to give my honest feedback.",4
"This has become my ride or die blush palette. It's so pigmented, you barely have to dip your brush to get amazing colour payoff! Also, every shade blends and builds beautifully without turning muddy where it meets bronzer or contour.  I can't say enough good things about it. I'm so glad I bought it! I'm wearing Adore Me on my cheekbones and Know Me on the apples of my cheeks in the photo - favourite combination!",1
"This has been a miracle for me. I have combination skin with some redness and sensitivity. This has calmed my redness down immediately. I had a dry patch on my cheek, it's now completely hydrated. This product makes me skin LOOK and FEEL good. I had zero sensitivity to this which is such a good feeling. Definitely my favorite new moisturizer. 100 percent recommend!",0
"This has been a miracle product for me.  I was having such a hard time keeping my combo skin balanced and this fixed that.  I do not break out from it, it actually cleared any breakouts and any marks.  I'm in love with it!",3
"This has been in my loves for awhile, so glad I picked it up on sale, then another 20% off. This palette is just beautiful. Variety of finishes. Vibrant swatches of mattes and very pretty shimmers and satins. That top row is sparkly life. So excited to play with this one",3
"This has been my favorite find this year!  I am fair to light skinned and I use the bottom two right for contour.  The other colors are all highlighters.  The color pictured is not very accurate. on the left, but it is accurate on the right.  You maybe thinking, hey isn't that color in the right corner kind of purple?  Yep it is, but it doesn't translate that way on the skin.      Just use a very light hand, Viseart is high-end, and concentrated and blends like a dream.  Enjoy!",3
"This has been my go-to lip product since it's release (in 2017 I believe). I picked it up because I was a regular liquid lipstick user and my lips were feeling the pain. I loved this ""night mask"" so much I picked up 3 more immediately and keep one on my nightstand, one in my makeup bag, one in my work bag (I do interviews all day and all that talking dries my lips out) and another in my clutch. I use it as a balm/gloss and I can't live without it. I rarely ever even use lipstick anymore (don't judge me).",2
"this has been out for a while and I've been so hesitant on purchasing but I am so glad I did the cleanser and moisturizer are really hydrating and the mask is unbelievable. It really just forces the hydration in my skin, idk how it works so good. I haven't slept in it yet I just let it sit on my face after I shower and leave it on till I'm ready to apply my makeup. It makes my skin soooo soft for my foundation.",2
"This has changed my mask game. I've used it only twice since I got it and I already love it so much! It helped a lot with my dark marks from the sun and acne, its also very soothing and leaves my skin feeling so soft and healthy looking!",0
"this has got to be one of the best primers I've used.  I've tried so many primers and sometimes I get a an ok effect sometimes not so much.  this primer worked with every foundation I have.  it gave me an amazing canvas to work on.  I had no streaks, no dry areas, no oily areas.  my foundation was flawless.  I love it",3
"This has got to be the worst color from Nails Inc that I've experienced.  It took 4 coats and still wasn't totally opaque.   The formula and consistency was so irritating and made me want to throw it out the window while painting my nails.  However, the color is a perfect shade of egg yolk.  It wore well without chipping.  If you really like the color, I would go for it.  The ridiculous number of coats makes me reaching for this to do an accent nail only and won't be in regular rotation.  Overall, the shade is gorgeous but it takes A LOT of work.",1
"This has great brightening properties and smells wonderful. As soon as it's applied, it feels light and it gives that awakening feeling. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 is because it needs to be very well blended or you can be left with small white patches.",0
"this has made a huge difference in my makeup routine. I have some pretty severe smile lines, and by pressing this into those lines, my foundation doesn't settle in this area. makes a huge difference. wish I could find a dupe at a better price point.",2
This has really helped with moisturizing my under eyes. My under eye concealer goes on so much smoother and this jar lasts forever! I'm 6 months in and still have a couple months worth of product left. I never really suffered from dark circles but I do also notice that my eyes are brighter and I look more awake. Definitely worth the money!,0
"This has reduced the squint lines around my eyes, and has significantly reduced the dry looking texture of my undereyes. It is only sticky if you over use this product. Half a pump is plenty for both eyes. Amazing prep for concealer as well.",4
"This has to be one of the worst face cleaners I have ever used. i\nInitially I heard such good things about it after receiving it as a gift. I stopped using my face cleaner I normally use. It left my face feeling really greasy and never felt clean. What made me stop was that my entire face broke out which never happens to me.\nMy face is now on the mend as I stopped using it but it's all flaky and looks awful. I don't recommend that, plus it's totally over priced.",4
"This highlighter is way too pink! It's like smearing glittery pink cotton candy eyeshadow onto your face, and you'd need a very specific skin tone to pull that off. I have light skin and this didn't look good or natural or flattering at all. I'm not impressed.",4
"This highlighter looks very pretty, but this isn't like a normal highlighter with micro shimmer. It's actual pieces of pink glitter. It looks nice but it's not a very realistic product for your face unless you're looking specifically for shiny glitter for your eyelids or for your face for some party. There's no way you can rock this during the day or for any normal occasion.",4
This illuminator/bronzer is the perfect finish for a more natural contour appearance over more opaque foundation that creates a one-tone mask appearance. There's a lot of pigment in this compact. I brush once across the compact horizontally to avoid a striped effect. The cool brush that comes in the compact is nice but flat and can create an obvious edge where you place it on your face. I recommend using a bronzer brush. But remember it is soft and you'll get a lot of pigment.,4
"This includes the tried and true Beautyblender, which is great. Docking one star because it takes longer to get the blender clean with the soap in this kit when compared to the Beautyblender solid cleanser--it seems they have different formulations.",0
This is a beautiful light foundation.  I have very dry skin so I appreciate the luminous coverage it gives me.  It is definitely a light to medium coverage that is a little buildable.  I received this from influenster to test out and was very pleased with the results.  The product lasts well but definitely needs a retouch after 5 hours or so in my tzone.,4
"This is a beautiful powder formula. It is very buildable, does not go on too pigmented. It lasts a good portion of my 12 hr shift, about 8 hrs. The packaging is sturdy and pretty. I plan on getting more shades.",2
"This is a beautiful set of mini cream shadow sticks. The light pink I can wear every day and I don't find it's too glittery at all. The darker taupe is more for a night out, and the gold and bronze can be used a lot or a little at a time. The product goes on so smoothly, and because I don't wear shadow every day, this small set will go a long way for me.",2
"This is a beautiful versatile product that you can wear bold and bright or sheer out. I have only tried on my cheeks so far, but even if that's all I use it for, it's worth it. I will definitely be picking up more shades.",2
"This is a bit pricey for a foundation brush, but it's well worth the cost. Its size is perfect,  not too big or small, the bristles are perfectly even and distributes your foundation smoothly and evenly. Fun to use and easy to clean. Best I have ever used ! Won't go back to regular brushes ever! Highly recommended!",3
"This is a bit watery, has scrubbing particles and smells good. Other than those attributes there’s not much to make this face scrub outstanding. It is mild and it does the job but if you have a specific problem you might keep looking.",3
this is absolutely the BEST face palette that I have ever used. the only reason for the 4 stars is that all the butters and coconut makes my skin break out terribly. I wish they would come out in an oil free version because these are the most gorgeous shades I have ever ever used. both my sisters use it as well with no issues. One has very tanned skine and other has very light skin and it looks stunning on everyone. this would be my holy grail take to my grave product if it didn't break me out.,4
This is a  bunch of awesome products. Careful with the oil. The lid is hard To close ... resulting in me loosing more than half the product. The mask is amazing. Really saw instant result. I would Not recommend This mask for sensitive skin tho.,1
"This is a complete game changer!  This takes masks to an absolute new level and the masks foreo makes are honestly so much better than your standard mask.  This device is so easy to use! When you first take out the mask to put it on the device, it's super saturated and just drenched.  It seems like too much for anyone, however, I promise you, this little handheld device will make ALL of it sink right into your skin.  The heat and cyro functions are no joke! It gets very warm and very cold quickly! It truly makes a difference on the skin and the results!  My favorite so far is the new Acai Berry mask, it instantly made my skin so much smoother!  I cannot imagine my skincare routine without this device anymore, it really just absolutely did so much more for my skin than any normal mask.  The lights so far has made my skin look much more calm and less red. It also gently vibrates on the face, but definitely not as much as the Luna's do.  I think the main selling point of this though is the masks with the heat/cyro function (which is why I highly suggest getting this over the mini). If you can afford to save up for this and can afford to get masks for it regularly, this is something you should really save up for and get.",0
"This is actually a really great product! I dont use a ton of milk makeup products because I have oily skin and they tend to not work for me, but this is the exception! In winter I get dry patches from the air, so it's hard to find something that can handle the oily skin and dry patches. This made my skin so soft and handle both types perfectly! It was very thick so I was nervous, but I used a small amount and it sunk into the skin and gave me a nice hydrated look without looking to greasy. One star off for the smell. It doesnt really smell like much, It kind of smells like a milk bath (duh, I guess) but it's not my favorite. However, I wouldn't say it is scented or offensive at all. I did receive the product free for testing purposes.",3
"This is a decent makeup set with some versatile colors. I couldn't care less about Hilary Duff, and the absolute best part about this purchase is the nice, holographic bag. The products are okay, although I'm not a fan of the toxic ingredient phenoxethanol in the blush stick. \nThe highlighter is very glittery/shimmery and on the pink/purple unicorn color side, which will not suit all skin colors.The eyeshadow sticks are long lasting (a couple odd colors), and they come with a sharpener. \nOverall, this set is overpriced for its quality, but it's not bad. Plenty of you will be happy with it. I'm still undecided.",4
"This is a decent product, but the price for such a small container that does not deliver good resultst is not worth it .\nPros: -somewhat blurs \n-does not get cakey when used with foundation /concealer\n\nCons: -does not brighten whatsoever  (as the description states )\n-price for the little amount of powder you get",1
This is a fail for me and my olive toned medium tanned face. Thought the blendable for all was too good to be true and voila - it is! Even had it not given me a Geisha wannabe look I would be returning it for the oily feel. It feels like pancake makeup from my youth. Hoping it works better for others.,3
"This is a fantastic mask! It's very hydrating and it's just so amazing with the UFO.  It really makes your skin look so much more healthy.  However, this one is my least favorite out of all the masks foreo offers, so that's why it's docked one star.  It's still an amazing mask and I still buy it, these masks by foreo are so much better than any other mask or sheet mask you can find.  This one is definitely meant for daytime.  It's entirely worth the investment.  All of foreos masks are very subtly scented and not strong at all, it's barely there. I definitely recommend this for before makeup or before you go about your day.",0
"This is a fun advent calendar with a penguin theme. As each day gets closer to Christmas, the gifts seem to get better. They are all great items, and Sephora put plenty of variety into the the products, with plenty of great things to get a gal through the winter.",2
"This is a good addition to your Fall routine if you need an occlusive. I use this as my travel nighttime mask to seal in my hydrating serum. Now that it's less humid, my skin feels dry and tight in the morning after using lighter water sleeping masks. This mask does a better job of sealing in moisture, and my skin feels soft in the morning. \n\nIt has the consistency of coconut oil at room temp, so I rub it in my hands to warm it up. my hands do absorb some of it, so I don't feel like my jar will last long. That's the main reason why it's not 5 stars. The cost would otherwise be pretty good, since you're getting 100mL for 45.",4
"This is a good solid acne cleanser for someone with far and few between breakouts. When I stopped taking birth control pills I started breaking out randomly and I use this after my every day face cleanser ( also Clinique, supersonic face cleanser). If used daily I find the product to be consistent and do what it says.",1
"This is a GORGEOUS palette that online pics do not do justice to!  I literally gasped when I opened it up.  There are mattes and sparkles and the formula is amazing! There is a wide variety of muted colors, but you can also use them together easily!",2
"This is a great bath product and it smells wonderful. I'm a fan of the natural ingredients and my mom loves it for her arthritis and aches and pains. I added a bunch of dead sea salts and lavender essential oil to the blend. Yeah, this is overpriced. But it's still an excellent product.",4
"This is a great blend of my favorite oils in one - squalane and other plant oils such as jojoba, baobab, borage seed, rosehip seed, marula and Brazil nut.This is a thicker oil than most so I love it for winter and for my hair.  If you have oily skin, it may not be the right oil for you. It also has micro-algae and that is the dominant smell.  Hence, it is a night-time oil.",2
"this is a great concealer, it lasted all day and didnt crease or dry up. it looks really flawless on my skin. I dont not get dark circles often only when i dont sleep well but this covers it right up. the only downside is I wanted it to be a tad bigger.",0
"This is a great day cream with an added benefit of SPF 23.  I use it daily and it's so easy to apply, little heavier than some day creams but I don't mind because it's blocking the harmful rays that cause aging.  My face always feels so smooth after using it and my pores seem to diminish. This is an amazing product that I will continue to keep in my beauty regimen.",3
"This is a great eyeliner— stays on, easy to use, opaque black. But I received as a gift and can’t imagine buying an eyeliner this price. Sure it’s great quality but not mind blowing. I saw someone else reviewed and said theirs lasted years but I’m not comfortable keeping eyeliner that much longer than its official shelf life (though for some reason I don’t care about keeping powder eyeshadow for years). It’s a nice fancy eyeliner but I’d rather splurge elsewhere in my budget.",0
"This is a great highlighter for medium to deep skin tones. It has a warm pink base tone with a strong violet to hot pink shift. Which is further complimented with matching violet to hot pink micro-glitter. If you own the shade pink moon. The base tone is very similar to Melt's Pink Moon, which does not have the shift or micro-glitter. I took off a star because...had I known the Pink Moon & Illuminacion were so close in color. I wouldve purchased one, not both.",3
"This is a great intro product to the foreo line but unfortunately,  it just doesn't hold up. I received mine in the FFF box and was SUPER excited to try it as a first time user. AND it lived up to the hype! I MUCH preferred this over my clarsonic.  Even went and purchased one for my dd.  At 6 months, I thought maybe I was one of the lucky ones because I want having any problems. AND THEN IT HAPPENED.  I changed the batteries while simultaneously realizing how NOT waterproof the thing is and it seemed like after that I had to change batteries more and more frequently till it seemed like I was putting new batteries in it every month! As for performance though,  I LOVE IT and when the budget allows (or I catch a good sale), I'll purchase the full size original one.  I also found the app to be just ""meh"". Nice idea.  Better marketing tool.  I was never confident that results were ""mine"" and not some randomized program to make me feel like the app worked.  Not worth the extra $$$ IMHO. My daughter's is still working just fine for the moment but I already regret the purchase because I know it's just a matter of time...",3
"This is a great moisturizer! Because of its thick consistency, I can use it as an overnight face mask or skip facial oil altogether. Very healing on days when my skin is tender or irritated. Now that we're entering the dry season, this has been such a lifesaver. Re-purchased my second jar today.",1
"This is a great nude shade. It is a darker shade than nude, but can be worn in the daytime or nighttime. I wore this at work and got many compliments on it. I like that it kept my lips very moisturized.",4
"this is a great primer for the price, it stops my shadows from creasing. but it does separate in the tube and can come out oily if you dont shake it really well. also doesnt grab shimmer shades really well to make them really shiny so I still have to wet my brush when using shimmer shades",0
"This is a great primer!  I'm not sure about the other reviews, but I've been using this primer for a little over a week now and I haven't had any clumping at all.  It does have a thick consistency, but it's perfect for a bolder lash look if you dont want to wear falsies all of the time.  It totally saved a previous mascara that I'd bought, when the mascara itself didn't do enough for me.  This Sephora Lashcraft Primer will definitely be my ""go-to"" from now on.",1
"This is a great product. It is a thick formula that acts like a lip gloss and looks like a liquid lipstick with a coat of gloss on top. It is surprisingly long-lasting but does transfer very easily. It seems like it never dries which is probably why it transfers so easily. I did not expect it to be so long-lasting so I was pleasantly surprised with the product. I recently wore this out to dinner- after a few hours and a three course meal, I only needed a light touch-up on the insides of the lips. If I did not have the tube with me I could just rub my lips together and that was effective as well. I ended up buying several more colors.",0
"This is a great product, it smells sweet and a little spicy, like a snickerdoodle cookie. The texture of the cream feels really nice as you rub it into your skin and it does a great job dissolving most face makeup. A little goes a long way and most days I used a large pea size for my whole face. When you add water it easily turns milky and rinses away. My one critique is that sometimes my face felt a little greasy afterward (I use it in the shower) and I would follow up with a different cleanser to get the squeaky clean feeling that I like. It never burned my eyes but it did blur my vision quite a bit if I wasn't careful around my eyes.",1
"this is a great product other curlers sometimes hurt my eyes and pull my eyelashes but this one does not have that and it curls way better than all the other colours I expected to feel more pain and I did it many times because I was weirded out that I didn't feel any pain at all it didn't pull my eyelashes, it didn't pull my skin. overall a great curler and the mascara that comes with it is a great little extra I've heard so many people that this mascara is great but they don't sell the full size anymore so it's a great little mini size.",4
"This is a great retinol product for the price. The packaging protects the ingredients, it's inexpensive and there is a worthy amount of retinol in the product. I switch off between this and the Farmacy Honeymoon Glow AHA Serum every night. (My skin is not sensitive). Since starting these two products, I haven't had a breakout. \n\nSome retinol products can be super expensive, but this is a great basic way to introduce yourself to retinol in an effective way. If you have sensitive skin, only start by applying this once per week and then you can use it more often if your skin can handle it.",3
"This is a great spray when combined with the Oil and Shine control primer. It definitely helps to keep my makeup on and shine free for almost the entire day. I do wish it had a nice scent though. Overall, it's a setting spray that does the job. I did receive this complimentary for review purposes.",4
"This is a great tinted moisturizer. Sometimes I can feel when I have these products on my face, but this feels like I'm wearing nothing and it evens out my complexion. I apply this with my fingers or a sponge and it blends out nicely.",0
"This is a holy grail! \n\nMy new favorite product discovery and it's super affordable. This mask is great for sensitive skin types and I cannot hype it enough. It applies and blends easily onto the skin without the need of water (you have to use it over clean and dry face) it feels smooth, creamy and soft. \n\nI love to use this mask after taking a warm bath, so that my pores are open and ready for it. I don't know, but it gives you such a luxurious feeling, and leaves your skin visibly better, less oily, almost matte and cleaner after one use. \n\nWhen dry, this clay mask doesn't tingles and gives you a minimal tightening sensation, nothing crazy nor uncomfortable. My skin looks amazingly good and juvenile after every use, that I just want you to experience it for yourself.\n\nRecommended!!!",0
"This is a holy grail product for me! I used it in B20 Ivory and now got it in BR30 Cool Almond for after summer. I have not used another tinted moisturizer/foundation like this and it is hands down the best one out of all that I've tried. I've used this without moisturizer on and it never made my skin look or feel dry or patchy. \n\nFirst of all, your skin looks and feels LIKE SKIN. This evens out your tone without making you look like you have some other color caked on. Glides on like a dream, and you can build it up quite a bit if you first let it set a little bit. It has a very natural, glowy finish, you don't feel like you have anything on, and it gives you that perfect skin look. \n\nIn terms of application, I prefer spreading this with my fingers (clean hands of course). It doesn't build with a sponge, and in fact at least for me that application does look patchy, and it seems to soak up most of the product which won't happen with other foundations. I've used a brush and at least the Artis brush is not that great for it. I feel like the product is so hydrating initially that the product just moves around your face before it gets a chance to soak it in. However it would probably go on beautifully with one of those foundation brushes you use to kind of just spread and ""paint"" the foundation throughout your face. My fingers have been the fastest and surest way for this to go on, and I LOVE how my skin looks.\n\nI first purchased this while I had combo skin (oily w/dry patches) and loved it. Now my skin is very dry due to medical reasons (including rosacea) and it feels just as wonderful on my skin. So far it has not been irritating to my skin despite the fragrance, although I do wear other products under it that might buffer that.",1
This is a light coverage CC cream and you can't really feel it after putting it on. My only compaint is that It has a very dewy finish on my oily skin and I was hoping it would be more of a natural finish.,4
"This is a little long, but worth it if you have dry skin and are on the fence about purchasing. So I received this from Influenster for reviewing purposes, but my opinions are completely 100% my own. I wanted to give this product at least a solid week of use before reviewing (it claims you will see results in 7 days), but I truthfully could have done so in just 2 days. Here's a little back info: I am 38 with some difficult skin issues due to multiple autoimmune issues (mainly Lupus), extreme dryness being the worst. Not matter what I use, nothing seems to help. It is frustrating and very embarrassing. It just so happened (luckily) that I got this at the height of my worst flare up this year (I didn't even want to leave the house). When I read that this was for normal/combination/oily skin- I wasn't very hopeful, to say the least, lol. However, after only 2 days of use- my skin started to make a miraculous turnaround. I hadn't changed anything in my routine other than this product. I am in love. It is a super lightweight moisturizer that feels AMAZING going on, and has a wonderful scent. It does have a silicone-y feel, which I actually enjoy, and dimethicone in products doesn't bother me, personally (if it does for you- this may not be your thing, as it IS high on the ingredients). Some people have said that it sits on top of their skin, but I think they may be using too much. You only need a small amount of product to cover the face (I find that ""dotting"" it all over the face and then blending it out works best to get an even coating). I have been using it morning and night, and my makeup goes over this BEAUTIFULLY! I've even skipped primer completely on ""run-out-the-door"" days, and it looks fantastic. I honestly have not been able to put it down. If you have dry skin and think this probably won't work for you- I encourage you to get a sample and give it a shot. If it helped me- I'm pretty confident it will work for you, too. Really great job, Kiehl's!!!",4
"This is a lovely waterproof mascara that stays and stays. It is the only thing I will use on my lower lashes because there is no smudging, no flaking, no disappearing. The look is natural and pretty.  A makeup bag staple.",2
This is a make-up brush GODDESS!! Blends the powder into the skin so smoothly but definitely need to clean it right after first use because the next day it wont feel as smooth still applies great just doesn't feel as smooth. So definitely a must to clean after every use. (if your like me and only washes every 3 day lol),0
This is a matte foundation. There is nothing luminous about it. Just sits on skin and accentuates fine lines. Makes you look old. Coverage was light to medium despite thickness of product. Fades throughout the day. Only plus was fantastic packaging. I've returned it.,2
"This is amazing for natural makeup days. I sometimes use this and no foundation. I just wish they had a more extensive shade range. I don't normally go for the fair shades but the next shade up was too dark on my NC20 skin. This on me is lighter than my skin tone but I like that for under the eyes. It doesn't crease, it doesn't get cakey and I don't feel the need to set it because it looks beautifully natural on its own",0
"This is AMAZING! It's one of those products you didn't even know you needed until you try it, then you can't live without it. This is top of the line as far as lash primers go. This is a product that really delivers phenomenal results. If I could rate more than 5 stars I would.",4
"This is amazing. Sure it hurts a little, but nothing like waxing. It didn't get the teeniest tiniest hairs, but I don't mind because it actually looks more natural than waxing. AND..... my mustache is gone!",2
"This is a mini, obviously its going to be ridiculously small. The color is brown, but I like brown lipstick so it's fine, its smooth and a cute browny nude. The lip balm is fine, nothing special, but since I bought this mini set for $7 it was worth it for a cute lipstick to keep in my bag and a balm to have in the bathroom or my bedside.",0
This is a must-have for men and women. It does the trick with wrinkles and especially on the neck! By far one of the best products I’ve used on my face especially for the price. I’ve spent hundreds on wrinkle creams. This is a good deal.,2
"This is an absolutely beautiful, grown-up version of the Colourpop Sweet Talk palette. If you love that rosy kind of color story but wanted a more ""mature"" or ""sophisticated"" feel this palette is it!\n\nI love that these shadows are buildable but also last all day, even if just on top of concealer (not set with setting powder). You absolutely do not need any special primer to get a beautiful look with this palette!\n\nI did not have an issue with fall-out or significant kick-up using brushes to apply this product; the shimmery shades are quite glittery but pack on nicely and stay put without making your cheeks look like a disco ball.\n\nI do wish there was one deeper matte shade to balance this palette a little more for my personal preference, but I believe this palette will look stunning on most fair, light, and medium skintones and all eye colors.\n\nI did receive this product free for testing purposes, compliments of Influenster and Bobbi Brown.",0
"This is an absolutely exceptional lipstick, from the packaging, to the shade and formula.It is a cool toned mauve nude that sounds like it would wash everyone out, but somehow manages to be a super flattering cool nude on my medium-olive skin. The formula is also super lightweight and creamy, moisturizing, and also lasts for several hours without fading. I'm hooked! I've also bought Maris' nude, Wolf's red, and lale's red since, and I love them all.",0
"This is an absolutely gorgeous palette and formula!  I have no idea why there are so many negatives listed below. I will update as needed, but I was thrilled with the vibrant shades and creamy, easy-to-apply formula. Stays well (but I use a primer).",2
This is an amazing brush for applying foundation. It leaves a really smooth finish. So far it is now my number one favorite that I highly recommend. Very soft and washes very well. I highly recommend this sephora pro brush.,3
"This is an amazing product.  I read about it and had to try it.  I did what I read and used it 3 nights in a row to start, now I use once a week.  I saw a difference in my skin after the first night.  It is a little pricey, but so worth it for how your skin will look.  It also makes your skin incredibly soft.  This will be a staple in my skin care routine.",3
this is an amazing product I usually despise serums cut they tend to be greasy or leave a film behind  not this it literally feels like you have put. othi g on o cent it so is in I mean you feel so hydrated but not greasy at all and I'm oily.i received this complimentary.,4
"This is an amazing set! Especially getting it while on sale, I couldn't leave the store without it! I am really into foils and creamy shadows and discovering this was a dream come true. If you are into nicely pigmented foils with a buttery texture,  you will love this. I don't see any problem with chunks of glitter at all.",4
"This is an amazing set. It was my first time using a beautyblender sponge and it gave me a glowy finish and really blended my foundation well. The soap is also amazing. I didn't wash my sponge for weeks and when I used the soap, the makeup melted off in a few minutes.",0
"This is an amazing Talc-free powder, that works best i feel for oily and oily combo skin types. It sets the face to e very matte finish that sets makeup in place all day long. However, I find that this powder does not work well with setting sprays, such as MAC Fix . When I would use the Fix   with this powder it would get really cakey and start to separate. It's awful. But without the Fix  its perfect and makeup is flawless. So just something to consider. But this is a great powder on its own.",0
This is an excellent product and I can't recommend it highly enough! I have dry skin and like a product that absorbs instantly and keeps my skin moist and plump. This does that and there's no need to use a lot of it with each application. I love this product!,3
"This is a nice, fun to use mask. I find that it is effective temporarily. That said though, for the price, I would expect a product that does more than offer a temporary fix. It's nice to have for special occasions, but beyond that, I think I'll pass on repurchasing.",4
"This is a nice hydrating primer that I think any skin type can use.  It has a light lotion consistency that gives an extra moisture boost that my skin needs during the cold, dry NYC winter.  Although it doesn't interfere with my makeup, it doesn't extend the wear of it either.  I definitely recommend it and have enjoyed using it.",2
This is a nice light moisturizer. I have very acne prone skin and it responds very well to this product. I knocked off a star because I just found out that Boscia tests on animals so I will not be purchasing their products anymore.,2
"This is a nice powder, but nothing revolutionary. My main issue is how quickly I BURNED THROUGH such an expensive powder. I only used this to set my under eye concealer, and it only lasted a few months. It normally takes me AGES to go through powders. It was fine, but definitely not amazing enough to justify the price considering how quickly it disappears.",0
This is a nice set but the gingerbread scent and a couple of the mega glitters are irritating to the eyes. The blushes aren't as pigmented as I thought they would be. The colors are pretty and the minis are awesome but the irritaion made me consider returning it because not all of it is a comfortable wear.,3
"This is a night mask. It goes on smoothly, melts in to your skin. It has a light mild scent that is best described as ""fresh."" which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, I like sweeter scents. The mask does exactly what it says it will. It sinks and I wake up with a glow. I use retinal, which is known to dry out your skin and this mask definitely helped.",4
"This is another great product from Shiseido.  My skin is combination and my dry spots tend to be on my forehead, chin and occasionally on my nose.  Instead of applying it all over I am using it on these targeted areas and let me tell you, AMAZING difference in only a few days.  This product is just the right consistency for what I need and goes on smoothly.  Since I started using Shiseido products I continue to get compliments on my skin and let's be honest~ who doesn't love that? Thank you for another wonderful product.",3
"This is a perfect everyday palette for a natural look. It is very subtle - if you are looking for a palette with bold colors and pigment, this is not it. I find that it is perfect for an easy, quick, understated look to wear to the office. The mattes are a type of matte that go on subtle and can be built up. None of them are deep enough to create much depth. The shimmers are fine - I wish they were a little creamier. They are a touch on the dry side and need a little work to build up - but not a disappointment by any means.",1
"This is a pretty lip gloss. I like the pink color base, but the golden shimmer seems to overpower the base when the light hits your lips, giving the gloss a metallic look. This lip gloss doesn't really work for me, especially for where I work (which is in the healthcare field). It is still a good lip gloss, just not my preference.",1
This is a product I can't go without. it protects from environmental damage and is just the right amount of moisture for my oily skin. no breakouts with this and I'm sensitive to breakouts. lasts about a year with daily use. I'll never go without it. I use with the matte serum and the powder to foam exfoliant by dior too.,4
this is a product that I can't live without!!! This is a blinding highlight that last majority of my day I work 10-12 hour shift at a restaurant so by my 8th hour it's usually gone but that's impressive since I'm running around majority of the time. whenever I have a bad skin day I can always throw this one and will always look smooth and buttery . I love it !!!!,0
"This is a promising product. I received a sample of this from Sephora in shade 02C. It applied easily with fingers, and gave the most natural finish I've seen. It looked like my skin but better. The coverage is buildable yet natural.  I am quite fair (English rose complexion) so 02C was too dark for me. Impressed by the finish and the promise of this product I went to my local Sephora store to find the correct shade only to find it's not stocked there :( So I can't give it full marks as I'm not sure it comes in my shade. But I can give it 4 stars becuase it has such a great finish and natural look. If you're near a store that has it, go give it a try!",2
This is a really luxurious product! It had a lot of longevity but doesn't dry out on your lips. It also smells really high class. I got this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my review.,0
"This is a simple, pure, absolutely lovely lip balm with nonirritating ingredients and a lovely scent. I've been using the Smith's Rosebud Perfume Co. tins for years and still love them, but thought it might be nice not to have wipe petrolatum and beeswax off my finger after applying. It is. :-) This is also my favorite scent so far. Bonus note: after developing a severe allergy to several of the ingredients in high-end commercial balms and masks, my doctor advised me to use nothing but petroleum jelly to protect my lips. That was...really boring, so I'm happy to report that I've had no adverse reactions from any of the Rosebud Perfume Co. products and continue to use them happily. In terms of ingredients, sometimes less really is more.",2
"This is a staple in my morning routine. It brightens and moisturizes my undereyes. I love the slight ""banana"" tint it gives off while maintaining moisture. I wear this alone or under makeup and it does not make my makeup crease or wear off. I highly recommend this!",0
"This is a thick sheet mask that feels comfortable and cool on the skin but as the time went on the cooling sensation wasn’t as pronounce. It’s a watery type serum with a very slight floral/fresh scent. The sheet had a decent amount of product on it and there was just a tiny bit left in the package. The overall fit was good, maybe a bit small though. I left it on for just over the recommended time and the mask still felt wet upon removal. The serum that was left on my skin didn’t take too long to absorb. My dry sensitive skin felt soft, a bit more refreshed and looked moderately less dull. It’s not my favorite but I’d probably give this one another shot.",1
"This is a thick sheet mask with an overall good fit except for the eye area that needed minor adjustments. There was a good amount of product on the mask but not really any extra left in the package. It’s a watery gel like serum with a very faint scent. Although a tad slippery at first it adhered pretty well to my skin and felt just a bit cool. After the recommended time was up, the mask was still wet so I decided to leave it on for about another 15 minutes. Once removed my dry sensitive skin looked nicer, felt soft, was a bit more radiant and less red. I’d say it’s a good average mask.",1
"This is a very good foundation. It spreads well, but if you're older, or have dry skin this might not be for you. \nIt drys my skin out. I use it for special occasions, because it does have good coverage, just can't use it daily, because my skin is dry.",3
"This is a very luxurious lipstick.  The packaging is beautiful, and this color is very chic. The product itself is nice, but nothing special. It's a semi-sheer buildable color, and very comfortable. Despite the balm like texture, you don't really have to worry about it moving around. That said, for this product, your paying more for the luxurious experience of wearing it rather than the actual quality of the lipstick.",0
"This is a very moisturizing lotion and a little goes a long way. I got this as a free sample from influenster and I'm glad I got to try it! it's best used during drying months. the only complaint I have is, it does feel super rich so if you don't like the feeling of thick lotion I say stay away but I personally really like it!",4
"This is a very nice face oil, not the greatest smelling oil, but it's not super over-powering and it dissipates fast. It's very light in texture,  blends in nicely to the skin, non-greasy. I love that it's all natural! So I don't mind continuing to use it, but I won't be buying again for the price point.. it didn't do anything (been using it for a month now every day) for my skin (acne prone, redness, dryness, sensitive).",1
"This is a very nice overnight cream. I have been using It religiously for two weeks now and have definitely noticed an increase in moisture and I feel my skin is a bit firmer. My makeup goes on a lot smoother due to the added moisture in my skin.  When you first apply this product you notice a very nice light vanilla like fragrance, very soothing for nighttime. I used a pea sized amount and it covers my entire face and neck so a little goes a long way. It does leave a bit of a greasy feeling but don’t be alarmed that’s normal in a night cream and it does absorb by morning and I have not noticed any residue on my pillow case. The ingredients in this product are excellent! There are no parabens, or sulfates and it is vegan! I love that there is less than one percent of fragrance!!! I have been using this product in conjunction with the liquid collagen, I have noticed a slight reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles but I’m not sure which product to contribute that to, it could be both! I would give this product five stars if the price wasn’t quite soo steep! Overall I have really enjoyed this cream and will continue to use! \n* I did receive this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own.",0
"This is a very stiff lip balm, great for winter, especially if you spend any time outdoors. If you're looking for thin fashion lipgloss, look elsewhere. If you want something that will really protect your lips and stay on, this stuff is great! I'm guessing it'll last a long time, too, because a little goes a long way.",3
"This is a wonderfully refreshing rosewater mist. The spray doesn't feel like a water hose, the smell isn't overwhelming and it is a nice way to relax. I also use this as a setting spray occasionally, but would recommend it as more of a refreshing product than a setting spray.",4
This is a wonderful set. Both these products work great together especially in the winter for my dry skin. Some reviews mention the price being $59 on the Caudalie site but if they had read the complete description they would have seen that the set Caudalie is selling contains a full size seum but only a 25 ml moisturizer. While the Sephora set has both full size serum and 50 ml moisturizer. Please look at the full description when leaving such reviews because it can deter others from the correct information. Overall love both products and highly recommend for the colder months.,1
"This is bang on Givenchy! From the packaging to the formula, I love it all. Givenchy lipsticks always have such a lux weight to them. And the limited edition packaging is too cute. \n\nThis is lightweight, comfortable to wear, long lasting, and not drying. it's a bright cool red that is very wearable. \n\nJust for reference, I am light to medium skintone with a neutral undertone.\n\nThe decorative limited edition cap would totally be reusable.\n\nI was so surprised to see that the colour had barely warn off on the centre portion of my lips by the end of the day. Even after drinking coffee, juice, and even eating vermicelli ""soup"", it was still rouge. It wasn't even worn off enough for me to touch it up again.",2
"This is basically a glorified pore filler, just a lot of silicone coating.  I can smell the vitamin C in it and it itches a little when I put it on so I know it must do a little something.  But I used it to the end and noticed me difference in my scars.  Also, the ""airless"" pump never worked properly, kept spitting out air.",2
"This is beautiful, finally something that matches my skin.  I am a little oily in my t-zone, kind of worried it's going to slip off.  But I am a flight attendant, and think it will be great on the extremely dry plane.",4
"This is by far my favorite liquid liner! I've tried so many liquid liners, I can't even tell you how many and this one wins. \nThe application is seamless. It goes on flawless everytime. I don't struggle with it or with getting a sharp point. \nI will definitely be repurchasing. I know it's on the spendy side for an eyeliner but I recommend purchasing it. It's so worth it.",1
"This is, by far, my new favorite mascara. Goes on easy, does NOT require multiple coats, stays put, and isn't a PITA to take off at the end of the day. No flaking, no smudging, no clumping. In a word? Perfect. This is my new go-to.\nAlso, noticed some reviews complained about the fragrance? To me, it smells very lightly of honey, which is so much better than the distinctive peppery scent I associate with other mascaras. Ymmv.",2
This is by far the best brush cleaner I have used.  I recently switched to Kat Von D True Portrait foundation and I grabbed some other stuff ( it cosmetics brush cleaner) to clean my brushes while on a trip. Needless to say my foundation brush still had foundation on it until I got home and used this This stuff works for anything and is super quick and easy to use.,2
"This is by far the best liquid lipstick I have ever used. When I first tried it the consistency was intimidating because it is a thin liquid and it was difficult to stay in the lines of my lips but after some practice it's the lipstick I use the most out of my collection. It's not drying, it doesn't flake or build up in clumps like some liquid lips and it last ALL day without having to reapply it. The thing that I love the most is that it's not noticable at all, it doesn't feel like I'm wearing lipstick and I usually don't remember that I am until I catch myself in the mirror. This shade is stunning and loaded with pigment.",0
This is by far the most beautiful shade and most complimented lipstick I own. The brownish rose is the perfect rose lip for everyday and night out. The finish is matte and moisturized and lasts all day for me working in a psych hospital. I recommend the trip if you want to try it but believe me you will want a full size! love it!!,0
"This is clearing my skin better than any product I have ever tried before (prescriptions included). My red spots are fading, and I am not getting breakouts like I was before. It started by purging my skin of the issues lurking underneath, but in less than a week, my skin was turning for the better. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product is amazing. It does burn when you first use it, but it goes away quickly.",4
"This is definitely a 'less is more' foundation - if you need a FULL coverage foundation, this probably isn't for you since it is on the light to medium side. That's what I like about it, though. You can build it up, but all in all, it's not heavy. I find one pump, maybe a little more, is all I need, and it blends well with a damp beauty sponge. A bit of powder, some setting spray, and this is good at holding up all day. What I love about it? Is when I come home from work, I'm not rubbing at my face to get my makeup off, like I am with other foundations - this 'feels' good because it is so lightweight and doesn't make my skin oily, and it does provide a nice, natural finish.",2
This is definitely going to be one of my top mascaras! I had a mini size and I'm so impressed. It added volume and amazing length with just one coat! Very black and never clumpy. I will definitely be buying this. One star less because it's pricey but I do love it!,3
This is definitely my secret ingredient to flawless looking skin. I have to do is take the pom-pom and dusted over your skin I’m really heavy handed with it because I like a lot of shimmer. People always say while you’re skin is flawless  and this is my secret.,0
"This is definitely one of Natasha denonas worst performing palettes.  It's just ""ok"".  For a high end name brand, it shouldn't be performing just ""ok"", even if it is a mini.  The lavender shade and the shimmer whitish-silver-blue shade both preform Extremely well.  I adore that lavender shade.   However, the middle three shades are really quiet patchy.  They just don't show up that great either on the lid and are hard to blend.  I'm just not super impressed because of that.  It's not up to Natasha Denonas eyeshadow quality we all know.  I would honestly say pass and literally get any other palette from ND. This one for some reason just isn't up to par.",0
"This is definitely worth the price tag. This shade is perfect for my skintone. This is by far the best lipstick formula I have found. It goes on super creamy and smooth, like a balm,  and it's not drying on the lips.  Very comfortable to wear.  Some have posted it had little wear time but that is not what I have experienced.  I usually have to re-apply after meals, but even then it's still pretty intact. Also,  my husband thinks I'm crazy for buying sick an expensive lipstick,  so worth it!",4
This is exactly what I was looking for in a color. I have a lot of bold red and purples but I wanted a nice nude color that I could wear casually with anything. Its light brown with a coral undertone which is great since i look good in oranges and reds and not so much in pinks. \nI didn't need to apply a lot of product to fully cover my lips which is also a plus because it will last longer and doesn't feel too think on the lips. \nIf you like coral colors but don't want anything too bright this is your go to color. I highly recommend it. It's worth the price!,0
"This is exactly what I was looking for in a highlighter.  I hate glitter or noticeable sparkle on my face and I've had such a hard time finding a highlighter without that.  I'd swatched this in store many times and didn't get the hype because it didn't look like anything but after talking to Shelly from Geek Out of Water on YT, I'm so glad I finally picked it up.  It gives a wet looking sheen that doesn't emphasize texture and is easy to blend or build up.  It's just beautiful!",2
This is excellent eyebrow powder. I have very sparse eyebrows due to cancer treatment and this powder gives very good coverage and is easy to use. The color is beautiful and there are tiny sparkles but it does not look at all overdone or “sparkly”. In fact it looks very matte. An excellent eyebrow product.,4
"This is fabulous! I have oily skin and I was kinda concerned because usually if I use something that promises dewy skin, I get more greasy.  But actually does what it says! I love how my skin looks after just a couple of weeks of use. Get this y'all! It's soooo worth it!",2
"This is greasy and sits heavily on my dry skin. Even worse, it pills. Terribly. If I try to massage it into my skin, it even pills on itself. If I pat it on, it just sits on top of my skin. It also causes irritation/redness and small surface breakouts. I have used other Vitamin C products with no issue. What works for me is a Vit C serum with my favorite moisturizer on top.",2
"This is great for my combination skin! I have issues with dryness at the same time as I break out, and it's perfect for dealing with that! It also smells great, and the bottle has a pretty fine mist that works well.",2
"This is great for the price point but in reality it doesnt really last too long.  My face didn't feel overly ""clean"" using this cleanser and the moisturizer really has to get rubbed in because it goes on white, kind of like sunscreen. I dont regret this purchase but I wouldn't purchase it again.",1
"This is hands down my favorite sleeping mask. It feels so good going on, very cooling & relaxing after a long day! Then when I wake up in the morning & was it off, it's like my skin has been recharged overnight. I love the glow it gives me.",4
This is hands down the worst mask I've bought. And I buy a lot of these. It's too thick to conform to your face so parts kept pulling up and I spend the 15 minutes trying to keep it on as much of my face as possible. Was definitely disappointed because I love the regular Sephora brand sheet masks. Never again.,4
This is honestly one of the better Hum products that I’ve tried. My digestion has changed but what I really have noticed is my skin. My skin is more glowing than it was a few weeks ago when I started taking it. I have noticed I am getting more breakouts but I think I need to take it longer to really be able to tell what the breakouts are from.,0
This is horrible! I wore it 2 days and got a cystic zit on the very Front of my cheek! The Mario Badesco acne treatment even not working on it! Can I take it in and return it after ordering it? I would give it ZERO STARS if it would let me!!!,3
this is hydrating if you don't have super dry skin. I switched my skin routine to using all dr. jart. it was okay but I've had a lot of breakouts and dryness since starting this routine. may be coincidence but I'm not impressed. \nthe product itself feels nice. I'd recommend it to someone with normal skin.,1
This is incredible！I first got the green neon，I thought the color payoff is so pale of that palette，and nothing special shades for me. However，this orange one is incredible！It is sooo Neon and has an intense color pigmentation！The topper shades are so glittery， sheer and also beautiful to bring the palette much more fun. I can see lots of possibilities with this orange one！,4
"This is it! After a lifetime of trying to find a good mascara, I finally found one that doesn't irritate my eyes and makes my lashes look good. I'm not a super makeup expert so I appreciate how easy this wand is to use and DANG this mascara finishes off my look perfectly.",3
"This is just not good. I strayed from my typical eyebrow pen from Ardell (which is my holy grail) because I am a fan of Stila's liquid liner. I agree with reviewers that the undertones of this are pretty good, you don't get a weird reddish looking tint. But that might be because you don't really get a tint at all. I'm pale and blonde but I guess have fairly medium brown eyebrows so I got the medium and it barely swatches on my brows. And having been using strictly eyebrow pens, I know to store them properly upside down in a holder. I'd skip this one and definitely try Ardell's for a third of the price.",0
this is literally my favorite lip product ever! it leaves your lips so soft and plump and it smells soooo amazing. I've purchased the original flavor like 3 or 4 times and this is my first time using a different flavor and I love it. the originals still amazing but this one is just so fun and puts me in the holiday spirit while still giving me the same benefits as the original.,0
"This is literally my favourite palette. The possibilities for cute fall looks are endless!! Theres not one colour that I don't use regularly, and that's pretty rare for me. Minimal fallout, super pigmented, and easy to blend. Ive had no issues with this palette. Its absolutely amazing.",0
"THIS. IS. MAGIC. I have tried a zillion foundations, but this one is next level. ELDW has been my daily go-to for years, but this is definitely a new favorite. Whoever said this is like an Instagram filter in a bottle nailed it on the head. I am 40, and this foundation blurs any texture on my skin, doesn't settle into fine lines, and looks absolutely gorgeous and glowing. I look 10 years younger when I put it on. I mean perfect natural finish! I apply mine with a damp beauty blender, and it never gets cakey. It's buildable too...I often add a little extra over my sun damaged areas. But I can cover my face with a single pump. I would give this foundation 4.8 stars really. It's only flaw is that I do find this isn't quite as long-lasting as my Double Wear. I save my DW for the days I have 12-hour shifts at work, and use this one for 8-hour work days and off days. If this really looked as good at 12 hours as it does in the first hour, I would never buy another foundation again. Period. For me, this looks great up through the 8-hour mark, then it starts to wear down.",1
"This is my 1st purchse of this brand, and after trying sooo many different self tanners, this is BY FAR superior.\nIm fairly light skinned and this worked perfectly for me! Wasn't even the slightest bit orange. I left it on all night and washed it off in the morning. I placed an old towel underneath me just in case but it didnt transfer at all! It also had very little smell compared to most.\nTotally recommend this product and will def be purchasing this again as its already became my favorite.. EVER!",3
This is my 3rd tube of the ABH brow gel.\nThe first one I had was just a plain spoolie but the 2nd and 3rd tube comes with a spoolie that has shorter bristles on one end to really deposit the color and a side that has longer bristles to brush the color evenly. I like this WAY better than the Dipbrown gel. This one gives me just the right amount of color and it's easier to control without getting blobs of product on my brows. This doesn't make my brows look that much fuller but I do like that it gives my brows some color definition after using the brow pomade and wiz (I know! i use so many things for my brows haha). It also does a good job of keeping everything in place throughout the day. It also stays put even after doing a hard workout!,1
"This is my absolute favorite cleanser. I've tried lots of other cleansers from fresh, La Mer, Kate Somerville, etc., but this is the only one I've purchased multiple times. I think I've bought about six or seven bottles of this by now. I have really sensitive, acne-prone skin that can't handle anything too stripping or too oily. This is a great, simple gel cleanser with a reasonable price tag. It works perfectly as a second step for double cleansing at night and a quick wash in the morning. I'll keep purchasing this as long as it is available.",0
"This is my absolute favorite sunscreen to apply before makeup. It has a thin non-streaky formula that absorbs into the skin flawlessly without absolutely no white cast. After trying so many others, this one doesn't break up makeup and doesn't make me more oily than I already am. It's so lightweight and feels just like an everyday moisturizer. Just wish it wasn't so pricey, since I use it everyday!",4
This is my absolute freaking favourite lipstick. I own four colours by Becca. Look no further for another lipstick as brands like YSL and UD don't compare (in my very honest opinion). It's so silky and smooth. The colours are absolutely amazing and beautiful! Everything about this lipstick is wonderful down to how awesome the tube is. I cannot express enough how much I love this lipstick.,0
"This is my all-time favorite ""foundation"" for every day - it was out of stock online and in stores everywhere (believe me I checked) for about a year and I struggled to find something to compete and my skin definitely suffered. It really feels like skincare in a bottle  when it comes to helping improve your natural skin tone and texture over time The cream consistency alone is worth writing home about. While it feels somewhat thick out of the tube, it glides on and blends into skin like a dream. I use a hydrating primer with this particular CC cream because it really helps 'set' the CC cream all day \n long despite the products claims to prime, and it also helps give the skin that extra glow. Really, this is a must have and I hope it doesnt go away again! The only thing I will say is that if you're acne prone or your skin needs extra coverage, this ma be a good base, but you may need additional coverage as this is very natural looking and ""light"" on the skin.",0
This is my fave palette currently! I use it almost every day and I love each shade. I'm quite fair and have blue eyes and I feel the pinks match my skin tone so well. I love playing with thus palette :)!,1
"this is my favorite brown cream eyeshadow. it's such a pretty brown that isn't too cool or too orange, and can be worn without a full eye look. I can just swipe it on with my finger and it looks pretty and lasts all day. The color complements my green eyes well.",4
"this is my favorite by far. been using for a few years now. deep black color, lasts all day for the most part, which is rare for me due to slightly oily lids. not dry, easy to apply. I have tried other expensive cult favorites, and this is way better.",2
"This is my favorite color story it's neutrals 2.0 with greens done perfectly. The mirror is big, shade names are below the shadows, the pan size is wide enough to fit any eyeshadow brush I own and it's good quality caedboard packaging. Plus the outside artwork is beautiful.",1
"This is my favorite foundation. I tried many foundations. I even bought $250 La Prairie foundation but I came back to Nars again. It makes my skin look healthy, vital, glowy just beautiful and I love color selection, so hard to find foundation for a very fair skin.",1
"This is my favorite! I've tried almost every kind and this is the one I always go back to! It's natural looking, non sticky, not smelly and easy to apply and is fast! It makes me look natural and tanned.",1
"This is my favorite lip product (in Cherry). I originally started buying this because Benefit Cosmetics discontinued Benebalm, which gave a ""your lips, but better"", ""bitten"" effect.  But actually, I like this better!  The only thing superior about the Benebalm was the rose scent.\nThis is absolutely perfect for every day. I hope Clinique never stops making it.",3
"this is my favorite liquid lip formula because it's so comfortable, easy to apply, and it comes in tons of colors. This set is nice for someone wanting to get the most bang for their buck with all wearable shades.",0
This is my first Charlotte Tilbury product I own and I have fallen in love with this lipstick! It is so creamy and pigmented. I get compliments all the time when I wear this. It is also very luxe; the bullet itself is beautiful and weighted. I highly recommend!! Can't wait to get more!,2
"This is my first Ciate eyeshadow palette.  The shadows are pigmented and the glitters are great, they have great color and glitter payoff. I can create a glam look or an ever day look, so it's versatile. Quickly becoming one of my most used and favorite palettes.",3
This is my first cleansing oil and I use it as a first cleanse to take my makeup/spf off. It does a great job of taking everything off and it doesn't burn my eyes. If some does get in my eyes it kinda makes them cloudy but it goes away in a couple of seconds.,4
"This is my first electronic face cleanser and I absolutely love it. It removes all of my makeup and my skin feels so soft after using it, it's like I've just exfoliated. Battery life is amazing too, I've had it for months and only charged once",0
this is my first experience with a wander beauty eyeshadow palette and I love it. these colors are right up my alley. they are pigmented and smooth and they blend easily. fallout is minimal as well. i do apply blitz and avenue with my finger. this is a perfect everyday neutral palette but you can definitely amp it up for night time. OTW is a fantastic crease shade. I have been using this everyday since I got it. I definitely want to try other palettes from wander beauty!,2
"This is my first fine point brow pencil and the head of a pin is probably the same width as this. If you like subtle, but defined then this is for you. Personally, I'm more into the dramatic Instaglam brows, but I do like this to fill in the sparse parts at the tail of my brows.",0
"This is my first Guerlain purchase. I have brown hair and brown eyes but I'm rather fair so I went with the lightest shade bc I didn't want anything too over powering. So I am happy w my purchase. It gives beautiful warmth to the skin. There is a scent but it is not unpleasant.  I cannot put my finger on what it is but I don't mind it. I took a star off bc I think for the price, the packaging is not as elegant as I would have liked. I won't go as far as to say cheap but it just slightly thick plastic. I hope it doesn't break over time. Otherwise it is a nice warm bronzer suitable for fair skin!",4
"This is my first hourglass product and I've used it everyday since I've bought it. I love the bronzer,  it's looks neutral on my skintone so I  ""brontour"" with it. The only thing that didn't work was when I tried using the lightest shade to set my under eyes and I ended up looking like a creasy mess, so I just use it to highlight the center of my face.",1
"this is my first huda palette - I was intrigued by the colors! such a beautiful and fun range of colors to play with. the pigmentation IS there, I'm not too sure why it even got bad reviews although everyone has their opinion. I love all of the shades and know they will work anytime of the year.",4
"This is my first purchase from Huda Beauty.  I have nothing against the brand; I just haven't found anything that interested me enough to buy from the brand until this palette was launched.\n\nI'm overall very pleased with my palette.  I've used it four times now, twice with primer and twice without, and have not experienced any problems, certainly not the problems that some others have had. The metallics and shimmers go on smooth and pigmented with a brush, maybe a little more saturated with a finger, but I hardly ever use my fingers unless necessary.  In fact, I never bothered swatching the eyeshadows and just went straight in with a brush when I first got it.  I didn't have to use a stiffer brush and find normal and soft ones work fine.  The texture reminds me a little of the Japanese eyeshadows with the slurry technology, and they apply similarly to me, except with more pigment.  None of mine have developed a hard pan or film either.\n\nThe mattes aren't creamy like Natasha Denona's (everyone's standard nowadays, it seems), but they're still pigmented and blend well.  Vortex (the dark purple) was a little grittier, though.\n\nThe glitter shade Nebula is great!  It adheres well and has a fine glitter.  The reflective toppers are just that, so apply them with a finger or a stiffer/damp brush.  Gold Glitch can probably be used as a lid shade because it's pigmented enough.\n\nAbout the colour story.  I don't think it reads as spring-summer.   It's definitely cooler toned with all the pinks and blues, like an icy wintery scene.  It reminds me of Disney's Frozen, think Elsa.  Lol!  I think the peach and rose tones throw people off, but the palette is cool overall.  \n\nI hope this review helps others on the fence.  I know people either hate or love Huda Beauty.   I could care less about the brand.  I read the complaints, didn't experience any of the problems, and am glad I purchased it.",2
"This is my first repurchase of this product. I missed it in my skincare routine. When I finished it, I thought I would try a similar, less expensive product. It did not work as well. I like the quality of ingredients and I saw results after 2 weeks this time.",1
"This is my first review, ever! I feel it's necessary to let others know how wonderful, light, refreshing, and moisturizing this is. It's one of my favorite parts of my skin care routine. No problems with this item what so ever.",0
"This is my first review on Sephora, and I am so over the moon about this product. I will start off by saying the price point is a little high, even for the .5 oz sizes, but for how amazing this primer is I will gladly spend the money. My skin has always been crazy oily in my t-zone and I've tried all kinds of different products, and none gave me results I wanted. I just recently got this and a few other Dr. Brandt samples with my reward points and this primer wowed me. I did my normal makeup routine without it once I ran out and I immediately went and bought the full size because my makeup just was not the same. I love that it has tea tree oil in it, and it makes my skin baby smooth after application. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone struggling with oily skin!",1
"This is my first stick concealer. I've mostly been using liquid concealers with doe foot applicators primarily Nars and Shape Tape. The problem was they never really covered my dark circles and tended to make my undereye area look dry, accentuating my fine lines. Then I saw a beauty guru explain why stick concealers are better for mature eyes. I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered Marc Jacob's. It is so creamy and easy to blend. You can apply it directly from the stick and use either your finger or a concealer brush to blend it out. I was so happily surprised! It covered my dark circles with just the smallest amount, didn't crease and made my undereye look hydrated and smooth. It wears well with only slight creasing. If I set it with my Dermablend loose powder it stays looking perfect for hours! I'm so impressed I purchased a second one with my VIB Haul. I've finally found my ride or die!",4
"This is my first wander beauty product and I love it. It gives great natural length and volume. It is not clumpy and does not irritate my eyes. I received this complimentary for testing purposes, but I’ll be buying this!",0
"This is my first YSL lipstick and I bought it on a whim during the last Rouge sale. I have way too many lipsticks, which means I have a lot to compare this one - and it is easily in my top 5. I was blown away at the staying power - it stayed for hours and hours. When I saw myself in a mirror about 6 hours after applying, it looked like it was just applied. I'm not talking about the vague stain that many lipsticks have - it was still opaque. The formula is slightly hydrating and applies smoothly in one swipe. It even looks great without a liner. Now I am back online looking for my next YSL lippie - this one is that great!",3
"this is my fourth or fifth time buying this! it works so well!! it is very light and moisturizing. I used to have oily skin with acne all over my face, but now I just get one or two throughout the month. also it is less expansive than the brand I used to use!",0
This is my go-to bronzer. It's absolutely gorgeous and looks so natural. It blends beautifully and after two months of daily doesn't even look used at all. I'll probably buy one shade darker for the summer and keep this one for fall/winter.,4
"This is my go-to daytime moisturizer/tint and has been for  years--it's silky smooth, has SPF 30 (we all need sunscreen), and is so sheer that people think I just have really good skin. Thanks, BareMinerals!",3
This is my go to night cream. It’s thick but not oily and I think my skin looks firmer. I don’t breakout. I’m 48 and think my skin looks pretty good. The cream last a long time while the serum that goes with it seems to run out really fast. So I sometimes use with other serums.,2
this is my go to!!! the shades are beautifully crafted and have the most amazing pigment... blends like a dream and lasts all day. I get so many compliments when I wear this. I honestly dont think I could be without this palette. I purchased this once it launched and I will most definitely repurchase when I run out.,1
"This is my go to toner.  I've purchased this 3 times already and will continue to keep it in rotation.  I normally use a regular toner, sometimes rose toner before this to completely cleanse the skin after a gentle wash. I then follow up with the Ordinary toner as a treatment.  I have normal to dry skin along with hormonal acne. This product works!!",2
"This is my newest go-to finishing powder. I love the smooth, flawless application that doesn't ever look gritty or cakey. The sheer translucent powder sets my make up well. The packaging is excellent and it's easy to control how much product you use rather than having a dump everywhere when you try to get just a little bit. Added bonus is this brand is paraben and and cruelty free",2
"this is my new favorite blush! I purchased the milk cheek and lip stick Andre months ago and fell on love with  the cream formulation for blushes,  I have always used powders.  this Bounce Blush is my second blush THAT isn't powder and I LOVE IT SO MUCH.  I purchased it in the color ""be my first kiss"" which,  to me,  as a bit of am orange like tone to it? o don't know,  I'm terrible at describing colors but it looks amazing with my skin tone. I'm very pale and warmer colors usually look better on it.  \n\nit's a very smooth  whipped cream, not to heavy or thick at all.  but not watery either.  when you apply it you need very very little and you get this perfect glowing look.  I'm telling you,  it's just like the product description says.  it's also buildable so if you want a deeper color you can,  which I also love. it's not the strongest pop of color like some blushes I have,  more natural. but I think it's perfect and while I just received it today it did stay on perfectly for the 5-6 hours I wore it.  the only thing I put over it was bare minerals finishing powder and I had nothing underneath. I'm not sure how if would do with other products though and I also want to say that I have oily skin. it doesn't have an oily look or shine to it and I did not notice it making my skin more oily threw the day so flags good too.  if you're on the fence just do it,  you'll love it.  and don't be fooled by the small jar,  a little goes a long way.",1
"This is my new favorite go-to palette. The colors are neutral enough to go with anything, with just the right amount of shimmery shades and mattes  They all blend beautifully, the formula lasts all day, and the shades work for a natural day look or a glam night look. It's also the perfect size to throw in your bag, packaging is super cute, and the smell is so yummy.  Plus, it's a good bargain, so grab it while you can, you won't be sorry!",3
"This is my new favorite. It's a little tacky after applying,  which I like. I'm over 40 so my eyelids require a little more creativity. The first time I applied this the tackiness seemed to be an issue but i solved that with a light dusting of powder and then applied eyeshadow and it stays on all day and looks great. I've tried a lot of primers and this is really great for such a new product.",3
"This is my new favorite neutral eyeshadow.  I wear it to work almost every day.  it's very subtle but really brightens my eyes. it doesn't look pink with my skin tone, just a shiny version of my natural eyelids.",4
"This is my new favorite sunscreen! I've been looking for a sunscreen for a while that doesn't feel oily or make you feel like you need to shower right after you put it on. This soaks right in to your skin and you can't feel it at all. Overall, I love the feel and would buy this again for everyday use.",0
This is my new holy grail foundation!! the shade is a PERFECT match and does not oxidize on me. I have been wearing it every single day. Its glowy but yet long wearing and never breaks up on me! I did receive this complimentary from Dior and Influenster to test BUT I have never tried a more beautiful formula! 10 stars...get a sample to try then buy u wont regret it!! oh and by the way...No flashback,4
"This is my second jar of this product, and I was so disappointed to find that they changed the packaging! It used to have a pump, but now it's just a tub of product. It still works, but it is less hygienic. Also, they changed the formula and now it smells like play-doh. The product itself is soothing and helps with my red skin, but I took off one star for the packaging and scent.",1
This is my third jar of this primer and I seriously cannot get enough! I have large pores on my chin and T zone and this makes it look so smooth all day and night. I have dry skin and this works so well for my skin. If you're on the fence and need something to fill in your pores and make you look flawless give this a try!,0
"This is my third mini obsessions palette and the third that I've been completely impressed with. I was worried the colours would be too light but on my pale skin they're beautiful. the mattes are just as pigmented and pretty as the shimmers. I'm travelling soon and I will definitely be bringing this with me, it will fit great in my suitcase.",2
"This is not a good toner. Ingredients are not good at all even if its a Clean product. One of the first is alcohol denat wich is very drying and bad for sensitive and acne prone skin. The perfuming of this is intense and again not good for acne or sensitive skin (alot of essentials oils wich is natural but as bad as perfume). On top of that, there is allergen (Limonene,Citronellol e.c.t) that can cause bad skin reaction and should be in no skincare. There is better options in Sephora right now...",0
This is not a hydrating foundation for me. I prepped my skin and this still clung to every dry patch and made my pores look terrible. It also wore poorly. It came off of my nose after 5 hours and the rest of my face looked patchy. I am very disappointed.,3
"This is not a waterproof mascara. it smeared under my eyes and was very difficult to remove. By far one of the worst ""waterproof"" mascaras I have ever bought. I give it a 1 star because it functioned as a mascara and that's it.",4
This is not full coverage just saying. So no one should expect it to fully cover up their face. I Like it because of this. It's pretty liquidy and It's subtle enough not be noticeable that I have foundation on but it also covers up what it needs to. I'm a person with freckles and I really do love them so I try not to cover them up and this is enough to cover up some redness but not fully cover up my freckles. Plus it looks natural if you use the right primer. But I also would want to try out other foundations out there instead of buying this again for 50$ .,0
This is not really a highliter as much as it is a setting powder it is not really a traditional highlighter and i think that's why people dont like it as much. Theyre not using it right. To me its a glowy setting powder or natural highlight at best. I use this to set my entire face lightly especially under the eyes and is the only powder that doesn't give me crepey dry under eye look after setting with powder( i have dry skin). This sets my makeup and gives me the most beautiful glow. I thought for a long time I just couldn't use powder at all to set my makeup because i have dry skin but this is my saving grace. When I use it people ask me what my skin care routine is it gives a lit from within glow. Super thin finley milled powder. I love it!,4
"This is now my daily cleanser. I use this as my second step in a double cleanse and with my Foreo Luna device. In less than a month, my face has gotten noticeably softer and has less congestion. I have combination and very sensitive skin that can feel dry and stripped after washing, but this feels very comfortable and hydrated.\n\nNote: about once a week, I feel that this cleanser is too gentle/not effective enough, and I use a 'harsher' one instead (Neutrogena Gentle Cleanser).",0
"This isn't my favorite Nails Inc set but it is a solid choice if you really like black.  The black took 2-3 coats and was on the thinner side. The  pink took 3-4 coats and was definitely less opaque than the black.  I'm used to Nails Inc taking about 2 coats and these seemed to need more. I experienced some chipping with both colors after 2 days.  I don't see this being an everyday type of polish. However, they would be gorgeous with a little black dress or for a New Year's Eve party.",1
"This isn't really a serum (this product is thicker, but not as thick as a regular Sunscreen), but it soaks right into the skin. It has a good amount of SPF in it and works well under my makeup. My only complaint is that this isn't a product I recommend to poeple if they sweat often, because you'll sweat the white sunscreen right out and it could ruin your makeup.",4
This isn't the miracle worker I expected based on social media reviews. It's good. I have. o real complaints but I've used better. I'll definitely keep thos around and get great use out of it. ut probably won't repurchase. I gave the two smaller ones to my kids. they have the same opinion of it that I do.,2
"This is okay after some practice, for an understated look. That said, the same or better can be achieved with a drugstore mascara for less than half the price. Don't take my word for it. Compare the 0.118 oz in this product with other full size mascaras out there. Would not recommend.",2
"This is one of my absolute favorite palettes, and I have alot! This was however my first Melt purchase. I got this along with Gemini, this is the one I fell in love with! I haven't used the mattes much but my o my those shimmers are absolutely stunning! I do use them with glitter glue because I want maximum pay off, there are so many shifts and different sparkles in a few of these shimmers (blue, gold)that I  have never seen before its absolutely gorgeous. So if you like bold colors & want to stand out this is a must have!",2
"This is one of my favorite foundations and has been on my list of top foundations from the very beginning! it melts into the skin and is full coverage for my skin type (oily, minimal skin blemishes, acne prone).",4
"This is one of my favorite products this year.  I am an essence fanatic.  I tried SK-II and thought, well that was a waste of money and haven't tried an essence in about 10 years.  Now this. It is a retinol product that soaks in and makes my skin soft rather than irritated.  I follow up with a HA serum and then an oil.  I now have skin like the first woman Eve tempting Adam with an apple.",2
"This is one of my favorite serums. I’m on my second bottle and will order again. Each morning in my hand, I mix two drops of this with Buffet and squalene oil and apply to my face. I love the way it feels and I can tell a difference in my skin texture.",1
"this is one of my favorite sprays, it works great when it comes to long lasting. it's just if I'm having a crappy day and I'm very active I'll sweat and some of the makeup sweats off as well.. I still say 4 out of 5 because I'm not as sweaty as I normally am when I use this",1
This is one of my must have skin care products. Although It's pricy it lasts a long time. I love how it makes the dead skin gently ball up. It makes my skin feel incredibly soft. After using it my products absorb better and I won't have to use as much of them so it saves me money.,2
"This is one of the best buys that you can make at sephora right now, because of the sale and all of the quality products that you get for $34! I loved all of the mascaras but the ysl mascara was clumpy and weighed my lashes down, even after curling them with a eyelash curler. Luckily, the ysl mascara is a small sample size and so it wasn't that big of a loss. Overall, it was such a great buy that I bought a second set!",1
"This is one of the best foundations I've tried in some time.  I was going to purchase the Bobbie Brown prime and prep moisturizer, however I saw this foundation included as a full sized duo set for a great price and decided to try.  \nI've always liked Bobbie Brown's foundation line because of the wide range of colors for every skin tone and undertone.  However many brands now  have full ranges of foundation colors and I have grown to like some. But this foundation really takes the cake! Finish is natural, not too matte nor shiny or luminous. Lasts all day and doesn't enlarge pores or seep into lines. This looks  GREAT with the BB prime & prep which I use for colder and drier weather, but still looks fab with my other primers.  Will definitely repurchase.",4
"This is one of the best sets I've purchased. The gloss is creamy and has a cooling minty effect that really lasts on the lips for hours. The shade is the perfect neutral nude tone. The finishing powder although deluxe sized is not to small, I never go through eye products fast enough before they expire and for that reason the size is just right.",0
"This is one of the better eye creams I've tried.  It goes on smoothly around my undereyes (which have fine lines) and isn't greasy so it sits very well under makeup.  However, for its price, I don't find that it does much more than a primer.  I did not see much in terms of improvement to my undereyes following a few months of use.",1
"This is one of the four products I use daily. I'm not big into makeup, especially things like foundation.\n\nI have oily and sensitive skin. It is easily irritated but if I use the right products it stays clear.\n\nI love using this product on it's own to reduce the oil on my face and lightly blur imperfections.",0
"This is one of the most beautiful firming serum I have ever tried. I will be honest I had given up on firming products because I thought they didn't work until this. The serum has an earthy fragrance that dissapears quickly and is not bothersome, it is not sticky and absorbs beautiful. I can use this morning and night. I did stop my regular routine to see the best results. I had no breakouts or irritation. The results are plump , firm skin . The pressure point is a plus as well. I noticed my eyes looked lifted as well. I'm 42 and couldn't be happier with this product. I will purchase after this bottle. I've seen a few reviews about the pump and the two different serums not coming out evenly but if you told it over the palm of your hand it's equal. I took off one star because of the hefty price tag but it's so worth it for youthful skin and it also brightens, smooths and leaves your skin softer than ever.",2
This is one of the worst if not the worst eye makeup remover . It does remove my eye makeup but irritated my eyes so bad if I lived closer to a Sephora I would return it as it is I am throwing it away .,3
"This is only meant to be used on tans ""at least three days old"". I bought this thinking I could use it to fix spots and areas that got too dark during application. I was wrong and had to call in sick today because I accidentally fell asleep with IOP tanner on. When I woke up I thought, oh well I have the eraser to remove it; only it didn't removed it at all!!! A lot of money for something to remove an ""old"" tan. I'm now stuck with an orange face for at least three days??! :*(",1
"This is perfect for those who may be intimidated by lipstick.  I have tiny lips and look ridiculous in full pigment lipstick.  But sometimes I want something a bit more girly and luxurious than a tinted lip balm. This suits the bill,  perfectly.  It's not too shiny,  it has decent staying power for what it is, the packaging it's adorable and substantial, and the color (203) is visible without being overpowering.  I will be purchasing another color.",4
"This is perfect. Keeps the Beauty Blender protected and allows it to dry without it being completely exposed. I wish people would read the instructions that this came with. It's on the bottom of the plastic case that it came in. It states that it CAN HOLD TWO BEAUTY BLENDERS AT ONCE, that's why it's large.  It's worth the money!!",4
"This is probably my favorite lipstick of all time.  It comes beautifully packaged, in the stylish gold tube embossed with color coordinated hearts.  \n The smell is fresh and lightly fruity.  It goes on like a dream, creamy but not overwhelming.  And the color is gorgeous for me; a bright fruit punch-coral combo.  Love it!",3
This is probably one of the least favorite mascaras I own. I jumped on the early early trial and was excited when it arrived. Glad I didn't pay for this because it was a huge disappointment. \n\nThe wand is too big and does not get all the smaller lashes. It is clumpy and thick. After a few hours I had raccoon eyes. Very disappointed.,3
"This is probably the best clean liquid eyeliner of tried, but it doesn't perform as a $37 eyeliner should.  What's most frustrating about it is that the liquid doesn't dispense well or smoothly, which is probably because of the felt tip-- I've found this to be common with felt tips. It produces rough edged lines and it's also difficult to get an opaque line, even if you use primer and go over the line repeatedly. Although the eyeliner is pretty good with not smudging, it does flake and has flaked into my eyes, a lot.",2
"This is probably the worst mask I have ever used. I tried a thin layer and it just wouldn't peel off. I needed to wash it off. The next time I tried it, I applied a slightly thicker layer. It never entirely dried. What a waste of money. It went right into the garbage.",3
"This is seriously the most beautiful pallet I've ever set eyes on. Im completely obsessed with it. The colors are so deep and rich, yet completely blendable. The color payoff is insane! Yes it is a bit pricey (I mean did you see the packaging??), but the pans are pretty large and the colors are so versatile. I'm tempted to buy another when its back in stock, I don't think I can live without this palette now. If you get the chance to have this palette in your life TAKE IT!!",4
"THIS IS SO BOMB! Best brow enhancer. I love this and it looks so good on the brow. It gives me a natural lift and brightness to my brow bone. So sad to see Sephora doesn't see the importance of continuing of the ""spice"" color. It works great for darker women. The lighter ones only work on very light or white women.",1
"This is such a beautiful color in a moisturizing formula! I really love the color of the original pillow talk lipstick but the formula is a bit dry for me. This color is slightly darker than the original but looks beautiful still. I definitely wish the packaging was larger and there was more product, like other reviewers say as well.",1
"This is such a beautiful eye shadow that is almost effortless to apply, for someone new to eye shadows or had problems with other products you may find this shadow stick helpful and the added bonus is no crease problem and stays on till you take it off.",4
"This is such a flattering palette! Every color is just so pleasing!   These are seriously, by far, some of the most buttery mattes I have ever used from any brand or any palette!  They REALLY nailed the formulation on this palette.  I adore the outside with the red-orange, uneven raised, reflective palette.  I love the ""click"" the palette makes when it's securely shut (I would trust this in my purse or travel).  I adore the colors in here.  The color story is beautifully told and every color here belongs in here.  This is far better than ABH palettes and this should really be your staple, go to, palette. You cannot go wrong with this color story.  The shimmers are so beautiful on the eye and it all blends like a dream while shining bright with shimmers/glitters).  If you're going to be picking up any staple soon, this one should be it.  The quality is there, the pay off is amazing, and the story is complete.",0
"This is such a great product, I'm shocked I didn't try it sooner because I love Bareminerals.  This is my first stick foundation and I usually go for radiant finish foundation, but this does impart a beautiful glow and looks so natural.  So easy to use and great for travel.  Amazing- I had to keep checking my face out with this on!!  So much better than a much more expensive brand that I had to return.  I've never had bad luck with bareminerals and although I love buying make up and own nearly every product on the market, I can confidently say that this is the best brand of products out there.  Consistently spectacular.",2
"This is such a great tiny palette. The formula is astounding to the point that the blend is amazing, it actually makes you want to wear bright colors. I'm not sure how long the palettes will last for, but definitely get it when you can. It's worth the investment for the quality.",1
"This is such a hidden gem. I had a very specific color in mind when I walked into Sephora. I swatched this liner in Violet and it's the most vibrant purple with a hint of blue. There was nothing else at the store that's comparable to this color. It dries down completely in seconds. I used this as an eyeliner and on my waterline for an event and it lasted all day. If you're looking for a vibrant metallic purple, this is it. It's not a thin pencil but I don't find it difficult to apply. You can be precise with this using an eyeliner brush.\nFor what it's worth, it's made in Germany.",0
"This is such a lush & luxury product. It felt good on my skin. It definitely brightened & plumped my undereyes over a couple of nights. My eyes a little dark. \n\nThe little spoon is perfect, you get just the right amount, because it doesn't take very much of the cream for application. \nI wanted to continue to use this product, but after a week & a half but I started to develop milia bumps under my eyes! So it was a little too heavy for me personally.\nI received this product for free to review from Influenster. \nI have passed it onto my mother who also suffers from dark under eyes.",1
"This is such an amazing mask! I use it about 2 times a week, sometimes a third if my skin is breaking out. I'll use it at night after cleansing my face, and by morning my blemishes are noticeably smaller. The tub is pretty big and it has lasted me about three months and I still have a few weeks with in it. Honestly my favorite mask that works consistently. Love it because high end brands like Drunk Elephant irritate my skin, but this mud mask works amazingly.",0
"This is such an amazing set!I have tried the Watermelon mask before and I absolutely love it. it smells like Jolly Ranchers and leaves my skin so soft and supple. \nI've been wanting to try the Pineapple Serum because I've heard great things about it and it didn't disappoint. It helped minimize the appearance of my texture and blemishes so much. If you've been wanting to try out this brand, I recommend purchasing this set. it's got a great value for Amazing products.",2
This is such an amazing value. The mask is AMAZING and the exfoliator/toner is also very nice. The mosturizer isn't the best for me personally because I have oily skin but it smells nice and does feel really good!,3
"This is such a natural and lovely tan. It doesn't transfer and feels nice on the skin. It does feel a little sticky when it is drying down but only for a few minutes and then it goes away and is smooth. I would say this is a little hydrating but not overly so. It takes about 6 to 8 hours to see the full effect but you can start to see results in as little as 4 hours. I also like how you don't need alot of product to cover your entire body and face which means this lasts a fairly long time. I have used this about 6 times so far and it is still over half full (face and entire body, legs arms etc). I would say that this tan lasts for about 4 or 5 days but it fades in a natural way, not splotchy or patchy. I have not had any problems with it staining clothing, sheets or making my skin splotchy, uneven, or patchy. I usually use a tanning Mitt with it and it works wonderfully but I have used my hands before too and the results are the same, I just prefer a Mitt because I don't like staining my palms which I have done before by forgetting to wash my hands afterwards. As long as you wash your hands after it won't stain. This also wear nicely under makeup which i have done before while i waited for it to develop (i had applied it after my morning shower and then did my makeup, it worked just fine)",1
this is such a nice eye cream! Eve lom's products are very nice despite being on the bougie $ide. I use this as a daytime eye cream as it absorbs very well and doesn't leave a greasy film like a lot of eye creams. Great for under concealer use. I do really feel that it helps with my puffyness and dark circles as I haven't felt the need to wear as much concealer,0
"This is super pretty but it might as well be a loose glitter. No matter if I use a glitter primer, brush, swipe or pack it on with my finger, I end up with sparkles all over my face throughout the day and it transfers all over my crease and falls into my lashes. will be returning",0
"This is the best clay mask I have tried! I have dry acne prone skin, so most clay masks just dry my skin out more - this one doesn't, yet I still get all the benefits. The bergamot essential oil and alcohol tingle a bit after applying, but it goes away. It can be a little tricky to get off so I suggest using a damp washcloth. I also like that it is gentle enough for me to use a few times a week when my breakouts are really bad. Overall I really like this mask, but the tube does have a lot of air which is misleading, but the price is right for what you get. I wish the directions were printed on the tube also - I'm not going to keep the box and I don't use it often enough to remember them, so I always have to come to this Sephora page and reread the instructions and see how long to keep it on for.",3
"This is the best cleaner ever!  I've been using this for many years, sometimes I try something new but it's never the same and I always come back to this product. As I said it is the best cleanser ever!!! I will recommend this to everyone.",3
This is the best ever! I kept getting compliments on my skin. I have large pores and this definitely has helped so much with that issue. My skin tone over all looked amazing and skin just felt super clean. I  received the product free or complimentary for sampling purposes that you received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes.,1
"This is the BEST eyebrow gel I've ever used in my entire life! I had the Milk fiber gel and it would just make my eyebrows move around and not make my hairs stay put. I also have the Colourpop brow boss and it also can't take my eyebrows. But this one...oh my, this eyebrow gel is 100% the best!! I have thick and really curled hairs specially at the tail of the brow and this eyebrow gel is able to tame the hairs, keeps them in place all day, even until the next day. I woke up from falling asleep the night before and my eyebrows are intact! How is that even possible!? Also, I was checking to see if I would get the flakes people were talking about and I didn't. I use it with and without an eyebrow pencil and didn't saw any white flakes so it's perfect. I also put the product on my bf eyebrows since he has a lot and I wanted to fluff them a little bit and he was wow by it. In conclusion this is the best eyebrow gel out there, if you're looking to control and tame the hairs, long lasting and maybe a bit of fluffiness, the Benefit brow setter shaping & setting gel has you 100% covered.",0
"This is the best foundation! Plus it has clean ingredients! It applies flawlessly every time, no matter what I have on underneath or what season it is. I put just 4 drops into my fingertips and pat across my face- takes about 15 seconds and I’m done! Really incredible, nothing compares!",1
"This is the best foundation tool I've ever tried. Better than any other brushes and better than a sponge. It can be used in various ways, e.g. stippling or dragging, but lately I've been trying to use up a dry stick foundation and have been getting impeccable results by gently swirling (light pressure, very small swirls) the foundation into my skin.",1
"This is the best hand cream I've tried and I have tried a lot. My hands are really dry (and prone to patches of eczema in the cooler seasons), but it doesn't take much of this hand cream to completely moisturize my hands and soften dry patches of skin. It's not greasy or sticky and absorbs right away. I'm also a big fan of the light, citrusy scent! I have one for my nightstand, I have one for my handbag, and I have one at the office, and I will continue to buy this again and again!",0
"this is the best lipliner i've tried :-)) i bought the colour wifey and because i'm pretty pale i've had a hard time matching a lip liner to my shade of lips, but this one looks perfect! and it lasts for at least 6 hours (if not longer) before i have to touch up the inner corners of my lips (but i feel like i never have to touch up my cupids bow which is insane :-0)",4
"This is the best lip mask on the market, full stop. And I've tried them all. What makes this one stand out is its gel-like texture. Unlike most lip treatments which are petroleum-based and just seem to ""sit"" on your lips, this one has a glossy feel that actually seems to penetrate your lips. My lips are always flaky and dry in the winter, and this mask completely smoothed out my lips after just ONE use. Even when it wore off, my lips felt great without feeling the need to reapply. Also, a little goes a long way. This has become my holy grail lip treatment and hope it never goes away.",2
"This is the best mascara I have ever used, and I have tried them all. I have sensitive eyes, I rub at my face, and I want dramatic lashes. At the same time, I don't enjoy waterproof mascara because it's too hard on my lashes. This is perfect. Paired with the velvet primer, my lashes looked amazing.\n\nI did receive this product complimentary to review, however that does not affect my opinions.",0
This is THE BEST MASCARA I HAVE EVER USED. I have been using this product for the past 7 years and I am always happy with the results.  I have tried other Mascaras but THEY'RE REAL is THE BEST. I definitely recommend this product!!!❤❤❤,3
This is the best of the la Mer creams for me anyway. I have normal-dry skin. I tried the original creme and wanted to love it but it broke me out. The gel cream is nice but a little too light for me. This soft cream is just the nicest. Soooo soft and the perfect hydration. Doesn't break me out. Absorbs quickly. I'm just so pleased with it and am happy Sephora sells it now and am extra happy for the 20% off sales!,4
"this is the best product I have come across. my skin has changed again as I near forty, nothing else soaks into my skin and actually hydrates. everything else I have tried -lancome, khiels, drunk elephant, etc, just leaves my skin greasy. I have also noticed a reduction in redness as well, just a little bit.",2
"This is the best sample box ever! I love everything in it, especially the deluxe size sample of the solid beauty cleaner. That is my fave cleaner now! I bought this sample box a couple weeks ago. Oh my gosh, this is the best cleaner for brushes and sponges! It doesn't hurt that all the other samples are larger sizes which will last for quite a while. Keep putting out great boxes Sephora that we can buy on your site. Love these!",3
"This is the best setting spray I've tried. I've got combo skin, Asian F, 33 y.o. I wear liquid foundation and finish with the hourglass setting powder and this. My face looks dewy and fresh and stays that way for at least 8 hours before I have to touch up. Truth is, I don't even have to touch up, I just get really picky with the coverage on my nose. Get this setting spray so they don't discontinue it lol",2
This is the best thing to happen to my sun spots. Works better than their Vitamin C serum. (I do use both currently though.) One pump goes all the way around my orbital bone and down my cheeks. I put this on before I bother with the Vit C serum. It has really lightened my dark spots and brightened my skin. This should not be an eye cream - they call it that so they can charge you more. This should be a 1oz face cream. Best product in their line in my opinion.,1
This is the blush of my dreams. I have been looking for the perfect coral peachy shade that isn't too matte or too radiant and this fits the bill perfectly. It's perfectly pigmented just right so that its hard to go over board with it but you still get the perfect amount of pigment.  I have a problem with getting a little carried away with my blush and this formula makes it easier for me to get the perfect amount. I love how it doesn't exaggerate or empathize texture or fine lines. It is a very smooth formula. I use a blush brush to apply it. Out of my massive makeup collection i think this particular shade and formula is my favorite.,1
"this is the craziest and most blinding highlighter ever. I'm so happy I got this. none of my other highlighters, regardless of the brand, nothing compares to this. the brush it comes with is also perfect for applying to the cheeks.",0
This is the eye cream I have been searching for!  I have eczema under my eyes and trying to find an eye cream that didn't irritate my sensitive skin or leave my under eyes feeling dry and itchy hours later was impossible.   But this baby works!  It doesn't irritate my eczema and moisturizes it very well.  I work 12 hr shifts and my under eyes still feel soft when I'm done work.  My eczema is even getting better!  This stuff is amazing.  The only critique I have of it is that it can slide from the eye area onto the cheeks but it's definitely worth it.,2
"This is the first adhesive I've used that stayed all night & did not make me eyes itchy or watery.  Super easy to apply. \n\nIt was over 100° when my night started.. after hours of bobbing & dancing in a sweaty auditorium the lashes were still in place. I wasn't even aware of them after awhile (the lashes were super costumey, so I was surprised by that).. thought maybe they'd fallen off, but nope. Securely in place!",4
"This is the first ambient lighting edit face palette that I have ever bought and it is a beautiful palette.  I have light to medium skin tone and all the powders look beautiful on my skin tone, such a beautiful formula. That being said, I do have a few gripes.  The pans are much smaller than I personally expected.  I tend to use larger brushes to set my face and bronzer and it was so hard to just get one powder.  My other gripe is that I have had this palette for maybe 2 weeks now, and already one of the powders has fallen out. I was travelling when it happened and I know that things can get jostled while traveling.  I thought that this would be great to travel with because it has so much in one compact.  However, the powders just don't seem to be pressed in well enough, so I suggest NOT traveling with this.  I think for the price point, it was good but not great.",0
"This is the first beauty product I've ever gotten from Sephora that smelled so badly I thought twice about even putting it on my skin. I considered tossing it multiple times before I eventually decided to try a small amount on the back of my wrist. The smell did seem to fade away quicker than I expected and it blended well into my skin, but I cant imagine putting this on my face. It's clearly an issue with multiple reviewers noting the smell, so not just those of sensitive to fragrance. I tossed the jar as it was a deluxe sample.",2
"This is the first eye primer in a few years that actually works for me. It lasted all day and night, which is a miracle when it comes to my problematic oily/hooded eyes. I use to use the one from urban decay but for some reason it just stopped working for me. after that I tried alot of different brands including too face and smash box with the same horrible creasing transferring fading results. This one lasts with no creasing or transferring. Shadows stay beautiful and put. Highly recommend!",2
"This is the first foundation I have found that the oil on my skin doesn't destroy in less than an hour. I have struggled with this for years and basically quit wearing make up because it was pointless. Love Love this foundation. I took off one star for the scent because I can't stand how it smells, but it does dissipate after it dries down. it just stinks to me.",3
"This is the first foundation that I've found that truly matches my skin and looks so natural. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy like I expected a stick foundation to feel. It wears pretty well although it does break up in areas where you apply heavy powder products like blush and highlighter so I took away one star. Other then that, it's a great wear everyday foundation when you don't feel like looking Instagram Slayed. lol",2
this is the first product from Nails Inc. that I have recieved what seems like used or defective. The stars part was very dry and difficult to put on. I usually buy all my nail polishes from Nails Nd love them. but this one was terrible.,1
This is the first review I have ever written.  My skin recently got irritated and I found out it was peri-oral dermatitis.  I was trying a lot of things to help.  This helped me heal and give me the best skin I've had in years.  Will always incorporate this in my routine. Thanks The Ordinary! And cannot beat the price point!,2
"This is the first time I'm using this mask. I was super excited to try it. I'm not sensitive to fragrances at all. However this mask has a very strong rose scent and it's all I can smell since applying the mask twenty minutes ago. I usually do just fine with strong scents (Peter Thomas Roth Sulfur Mask, Herbivore Blue Tansy Mask, etc) but I am starting to get a headache from this. I will likely have to return this before even seeing if the results because I'm really having a hard time with the potent floral smell. I'm sad because it has really good reviews.",1
"this is the first time I've tried a stick foundation and I've heard good reviews on this product. upon my first application, I noticed that it sat beautifully on my face, my pores are smooth EXCEPT it made my dry patches that I even heavily moisturized show up! some patches I didn't know we're dry pop up too! make sure to exfoliate before using this foundation. other wise, the colour oxidized way darker than the stick itself when on skin so I chose the lightest shade Blanc for perfect match- I usually wear NW10 Mac",0
This is the first time trying this fabulous product and I absolutely loved everything about it.this eyeshadow and colors was very pretty and they blending together very well.the eyeshadow went on smooth with very little flaking and the pigmentation was great and the colors didn’t bleed through and it lasted all day without any streaking.I absolutely love it and definitely recommend this great shadow.,3
"This is the greatest foundation of all time. I am 65 and have tried many, but this one makes my face look flawless and smooth. I tried 2 colors, the first one i bought in the middle of winter, the warm 301 color, and that was good but it has a bit of a rosy undertone. Then I got the olive 321 in the summer, it is a cool color and is far more flattering for my complexion, which is in between warm and cool but leans toward olive.  I use the 321 color all year round. You need to try these on in the store. I can't say enough about this product, I'll be using it forever.",4
"This is the last pair of falsies I ever buy. I have purchased the more expensive brands (because I like un-false looking false eyelashes and clear bands). The whispiest/natural pair is far too false for me and the clear band is so delicate, and the lashes are glued to their tray so much so that you bend them out of shape just to remove them. Save your money and get some other brand.",3
"This is the lip balm I have always been looking for.  It is lightweight & feels wonderful from your first application. It truly does provide 24 hour hydration on the lips. It works well under lipstick, lip gloss, lip stain & by itself. There is no noticable scent or taste. It is not greasy, tacky or sticky. I absolutely love it.",3
"This is the longest lasting lipstick (liquid or bullet) that I have ever worn. I wore it to a wedding in June and I reapplied once after dinner but I didnt really need to, and that was around 7 and I first applied it around noon, and it was still absolutely perfect by midnight. This lipstick is amazing",0
This is the most amazing full coverage foundation! The staying power is perfect! This is the only foundation that don't rub on off my nose because of my oily t-zone. Ingredients are perfect and Cover FX is cruelty free wich i love! Super easy to blend and use. Nice price point for 12g! Alot of cream or stick foundation are in a 7 to 10 g size. Also my skin is VERY acne prone skin and no breakouts at all! I have almost all the full coverage foundation and this one is by FAR the best. I recommend to anyone!,0
"This is the most drying, cakeyist, awful foundation I have ever tried. It dries up so quickly before you can even spread it on your face. Full coverage that feels like a dry, thick mask on. Useless luxury brand at premium cost.  You're better off using a drugstore brand which are so much better.This foundation is a total waste of money and hype. Going back! ZERO stars but you had to click on at least one.",3
"This is the most natural looking bronzer on my light skin and olive undertones. Can't go crazy with it if I tried. It is super natural on the skin and blends like a dream. This shade on me is not really buildable because it's so light but maybe other are. The finish is satin, so not too shimmery and not totally matte",0
"This is the most perfect eye cream, seriously. At least for me. I didn't know what to expect when I first got this product as a free sample but I gave it a try for a few days and then weeks and I started noticing the skin around my eyes was just more hydrated and you could barely notice my crows feet wrinkles around my eyes. I am so excited about this because no other eye cream has done this before. My esthetician even asked me if I had done botox or Hyaluronic Acid in my eye area and no, for the record, I haven't done any of those, just this eye cream. So, I would highly recommend it. It doesn't feel heavy on the eyes like other eye creams and it's just wonderful. Will buy more after I am done with this sample!",0
"This is the most precise angle brush i have. I bought it to use with my dipbrow and its the winning combo for me. I have never been able to make such fine strokes with another brush. an issue ive had with brushes that include a spoolie is the spoolie snapping. This seems very well made , sturdy and not at risk of snapping with normal use. Really couldnt be happier with a brush.",4
this is the nastiest cream i have ever tried in my life! i put it on and the smell was horryfying! it smelled like a wet cloth u left lying in a corner moist and soaking for 2 weeks. like my sponge when it starts to get old and has that nasty moldy dirty time to throw out smell. absolutly horryfying. i tried to leave the product on to see id the smell would go way if it absorbed and after 3min i literally started to get nauseous from this cream and had to wash it off asap! DISGUISTING! i got it in the sephora favorites kit and im disturbed!,1

"This is the only foundation I've tried that doesn't give me a parched, flaking, dusty look by the end of the day. I have dry skin that overproduces oil to compensate. When I decided to get this foundation, I was skeptical; it's skincare...and foundation? I was worried it would be extremely light coverage or splotchy. Instead, I fell in love with it. If you have dry skin, I can't recommend this foundation enough. It feels like a moisturizer and looks so dewy and soft on the skin. My only suggestion is to wear a nice primer underneath to 1: hold it in place, and 2: keep it from melting. It has an argan oil base that moisturizes soooo well. I use the miracle worker primer and i couldn't be happier. my skin is in the process of purging with the clarisonic and it looks great despite the little breakouts I have. I truly love this. \n\nnow, it pulls yellow and doesn't have the greatest shade range, which is a shame. I'd love to suggest this foundation to more people, and I hope to see more shades in future!",0
"This is the only full coverage makeup I have used that doesn’t feel and look heavy. I’m blown away by how well it covers. I’m older with wrinkles, large pores, and oily which is very challenging in regards to foundation but this works! I was very hesitant about the price but a little goes a long way and it makes my life so much easier, it’s worth it. \nMy only disappointment is that it’s a bit too yellow, but that goes with all foundations for me. Im still going to use it, I think it looks good. I will buy again.",3
"This is the only mascara I have used for years. I love the curving brush...I don't use an eyelash curler so this brush gives me that curve I want. Since I can get emotional at the drop of a hat, I always buy the waterproof. The store didn't have it in stock, but they ordered it for me. The price on this mascara can be all over the map for some reason, but this was a good price.",3
"This is the only powder I’ve found that can control shine for me. I have very oily skin, and I’ve seriously tried every lotion, powder, primer or setting spray on the market. If it says it’s matifying, I buy it. I have finally found a combo that works for me, and this is part of it!",0
"This is the perfect contour shade for my skintone! (Perfect Match is Fair in IT Cosmetics CC cream). Typically contour shades this light tend to be orange but this is amazing. It just glides across the skin and blends so well. I've recently started to wear less makeup and focus on skincare, but this has stayed in my daily routine! It's so subtle yet so effective!",0
This is the perfect finishing product for my make-up routine. I use Dr. Jart’s Premium BB balm and then Bare Minerals over it. I then lightly spray this mist for a dewy finish (never oily) that makes my pores disappear.,3
"This is the perfect moisturizer for my dry, sensitive skin.  It moisturizes and soothes and doesn't cause redness or breakouts.  I was using another moisturizer that I've also repurchased but wanted to reduce the number of silicones I'm using on my face to see whether there's any reduction of change of life related hormonal redness, bumps, texture, dullness.  That may be asking too much of a moisturizer  (have noticed a benefit adding a light AHA to the mix).  It sinks easily into the skin, providing a great base for whatever follows.  I will repurchase and explore other items by this line.  Like others, love the packaging.  I only wish I could see how much remains (a window in the jar??).",3
"This is the prefect powder brush. It is soft, fluffy and blends powder like a dream for an airbrushed natural finish. This brush is worth every penny! So happy I purchased. I really like the size of the brush and don’t find it too big As other reviews were suggesting.",1
"This is the second time that Benefit has ""re-branded"" a product with a significantly lower quality product. I LOVED the Hello Flawless powder foundation, and this new version is a cheap knockoff. I have now tried three other brands to replace the Hello Flawless and none of them are sufficient (despite being more expensive). I now look at least 5 years older than I did when using Hello Flawless.  I will never use a Benefit product again given their history on replacing products with degraded knockoffs.",1
"This is the sharpest liquid liner I've ever used. The shape it creates is easy and beautiful. I don't feel that I need to work as hard to make my winged liner look sharp. This eyeliner also does not transfer onto my brow bone which can happen with some liners because of the slight hood in my eye. However, that being said, I do find it quite difficult to take off. Even my farmacy green clean has trouble with it and it flakes off into my lashes. I felt i had to work my eye alot to get it off.",0
"This is the very first luminizer, illuminator etc. that I have liked and doesn't amplify tiny crows feet or other wrinkles.My 1st try with it was OVER makeup and was stunned to suddenly look as though I'd gotten 8  hours of sleep, zero stress and mot a care in the world. SO very glad I purchased this! I will not be without it!!",4
"This is the very first ""radiant"" foundation that I like. Usually, I prefer a natural finish but this finish is just beautiful, healthy looking and youthful.   I'm also very pleased with the SPF which is 35!  I'm wearing shade1.5.  I've had samples and purchased so many foundations trying to find one that doesn't emphasize fine lines or pores and is also in a good color for my very light, neutral skin.  Wow!  I wear this with Tarte Colored Clay undereye correcter.  I'm really happy with that combination and feel good that I persisted until I found a foundation and concealer that make me happy.",2
"This is the worst moisturizer I've tried in a long time, and maybe ever. It's incredibly sticky and sits on top of the skin. After over an hour post-application, my face remained sticky and none of the product seemed to sink in. I literally had to wash it off and apply something else.",1
"this is trash, it is thick&cakey, does not spread. just thick chalky nastiness. and if you put powder on top to try and fix it, its thick mess doesnt mix with anything and flakes off and does not last, within mins I could see my imperfections",0
This is truthfully is one of the best glosses I have tried. I am actually not the biggest fan of glitter glosses but this one is amazing. It reminds me of the fenty gloss bomb but lightweight and not sticky! It has a lovely sweet mint scent and it feels super moisturizing. Even though its a glitter gloss it doesn't feel gritty and it gives you that wet lip look. Also the packaging is stunning with the rose gold features! I highly recommend!,1
"this is very pretty and glittery, if you prefer more nude or neutral looks these highlighters are not for you, if you wanna look like a sparkly pixie princess these ARE FOR YOU!  the pink pairs Beautifully with the sephora blush in datenight!",0
"This is way too expensive for what you get! These bottles are so small! Don't get me wrong, I love sample kits and prefer to order them when I'm curious about a brand or product, but this is...it's a little larger then the palm of my hand! the box that contains both bottles. Returning. There's plenty of stuff I would rather spend $20 on.",4
"This is, without a doubt, the best pore filling primer I have ever used. My huge pores literally disappeared.  I have tried and been disappointed with so many highly rated primers including Benefits POREfessional as they make my aging skin look dull and accentuate my textured skin. I like it equally with or without foundation.  My foundation goes on smoothly and evenly without any pilling.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.",3
"This is wonderful for fading dark spots and evening out the complexion! I use it in the morning underneath my moisturizer, it is a very thin liquid and it absorbs nicely. I am repurchasing this for the 3rd time, because I have never found a product that is so effective and at such a great price. Please never discontinue this, Deciem/The Ordinary!",0
"this is your do it ALL serum! it's so hydrating, brightening and rich in anti-oxidants to prevent aging! I love how it's so lightweight and sits beautifully with makeup! love the ingredients list and I also love how my skin looks so dewy, radiant and helps fade pigmentation and it actually helped my eczema induced sensitivity! IN LOVE! \n\nI also saw how my pigmentation is slowly fading away!",0
"This just didn't work for me. I used almost the whole bottle because I just kept telling myself it just needs one more week. I would use as part of my skincare routine every time I washed my face, so 2-3 times a day. The  only difference i noticed was that my skin was more moisturized.  My skin texture was the same and my skin wasnt evened out. I saw better results with my face oils. Three stars for making my skin feel super moisturized.",1
"This just isn't for me. It creased around fine lines, and was super heavy. Also doesn't perform too well over time, and makes any blemishes stand out. Just a note, I used it with a brush, so using a sponge might get completely different results, which is why I'm putting two stars. But generally not for me.",4
"This leaves a sticky residue on the skin. It does not soak in. Beyond that, it gave me a horrible burning, itching rash! Be careful. I dont even have sensitive skin. If i could give this no stars I would. Also, it smells like buttered popcorn. Thank god it was only a small sample size from the Play! box.",4
"This leaves my skin feeling so soft! I have oily skin and it’s not tightening at all, my face just feels clean. I used to use the Fresh rose face wash, but $ to ounce this is a better price and my skin feels a little more moisturized and soft than with the Fresh one. The scent is also great! It smells very lightly like green juice, which is refreshing in the morning. I love the glass packaging and I’ve just bought my second bottle",0
"This liner is beautiful. I love the color and the packaging. I love how you can click to dispense more product. I wear it with She's Unapologetic lippie and top with She's Expensive gloss. Lol, it's funny all 3 words also describe me. ;-) I took a star off for the price. For a liner, it needs to go down to around $20-$22 instead. I only bought it because of the VIB Rouge sale. Possible I'll repurchase but I have KKW liners which are bomb and cheaper.",3
"this lip kit is super versatile it has the perfect universal nudes, what I did with mine I applied them as is and also layered them to create a unique look, but what I love the most is the formula, it Does NOT dry my lips!! yay! it has a sticky but smooth consistency when applying but within 30 seconds it settles and no longer sticky, the color stays on great very pigmented, my go to in the color 'on mute' but I also love layering it with 'summer haze', this is definitely a gift that everyone can use!",0
"This Lip Matte is wonderful, the shade is beautiful, it leaves my lips moistened and plumped! It lasts almost all day i usually just have to re apply one time out of the whole day! It also smells wonderful! Perfect for the Holiday Season!",4
"This lip oil is soft and pretty and delivers a subtle glossy look.  It doesn't feather or bleed, leaves a natural flushed color when most of it has worn off.  And, it's not sticky.  However, I find the overly large applicator a little difficult to use.  Applicator would be perfect if it was just a bit slimmer, but not overly slim like most other gloss/liquid lipstick applicators.  Also, would like to see a muted rose color.  The berry wine is pretty, but it's not pinkish rosy.",3
This lip pencil does not dry my lips at all and I have very dry lips. I use it either with a lipstick or by itself (if it's the #32--sadly now out of stock) as it is close to my natural lip color. I also have the #34 and #80(vibrant red). It helps my lipstick last longer.,4
this lipstick is everything.  super smooth texture even though it's a matte formulation.  looks great on and doesn't settle in lines.  loving the color and it's also really long lasting.  definitely worth the price.,1
"This lipstick is fantastic! Even though it's highly pigmented it applies nicely and the color is beautiful. I wore it to work (fairly conservative environment) and received compliments on the color. And, of course, the container is gorgeous! The only reason it's not 5 stars is that I had to reapply often. But I do highly recommend it!",2
"This lipstick is great. It stays on when I take a drink. I don't have to reapply throughout the day. It doesn't have any fragrance, but also doesn't have that overwhelming crayon smell that some lipsticks have.",0
This lipstick lasted through eating fried mushrooms and a fried pierogie stromboli. I am absolutely impressed. but I do wish there were matte options... theres alot of sheer options which from what I tested in store are really greasy and not my type... but the matte formula is very impressive in my opinion. I'd highly recommend and I plan on getting more matte colors.,0
"this liquid highlighter is gorgeous. the ingredients are lovely and this feels so effortless. it layers really well and it looks great all on its own. i don't usually gravitate towards this shade in a highlighter but i'm impressed with how it works. full disclosure, i did receive this product for free but i'm sure i'll end up repurchasing.",0
this little baby is so surprising! It is absolutely gorgeous on the skin. It lasts all day and makes you feel so pretty. I keep getting compliments on how dewy and healthy my skin looks! Hope this company makes more products. Just beautiful.,1
"This loose powder is absolutely gorgeous!!! I bought it today and tried it in my arms and it is the most beautiful color with shimmer! This is a must have! I can't wait to try it on my cheeks bones! BEAUTIFUL! Thank you Becca! xo, Becca B",4
"This mascara  gave me beautiful, full defined butterfly lashes but it flaked and smudged so bad on me after only one round. Even on a day I did nothing, it somehow got all over my eyelid, my under eyes, it flaked on my cheeks, it just got everywhere. It looks nice when you first put it on but that's about it. This is one fetish to keep out of the bedroom unless your partner got a thing for pandas.",0
"This mascara gives bautiful and full lashes!!  It gets even better after using a few times.   I've only used Nars foundation / blushes / bruises, and now can say their mascara falls in line with all the greats they offer!  (I tried this as part of Sephora Favorites Lash Stash).",1
this mascara goes really with the Marc Jacobs Primer. I like when mascara adds volume to the lashes (some people prefer lengthening mascaras).\nThis definitely adds volume and its not flakey or crusty\nI received this as a complimentary product via Influenster,0
This mascara has been a lifesaver. The price is great as well as it's wearability. I have oily skin and this mascara stays on. Also I'm a crier so it can withstand some tears shed without making me look like Marilyn Manson.,4
"This mascara is amazing! I love dramatic lashes, & this definitely delivers. Gave me big, bold, fluttery, jet black lashes. They looked amazing. And my lashes were very soft. Did not smudge or flake. This is a top notch formula. I definitely recommend",4
"This mascara is a wet formula, it goes on nicely and my lashes looked fantastic, long and voluminous. The down side is that it does not last all day, after just a couple of hours I start to get black around my eyes and I'm not a fan of the raccoon eye look. I don't dislike enough to return it but I will not buy again.",2
"This mascara is great, I like it because it does not clump up or smudge after a long wear. It also doesn’t irritate my eyes which I usually have ready eyes after I’ve had my make up on for longer hours. I don’t often wear makeup but this mascara is part of my glam up products. I received the mascara free for testing.",1
"This mascara is lengthening and provides volume to your lashes and is smudge proof, which I love; however, I have to knock off a star due to the fact that it is a bit clumpy. Once I separated my lashes and cleaned them up a bit, they looked great, but having to do this might not really be worth the effort when there are other great mascaras out there (",0
"This mascara is not for me and here is why. First off it's very very flaky. I get home from my day and it's all flaked underneath my eyes. Second, I'm not a fan of the brush. It's not tapered or round at the end which makes it hard to reach inner lashes. I do feel like it adds length to my lashes but nothing significant. Definitely don't recommend if you're looking for volume.",2
"This mascara is really black, and really wet which I like, you really have to be careful putting it on can clump. BUT LONG LASHES GLORE AND VOLUME IS AWESOME. does not flake or smudge. it is  real light formula. I look like I have falsies on, but I don't. will repurchase once my travel size I bought runs dry. makes bottom lashes really long as well.",3
"This mascara is the WORST I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot. the brush is super awkward no matter how well you follow the directions. there is a heaping amount of product that comes out. this immediately makes your lashes clumpy, but a sticky sort of clumpy. you might as well buy hair gel and comb it on your lashes, because that's how sticky  my lashes got. it was also impossible to get off even with waterproof Make up remover.  a horrific nightmare.",1
"This mascara makes my eyelashes look amazing, long and thick. Waterproof: It lasts forever without rubbing off. However it lasts almost toooo long, my eye makeup remover couldn’t even take it off. \n\nI received this product as a free sample.",0
This mascara must perform different for everyone because of some of the negative reviews...however it is truly Amazing. I have tried so many different mascaras and this one by far makes my eyelashes look so full and absolutely magical. No issues with smudging or taking off. A bonus- it doesn't irritate my eyes! love it,4
"This mascara was a flop for me. I have really long natural eyelashes that are straight as a board. Even with an eyelash curler, this mascara made them fall down instantly. It had a weird smell to it as well. It was quite flakey and clumpy in some spots. Really not happy with it.",4
"This mascara was pretty good, it didn't run and didn't smudge easily. The brush texture was awful though, it kind of hurts if it touches your eye on accident. The mini size lasted around 4 months of daily use.",0
"This mask broke me out after just one use!!! I woke up in morning with white zits all over my face!!!! Terrible!!! Plus this mask doesn't smell good at all! It supposed to make you look fresh after just one use. Instead, it makes me look terrible. Will never buy again!!",4
"This mask has been great for moisturizing my dry skin in the winter, especially as I incorporate retinol into my routine. I don't know if I would really call it ""healing"", but it is moisturizing and moderately brightening. It has lemongrass essential oil which I can definitely smell the whole time I wear it, but it doesn't bother my skin even though essential oils tend to. The tube is a bit misleading because it's only about half full, but at least the price is right for what you get. I haven't had any issues with it staining anything, but I have been careful about it.",3
This mask is amazing! It definitely delivers hydration and is very gentle. I leave it on over night and sometimes leave it on under makeup throughout the day if I'm extra dry. My skin is very dry andsuper sensitive but this has been my winter holy grail.,4
"This mask is awesome! Its easy to put on-has protective sheets that are obvious so you're not guessing. And even easier to take off. I did have some mud residue but absolutely no scrubbing is needed. it does have a scent but I found it pleasant enough. Didnt break out my oily, acne prone skin. I have already repurchased. Dont want to be without for when I'm feeling lazy!",2
"This mask is so good, and the perfect pick-me-up for tired skin. I had surgery last week and ever since I've been getting no sleep, and I've been too tired to do my regular skincare routine... as you can imagine, my skin was looking pretty rough as a result. I received this mask from Influenster, and honestly after 2 uses my skin is right back to normal, if not better! My eye bags are gone, my colour is back, and I have the nicest, dewiest glow happening. I'm SO happy with how well this mask works. Also, I adore the pump bottle; I'm so used to masks in tubs or squeeze bottles, and they're always so messy. The pump on this totally eliminates mess. Overall, I think this product is fantastic, especially if your skin is looking a little dull. I received this product free for testing purposes.",0
"This mask is very thin, has a lot of serum on it and even had some left in the package as well. The fit was a bit big for me and I needed to make minor adjustments to the eye area. I couldn’t really detect a scent and it stayed in place the whole time it was on, which was a tad longer than recommended. I had a good amount of product left on my skin that felt slightly tacky; it took a little while to absorb. My dry sensitive skin did look more hydrated, brighter and felt softer. It was an ok mask, nothing memorable though.",1
"This mask was horrible, it smelled like a actually Elmer's glue, took an hour to dry and didn't even remove any blackheads it just left my skin too dry and very sensitive. I do not recommend at all plus it's way too pink for this world.",0
"This mask was soaked with product and even had a fair amount left in the package. It’s a thin material that adhered well to my face and overall had a great fit. The serum is clear, watery and fruity smelling. Since the mask was still wet after the recommended time had passed, I decided to leave it on for longer. Once removed my dry sensitive skin felt soft, not tacky, it was more radiant and bit more hydrated. I’d probably buy this one again.",1
"This matches and blends my skin just great.  And, it's light, natural looking and doesn't cause any pore clogs or break outs.  I'm fortunate to have good skin.  But, if you need more of a heavier cover-up makeup, I wouldn't recommend this because it's a thinner spread on your skin.",3
"This matte primer is thick and slightly grainy at first. I have to pat this primer in gently with my fingertips otherwise it goes on too thick and can't be blended out easily. The scent is light and not over-powering, but I would think twice before buying a full-size bottle. The matte effect on my T-zone only lasts if I'm in an office all day and not outside. People without an oily T-zone may find this product more long-wearing.",2
"This may be the best primer I have ever tried.     It blurs pores, lightly mattifies, and has just the right amount of grip.  It's also the only primer I've found other than their own that works (maybe even better) with Fenty foundation.  I like to wardrobe my foundations and this enhances anything I pair it with.  I also love the light fruity scent--it smells like a Starburst.",4
"this may seem like I'm exaggerating, but this is seriously the BEST lip gloss I have ever owned!! it is extremely pigmented for a lip gloss, but doesnt stain your lips which I LOVE! it also stays on your lips. I love these so much!! I have 3 of these and I'm on the way to buy them in every color!",1
"This might be made of magic baby unicorn tears as far as I know. I had a Sephora MA use one of these on me and I couldn't believe it. ...like, actually couldn't believe it - assumed they were using a technique I didn't know about. I left with one in a box, and idk how it works, but it REALLY does. I have been on a ~33 year search to have longer, curled lashes and I've tried a lot. Almost nothing but a warm lash curler held in me for a looong time and then waterproof mascara will make my super straight, downward dog lashes hold a curl. This curler really helps, AND it must fit the shape of my somewhat hooded, almond eye just right because I've NEVER been pinched. That's something! Also, it finds lashes on the sides of each eye I didn't know were there and fans them out as well. Magic!",3
"This might be my Holy Grail acne treatment. I've used other Sunday Riley products before and never really been impressed, but for a couple of weeks I had a breakout and my Kate Somerville standbys and similar products were not helping. Mostly just drying my skin. They usually work for me, but perhaps because the weather has changed to colder and dryer, it just wasn't working. But I had a sample of A  and I was desperate for these cystic and white heads to GO AWAY and I tried the sample. The acne was reduced by half in about two days, and barely noticeable after five days. Gone for good and looks like they'd never been there after eight or nine days. Amazing.",0
"This mini set is adorable. I was skeptical due to the reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I always moisturize my lips prior to any matte or satin lip color. The dark vampy burgundy color went on smoothly and evenly. The white color was beautiful!!! My only disappointment is that the white lippie isn't the easiest to clean the color you just ombre'd off. I had to keep wiping the  color I was lightening off, but it white...so I expected a bit of that. I've also used the white with other matte brands and colors..",2
"this miracle eye wand is truly a miracle! I use the eye cream side of the pen first and dab on with my ring finger and then go in with the brightening/concealing side of the pen. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TARTE SHAPE TAPE FULL COVERAGE MATTE CONCEALER, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU! SO DON'T BUY IT THINKING THAT IT'S SPACKLE FOR YOUR UNDER EYE AND THEN COMING ON HERE AND RATING IT LOW BECAUSE YOUUU DIDN'T RESEARCH PROPERLY. this is a beautiful sheer coverage. I love using my becca under eye brightening corrector, and the using this on top! I wear it every day. because of the eye cream side, this causes the concealer to not crease. PERFECT for mature eyes or people with lines and wrinkles under their eyes.",4
"This mist is rich in antioxidants, amino acids, and Vitamin B5, all of which hydrate, smoothen, and nourish your skin to help achieve its ultimate glow! What I love most is the blue light protection it gives, with the help of the Marigold Flower Extract. Of course, this is a claim one can't personally test out and report results for, but after doing some research of my own, Marigold flowers contain lutein, and lutein helps protect the body (skin, eyes, etc) from UV rays, including the blue light emitted from our cellphones and laptops! Pretty neat if you ask me!\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIt does need a bit of shaking prior to spraying onto the skin, and surprisingly despite the safflower and sunflower oils, this didn't leave my already naturally greasy skin any more oily! So to all my fellow oily skin peeps out there, you're good to use this! I would keep the sprays to just the right amount needed though, not too heavy handed esp if you're part of the oily skin club.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThis has a very natural, grassy kind of scent to me. Not the most pleasant or something you'd want out of a mist, but not horrible by any means! Just know, it doesn't smell like fresh flowers or anything, which might be great for those who hate artificial scents!\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nOverall, another Volition Beauty winner in my book. Highly recommend for those who want the extra UV ray protection, antioxidant and amino acid boost, and glowing skin! \n\n*gifted sample for review, but all opinions are my own and very honest!",0
"this mist is so good. I use it as a toner. I have very sensitive skin and removing my makeup can irritate my skin.  when i spray this on my face it calms my skin and makes it look better.  If you have problems with irritation you're going to love it. I received this for testing purposes,  and I'm so glad I did.",1
"this moisturizer have my face a nice glow and felt like it moisturizer will but it is just way too sticky feeling. it doesn't seem to sink in and feels like it just sits in top. it also found that everytime i used it, by the end of the day i would have very clogged pores. definitely did not work for me.",2
"This moisturizer is a God send for me. I was using some other products and received a sample of this and fell in live with the light weight feel. I put it on and feel like my face and pores can still breath even with makeup. I live that it is clean and I have purchased the full size and use it each and every night. Seriously lightweight but does a wonderful job.\n\nI have sensitive skin, many things irratated it plus I suffer from Roseca and Sweets Syndrome with a Lupus Mylar Rash constantly and this moisturizer is seriously one of the greatest things I ever received in one of my month subscriptions when I had them, I no longer do just too many samples.",3
"This moisturizer is beautiful. As someone with dehydrated, acne-prone combo skin, it's really tough to find a product that effectively hydrates without being too much. And it's near impossible to find gel texture moisturizers that don't immediately disappear on the skin. The lactic acid gives a nice glow to the skin and the skin definitely looks plumed. I personally have grown to enjoy the scent, although it is definitely strong, so I would advise testing in store before purchasing if you are sensitive to scents.",0
"This moisturizer is great. It's lightweight and effective. Apparently, my skin wanted the squalane. The other products I used previously were too harsh. This product has made a huge difference in my skin's appearance. I love it so much, I started using the other products in the line.",3
"This moisturizer is just ok. If you have dry skin it won't be enough, especially in winter. I have combo skin and its not hydrating enough for winter. The plus side is that it's fragrance free and doesn't leave a film on the skin",2
"This moisturizer is literally a miracle. my skin is so oily i have to blot it multiple times a day, and my pores are usually noticeable. With this moisturizer, i go ALL day without blotting my skin even once, and my pores are so tiny that my face looks porcelain and smooth. I have never loved my skin so much since using this moisterizer. SO happy i found this product!!!",1
"This moisturizer is unbelieveable. I am completely shook as to what it has done for my skin. I have acne prone skin, and like that it is non-comedogenic. I haven't had a single breakout since using this cream. The consistency is very light and watery so I was thinking it wouldn't be very moisturizing, but my skin feels so soft and hydrated. I've been receiving a ton of compliments on my complexion, and this is the only thing I have recently introduced. \nThis cream is making me glow!! My skin used to look very dull and this has brightened and softened my skin. \nThis is a holy grail product and now one I cannot live without!!!",4
"This my cream was really nice for my normal to dry skin.  I'd say the only difference between this gel cream and the other dr Jart cream, was that this is much thinner and lighter so I use it under my make up. It makes me face feel very plump. I recieved this in my VoxBox from Influenster.",0
"This my favorite cleanser, out of any I've tried,  I have Pharmacy's balm sitting mostly unused on my counter because I prefer this oil. However, I do not like that the SIZE has changed to be 1/3 smaller than it was previously - it was 150ml, now it is 100ml. The picture still reflects the old product. It feels dinky in your hand. I don't remember what what the price was before...hopefully that has gone down significantly or I will have to rethink that balm cleanser.",3
This needs tweaking...the intensity and longevity is great. It goes on precise and clean. However the felt tip seems to dry out by the time you get to the second eye! Perhaps switch to bristles or have a button that allows one to re-wet the applicator?,2
This night cream is amazing! So hydrating and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks amazing! I will be repurchasing again and again. I even bought the gift set and gifted the amazingness to my mom!,0
"this oil gives an instant softening effect as soon as you apply it. it isn't too oily as it quickly absorbs into the skin. 2-3 drops are the more enough to moisturizr the entire face. the next morning my skin still isn't dries out and the softness remains. definitely an oil to be used in all season if u don't want greasy skincare products on your face. i'm using this oil together with DE C-Firma and Fresh Leony Instant Brightening Serum and the result has been positive! my new acne scars fade very quickly, but the old scars are still here. mayb i need something potent for those.",0
"This one is a small mini size of eye pencil. I am using as an eye liner now. The texture is smooth so it doesn’t irritate my eye lines or skin.  Comparing to other brands’ eye liners that I have like Chanel, Nars, it’s not that bad at all. The only difference is the pigment. This one shows slightly less color when you apply so you might want to go 2times more.  Over all, with this price, I think I would try other colors as well.",2
"This on it's own, oh my god amazing. looks like skin but covers all my redness and acne spots without looking dry. If you wanna take this tint to the next level add the drunk elephant bronzing product, or any bronzing mix in product, it will look so good.",4
This palette has a lot of very pretty shades! has a nice variety of mattes and shimmers. blends really easily my only problem is it definitely fades after a long night out so it may be a tad overpriced. Primer and setting spray do help but still found it kind I'd came off my eyelids.,1
"This palette has six  gorgeous colors that is so bright.  \nIt is such a stunning palette.  The colors popped and I absolutely loved it.  When I was in the store I walked by the area a  few times and then I swatched it.  It was so buttery, so smooth, and didnt leave behind any fallout.  I would love to try another color story, so here is hoping for something exciting and mew in the near future.",3
"This palette is absolutely gorgeous! I just recently got it in, and I'm in love. Every color is pigmented and goes on wonderfully. I like that this palette encourages me to actually try something other than a neutral look.",1
"This palette is amazing, I bought many eyeshadow palettes before but never get a satisfied effect, I thought the reason is my poor skill (maybe it is), but this onemade me fell in love on the first try.",1
"this palette is beautiful. the shimmers are some of the most beautiful shimmers I have ever used. If you love neutral/nude palettes, this is the palette for you. i also like that they added a cream concealer shade to this palette.",1
"this palette is ok.  I love the shade range, however you really have to pack it on to get it to show up.  I have paler skin and cant see the rose and peach shades very well at all.  I find that the shadows really dry out my skin and make my lids look crepey.  I will probably not buy another palette by this brand after my experience with this palette.",2
"This palette is small (4.25"" x 3.0""), but it's perfect size to throw in your purse for touch ups. It has 6 eye shadows (1g ea = 6g total wt.). Inside are 2 mattes: black & rust brown; 4 shimmers: lt. gold, antique gold, rosy brown, & deep plum. The kit includes a deluxe sample sized mascara & rosy pink glitter pigment (1g). I included pics to show size & colors.",3
"This palette is so beautiful! I was so excited to receive this just before the holidays began because it has the most glamorous as well as neutral shades to it. It has both warm and soft tones with a hint of glitz that was perfect for my thanksgiving day gatherings. the shadows were so soft and light on my lids so I didn't feel like i had a lot on. I also have to mention the packaging, if you are someone who travels or keeps their makeup in your purse for on the go, this palette is perfect because it has a strong magnetic closure with a sizable mirror on the inside for ease of application for all your makeup needs !",1
"This palette is soooo beautiful. ILY has become my go to black and TBT is one of my all time favourite shades. All of the colours are very pigmented and blendable, one of my favourite palettes lately. Absolutely gorgeous!",4
"This palette looks so good on dark skin. at first I was scared I wouldn't be able to make softer looks with it but mixing 2 of the colors I can make every day to work looks. when I want, it's easy to glitz up a bit. I love the size for traveling and the pigment is fantastic. plus I just love Jackie !",4
"This palette makes it look like you rubbed dirt and mud all over your face.  Even the highlighters are dark and don't reflect light.  The shades are very reminiscent of a heat eyeshadow palette so it might be usable on your lids.  The blush is the color of straight up mud.  Otherwise, the formula is smooth and buttery.  The colors are just too dark for a darker medium complexion.",1
"This palette was meant to be my first dip into using more color on my eyes. It's not pigmented enough for me. The color is there, but you have to build/not blend too much as it can get muddy once you start putting other colors with it. Luckily, it's cheap, but it performs like it.",3
This pallet is so good I dont know where to start. I'll admit the shades and the price are a little scary but it is literally perfect. These shades are so blendable and buildable.  you only need a little product to get huge results. That dark raspberry is stunning on the skin. Just use it sparingly.,3
"this pencil lasted me almost a year with every day use. It goes on so smooth and doesn't give me racoon eyes. It is long lasting but won't necessarily hold 100% in the waterline, despite this I've made my second purchase. I've tried many different types of liners and this one is so far my favorite.",1
"This pigment palette has great color payoff, I am impressed. Love the colors, it's definitely something you don't have already! That green/teal is what makeup dreams are made of. They do feel dry, it's pressed pigments after all, and the lime shimmer has a bit of fallout. The 3 darkest shades stained but that's a bit to be expected with pigments... I think this is unique and performs really well, I'm really happy with this purchase!",1
This plum colour is amazing. The packaging is fantastic and do they ever give you a lot in the pan. I find the shadow very buttery and applies so well with very little fuss. Also blends out like a dream.,4
This polish made my nails look so shiny and glossy. I really love the curved bristles of the brush. It made it super easy to create a neat edge along my cuticles. The color payoff was great too--super rich and saturated. I wish it came in a bigger bottle. That would be my only ask.,1
"this powder cakes on me so much, regardless of what primer I'm using or if I've exfoliated my skin. no setting mist can ever fix it, I have no idea why it's so bad on me. when I say its cakey, I mean CAKEY. and some parts of my face just has no makeup left.",4
"This powder claims to diminish pores, however I haven’t had that experience while using it. It is a nice plain white powder that does reduce shine and set makeup. But it is really white. Like flour white.",3
This powder ROCKS! I LOVE the satin finish that pleasantly covers those fine lines and imperfections. I opened the box immediately to try. It makes me feel as if nothings there! My skin doesn't feel dry or irritated. This will be one of my favs!!,1
"This powder worked so well for be! Before receiving this powder, I didn't really use setting powder because it would just sit on my skin and do nothing but this powder really worked well for me. It helped keep my makeup on (no foundation left on my screen after talking on the phone! yay!) and matched well with all my other face makeup. I also loved that it helped keep my shine away in my face which is a huge added bonus for me! Definitely recommend!",1
This powder works very well for me. It evens my skintone. It does not dry my already dry skin or clog my pores. I did not notice the minute sparkles until it was mentioned in other reviews.  It's really good to set your makeup or go for a natural look. It is not as deep a pink as the photo shows.,3
"This primer did nothing to set my foundation or improve wearability. It went on thick, didn't improve my skin pre-application or improve wear. It almost felt like it needed to be set with powder before applying liquid fountain. Unfortunately I tried the the same time I tried a new foundation; I'm not sure which product caused my breakouts, but my skin hasn't been this bad in years. Regardless, I did not find the primer effective.",1
This primer is everything. I bought it because Jefree Starr uses it and wow was I impressed. not only does it go on like butter but it leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized. And can we talk about the smell?? it smells like heaven. I actually put on too much because I love it so much,2
"This primer is okay... nothing to write home about. It did its job in providing a smooth surface for foundation, but I don't feel like it particularly helped the foundation last any longer. It also depends on your preference - I personally don't love silicone-y primers where it feels like a slick layer is just sitting on top of your skin. I should've caught the dimethicone in the ingredients and stopped myself from buying it (oops!). It does have a subtle sheen to it, but because it's so sheer, unless you were wearing a BB-cream or tinted moisturiser, your foundation will most likely cover it. If you'd like a brightening/glowy layer under your foundation, Becca or Charlotte Tilbury might do a better job.",0
"This product arrived on Wednesday. Having read the stories of breakouts and stinging, I've been applying it to increasing parts of my face each day, starting from the least sensitive (just the forehead) to the most sensitive (upper cheekbones, don't ask). It stung a little today, but overall, doesn't bother me. \n\nI've discovered that I actually don't like the smell of the silicone substrate; my solution is to apply this first, then other serums, and let the other serums dilute the smell on my fingers.\n\nI imagine this is the type of product where you can't tell if it's effective until a few months (or decades) in, so I'll leave it at that and update this review later.",0
this product changed my skin. Favorite Clinique product. I didn't realize how much my skin needed moisture. We think to only add in more moisture when we have dry flaky skin... I my skin wasn't that dry and still this product brought back the youth and softness to my skin like no other product I have used. I will definitely buy again!,4
"This product completely changed my super oily/combo skin! I've never had good luck with oil or balm cleansers and I tend to break out or it just feels like I have a ton of oil left on my skin after I wash my face. After using this for about 3 weeks my skin is hydrated, some of my spots are going away and oil production in my face has gone wayyyyy down and the dry patches I've gotten this winter before using this product are nonexistent! I was so surprised at how it rinses off so easily off your face!! I used almost a whole 3.4 oz jar before writing a review because I didn't expect anything from it.  If you have oily or combo skin I highly suggest giving this a shot for makeup removal or just ad a face cleanser in general.",2
"This product definitely comes with a learning curve. I recommend applying it and sheering it out with a separate eyeshadow brush. It also dries very quickly, so you have to move fast. As a solo shadow, I recommend using a tacky primer underneath to alleviate fallout. Other than the trickiness of use, this is a sparkling primer, topper or solo color that is longwearing and very pretty!",2
"This product definitely smoothed out my fine lines! When using this device with the serum, I saw quick results in my eye area - primarily for my up and coming crow's feet. \n\n4 stars instead of 5 because you have to use the expensive serum to use the device.",2
This product definitely works however I found it making my face more oily. I started primarily using it on my neck and chest and saw improvement within a couple uses. I recieved this product free for testing purposes.,1
"This product did nothing for me and I’m honesty confused. I purchased it after seeing the amazing reviews online, but sadly it did nothing for my skin. Not sure if it’s because my skincare routine is already pretty tight or what. See my full review on my yt channel (keikobeauty). Maybe this will work for someone else, but sadly it didn’t for me.",0
This product did not work at all for my skin. I was very disappointed because the sales rep at Sephora recommended it to me. I guess it wasn't good for me because one of the main ingredients is alcohol. My skin does not react well to that. Its one of the top 5 meaning the product contains most of that.,1
This product does a great job of blurring the pores away from my T zone without drying my skin. I tried a different product that had more longevity but dryed my skin and made my foundation look peely. This product is a good compromise I only have to touch up my nose for the most part.,4
This product feels nice and sinks into my skin pretty quickly. I've been using this for the past 3 weeks and it has broken me out. My skin is not acne prone and I usually never have any break outs. I've noticed that I have a lot of white heads around my nose and mouth after using this product for the past 3 weeks.,0
This product genuinely helped to heal a bad rash that I had on my body.  I was shocked when I woke up the next day to see how good my skin looked after being such a red mess the day before.  The product is light and it sinks right into the skin.  Looking forward to using it on my face and body as needed.  You really can't go wrong with anything that Belif puts out.,0
"This product got a lot of great reviews, so I guess I had really high expectations. It's okay and for the price, it's worth a try. 50mL of cleanser really isn't a lot of cleanser. I can only use it in the morning before I put on makeup. It says that it removes makeup but it wouldn't even wash off tinted moisturizer. It does leave my skin feeling soft.",1
"This product had good reviews online so I tried it and love the results! I'm 46 with combination skin, a few fine lines and large pores and this helps minimize them. It makes my skin look softer and smoother without makeup too.",3
"This product has had an amazing visible impact on my skin. Within a few uses my skin was the smoothest it has ever been as an adult. Although it is very expensive, I will almost certainly continue to use it as it has such an undeniable benefit. It can be drying so I follow I with a facial oil and a night sleeping hydrating mask. My skin is like butter in the morning.",2
"This product has premium feel to it, and is very soothing. However, I didn’t notice any brightness or changes in my skin after several applications. It also leaves a strange residue on the skin after you rub it in. It’s nice to use in terms of feeling pampered but I wouldn’t purchase it for myself.",0
"This product has such great reviews so I'm sad it didn't work for me. I tried it for a few weeks but would wake up with MASSIVE breakouts every morning after applying it. Very painful acne, and made my skin much drier and tight feeling.",4
"This product healed the worst scaley, dry, flakey eyelids of my life.  My lids were so bad, everything was stinging, even Neosporin.  I was about to go to the doctor for help but this product finally did the trick.  The only reason I don't give it 5 of 5 stars is because it is a little messy.  It is a thick ointment that will become more runny as it warms up to your skin temperature.  Not conducive to applying makeup on top of... but it works.",2
This product is absolutely amazing. It's been really hard to find a night time mask to take away the redness. It leaves my face hydrated and super soft. I've even got my husband using this product every night!! I will continue buying this for sure!!!,2
"This product is a good product but so expensive if you want to pay full price. Personally it isn't the price that bothers me because I love the instant perfection fresh mask and I paid over 90 bucks for it and I love it.  When eye balling the ingredient list it does have a paraben in it. Therefore, I will continue to use the rest of the lotion and maybe the essence and after that I will be done. I prefer the drunk elephant protini. It works better for my skin for half the cost, with more safer  ingredients.  One star was deducted for the price and another was deducted for ingredients.",4
This product is amazing. After only a couple uses I can see a difference in my skin. It's absolutely glowing and I can see my acne blemishes and scars slowly fading.I am 100% going to buy it again. I received this product for free for an unbiased review.,1
"this product is amazing, get ready for glowy hydrated skin!! there are two sizes for it, the pads are soaked, sometimes i even cut the pad in half-still works great. I use a pad in the morning before my makeup and it instantly gives a vibrance  and freshens to my dull dry  skin.",0
"This product is amazing! I have and arsenal of products that I use and this will now be a part of it. I got a small size to start, because I wasn't too sure about it at first. But when I woke up my skin felt soft and was very calm. a little goes a long long way. I really fight with dry skin, even during the summer because I live in a very hot dry climate. If you have dry sensitive skin I'd say try it..  right now this is my favorite product and I've tried a few. And no .. this wasn't a free sample where they asked for me to review it.",3
"This product is amazing! I have been using this product for a month now. I tried it because I was breaking out and also had milia. It brought up the milia and pimples to the surface of my skin, so it got bad for maybe a week. However, now I haven't got any pimples since and my Milia did not come. It also balanced my skin tone. I took off one star because it leaves my skin just a little bit sticky after application, although that is small price to pay for my results.",4
This product is AMAZING. I put it on after washing my face in the morning and before putting my makeup on. It makes my skin feel moisturized and soft along with evening out my skin tone. Definitely a game changer in my skin care routine. I received it free for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster.,1
This product is a MUST for me!  It's sooo light weight and natural looking that I can't even tell that I'm wearing it.  Becca has some wonderful products that give a sun kissed glow.  I wear this alone...no powder or foundation and it looks great.  The slightly dark discoloration under my eyes vanishes like magic with a few dabs.,3
this product is an absolute NO. it feels as if you are putting pineapple concentrate on your face. its extremely sticky and the smell is sooo strong. it made my face feel irritated and itchy. i didnt see any improvements what so ever,0
"This product is an amazing facial oil for acne prone skin. Rosehip oil will help with dehydration, acne scars & flakiness from acne treatments. It is lightweight & feels good on the complexion. I only use 2 drops & press it into my skin. It leaves a beautiful dewy finish. Cheers",3
"This product is a thicker cream consistency for mature skin or very dry eyes. It does not work for me during the day (under makeup) as it is a bit too ""greasy"" but perfect for night time. I also like to use it with a mask as it is super hydrating. A little goes a very long way and this quantity will last me for many months if not half a year.",3
"This product is awesome!  I love Farmacy's products.  This melts all the gunk, makeup, mascara into time flat and leaves your face SO soft.  LOVE IT!  I received a free sample and then when out and bought the big size.  Worth every penny!",3
"This product is awesome. It smells and has same consistency as the hand cream, only the hand cream seems to also have a strange sharp spicy smell that overpowers the light citrus underneath (I think someone in a review for the hand cream suggested black pepper and that sounds close to what I smell - it seems not everyone perceives this, which is not uncommon). In any event, it was not delicious smelling to me because of that very strong note. I definitely prefer this yummy body butter. It's certainly less expensive by volume than the hand cream, making it The One for me. This body butter is rich and creamy. Dry skin gulps it down quickly without being left to feel greasy. I use a small spatula to dole out the product to minimize contamination. The only thing I would change would be to package it in a tube or one of those sealed jars with the press-down dispenser like Saturday Skin or Drunk Elephant. The product itself is wonderfully decadent and effective - my elbows, hands, feet and legs rejoice their moisturization!",3
"This product is awesome! It's quite pricedy but for the amount of product that you get is worth it. I had looked for a bronzer and contour kit/individuals in brands like too faced and was shocked that they didn't even have a shade close to mine. And when I asked a Sephora employee she recommended ABH, but it was either a cream contour kit, OR a powder one. I honestly don't understand why this kit isn't available in stores because it works so well! Urban Decay is officially my favorite brand.",0
"this product is awful. i gave it 5 tries.. no more.. every time i used it i would wake up with severely swollen itchy eyes. i thought it might be some other lotion or something, but no, it's this. I'm not particularly sensitive, with normal to combo skin. this cream lists SO many ingredients that i can't possibly figure out what it is. HARD PASS!",3
"This product is easy to use , change was very little compared to what I was expecting. Broke me out around the area where I applied serum to use the device . If you are not a acne prone then u will do fine with it .",0
"This product is exactly what I think most people are looking for in a skin care product.  I don't know that it has made any significant long term changes in the skin around my eyes . . . I have only been using it for one month.  No changes yet, but this may not be enough time.  However, I can speak to the short term: lightening, brightening, tightening and acts like a decent eye primer (at least on minimal makeup days).  So, if these are the things you're looking for, I would definitely recommend a purchase.",2
"this product is fantastic! I'm in love with the gel-creme formula.  my skin is instantly energized, smooth, plump and radiant! It always works great as a primer under makeup.  I will definitely be buying this again and recommending to anyone looking for a ""pick-me-up"" product in the morning!",2
This product is fantastic... my eyes always get allergies from purple or wine colored pencils. this one  does not bother me at all even when I put it in my water line.... it also stays put... doesn’t run or fade,3
"This product is fantastic. Period. It's absolutely lovely. I expected this to be something I only used when I was in a hurry, but as soon as this blush touched my face I was literally left with my jaw hanging open. It blends UNBELIEVABLY well and leaves just enough color in LITERALLY a single swipe, if you get the right amount of product on the brush (which I did on my first try). This color looks wonderful on my cool/neutral snow fair skin. It's got a satin finish that creates the perfect flush and it's so smooth that it never goes on patchy. I highly recommend!! I recieved a sample of this for reviewing purposes, but my opinions are 100% my own (and I'm seriosuly considering going to buy the full size!) Word of warning: if you're new to cream products, keep in mind that they do dry out eventually, so you cant keep them for years. I cant vouch for how long this product stays since I've just recieved it a week or so ago. However, my general advice for cream products is if you arent going to use it fairly regularly, consider a smaller and/or more affordable option :) I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0
"This product is For normal to dry skin type.  If you have oily skin or  are acne prone, this product is not for you.  I have oily skin and am acne prone.  This product caused acne , because it is not oil-free.  The bottle clearly states for “dry skin”, but we cannot see that phrase clearly from the website photo.",2
"this product is hard to blend for a more diffused edge, and applies blotchy with the thinner layers drying up faster. I had to cake it on just t get a decent look, and it really dried out my eyelids. not for dry skin. moves under gloss.",0
"This product is incredibly low quality. It does not plump lips, it truly dries out lips more than moisturizes them. The color is incredibly tacky and the way it sits on the lips looks absolutely terrible like lipsticks that come in children's makeup kits. It doesn't look right.. I don't know if they sent me old product, but it looks awful, feels awful on my lips, and honestly is a let down.",0
"This product is new to me. I have just started using it but I love the deep, lasting pigments that it has that you do not always get from eyeshadows.  Nice and compact as well for the ease of bringing with you or traveling. Great product and worth the price as a little goes a long way! So glad I tried it!!",3
This product  is okay but nothing even close to the price. I had high hope's but it just didn't do anything for me I have normal to dry skin and I'm 60 I had hoped it would help cover some lines it's says it stays on the surface and glides right over to help with lines ect.. I tried everything before foundations after foundations just with a BB cream it would wind up rolling up and having to be removed. I will go back to Smashbox photo finish silicone primer.,4
this product is okay. I really dont feel much of a difference when I use this. if you need something on the go this may be perfect for you. it does feel very clean and has a refreshing smell though. I personally wouldnt recommend this product unless you need something on the go. I received this product free for testing purposes.,0
This product is ok but it is almost impossible to use the correct amount. If you use even a tiny but too much then it leaves your eye area looking artificially white and cakey. If you use the right amount the results are amazing. It is very unforgiving.  You only need a very small amount...anything else and you end up looking ridiculous.,4
"This product is one of the few that does help depuff my undereye, but it only seems slightly effective on my dark circles and it is not moisturizing. It does feel like it strengthens the skin but doesn't feel like its adding moisture. It's an okay product but I really with it did more brightening. Still searching for a product that does more for dark circles, but I'll use this in the meantime to depuff.",1
"This product is quite a pleasant experience. I did not receive the mousse container, but a small travel size container. Not sure if that makes a difference. This clay is the perfect texture, goes on very smooth, does not dry out skin and is easy to remove from your face. I felt like I was at the spa when I put this product on.",0
This product is so awesome!!! I have tried so many setting powders and the just leave my under eye looking dry and cakey. This great for setting under the eye and all over your face. I feels so hydrating and cooling going on your skin. This product is going in my must have category. I LOVE IT!!!,2
"This product is so versatile! You can use it alone, mixed with moisturizer or makeup or under spf! My skin looks and feel more radiant and I have a much smoother look to my skin than I did before trying this out. My skin feels and looks more hydrated, goodbye flaky patches and hello glow! I did receive this product for testing purposes but all opinions are my own!",0
"This product is terrific.  Amazing!  I have tried, sampled and bought probably 30 products to camouflage my dark undereye circles, and I almost despaired of finding anything that would work for me. Then I saw a review of this on Youtube and decided to try yet another one.  This one is different!  The color on my computer is misleading - I got Light-Medium and it is a very forgiving formula, that has a flesh tone that will likely work with many skin tones.  There's also a darker version.  With this I don't need to apply concealer on top.  It's just different from any other corrector or concealer.  If you are frustrated trying to find something that works, give this a shot. Wonderful Sephora, you can return it if it doesn't work for you.",2
"This product is the first true cream contour I have ever used. I've always used a darker shade concealer in the past. With that being said this product was so easy to blend and came out very natural looking. It's an interesting consistancy in the pan. Not a ton of product comes up on a brush unless you use a beauty blender and dig into it. In my opinion that is a good thing. I need my makeup to force me to have a little self control. I like using my fingers to apply and then I blend it out with a brush. The highlighter is very natural and gives your skin almost a wet sheen look. It makes any powder highlighter applied on top last a long time. I like to use this product with no foundation too for a quick, no makeup - makeup look. It gives me a quick bronzed and defined look. I can see this product lasting me a long time. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, however my review is based on my honest opinion.",1
This product is thick so I felt like I needed a lot for my whole face. It does feel moisturizing and I love the smell. It reminds me of the yellow pez candy. The only issue I had with it is that it seemed a little patchy around my mouth once I applied my foundation. I did recieve this product free for review.,0
"This product is wonderful! So wonderful in fact, that this is my first ever review on Sephora. I was a little skeptical of buying an oil because I have acne prone, oily and dehydrated skin, but this is an absolute game-changer and has only improved the appearance, tone, and texture of my skin. This is my new must have!",4
This product literally works miracles for acne!! i know its not made for ance but I've been suffering from severe acne along my jaw line and didn't want to leave the house for months. ive been using this product ever 2/3 days for almost 2 weeks & my acne is almost gone!! all i can say is this stuff works miracles!!,0
"This product moisturizes and has such great coverage alm day! I have been struggling finding the right natural foundation for my flaky dry skin, but this product does everything I wanted and more! My skin feels soft and plump all day. My complexion evens out without looking flat and dull. The best part is that this doesn't transfer! Overall extremely satisfied and I think I may have found my foundation.",0
"This product smells so good, and doesn't irritate my skin at all! It also helps calm my breakouts. However, I can't apply this before i put on makeup. I have to wait 10-20 minutes after or my concealer/foundation will ball up.",0
"This product started my obsession with Sunday Riley. \n\nI bought multiple water gel moisturizers from Sephora. I tried each for a week. Tidal was my last one. I thought I had found my new moisturizer in Boscia Cactus Water, but since Tidal was the last one left, I though ""what the heck, may as well try it"". \n\nI know you're thinking ""okay. its moisturizer. nothing earth shattering"". kwhdidonsjdinff WRONG. This stuff is like a cold cucumber bath for your face. Nothing compares. \n\nI have very sensitive skin, and this stuff soaks into my face and feels amazing. No stickiness or itchiness. And a little goes a long way!",1
"This product used to be $275. Now, at $360, it is absolutely ridiculous. I had purchased this last year and it was not until I got to the end of the bottle that I saw ANY benefit. It's not bad, but it's very, very mild. Almost any retinoid product would give you a better result, and much faster. When I saw this product's price went up to $360, I wanted to throw up in my mouth! What a scam! I almost never post reviews on Sephora, but unless flushing $360 down the toilet won't make a dent in your life, save it! This is a ridiculous gimmick.",0
This product was horrible. I used this for years and then ordered the 4oz jar. And hated it. Did some digging around and found out they changed the formula. Actually made my skin dry. Wasted over $100. Really upset. For items also agrees  do not recommend this new formula,3
"This product was hydrating under the eyes. I would only wear this on days that I wasn't wearing any makeup, because for some strange reason, my concealer didn't blend well and looked patchy with it   Didn't notice any brightness either under my eyes.",2
"This product was recommended to me by a Sephora employee after I told her I was searching for a brightening and moisturizing eye cream. I loved the texture of this product and the way it felt on my skin, but after a few days I developed dry red patches near the corners on my eyes! I went back to my old eye cream for a few days and they disappeared so I decided to give this another try.... the dry spots came right back. I also didn't notice any difference in the brightness of the skin around my eyes. If anything, it was a little worse.",0
"This product was terrible for me, and I had such high hopes. It went on blotchy whether I had zero makeup on or a full face. I'm always moisturized, so I know it wasn't picking up on dry patches. I also tried applying with my fingers and with a sponge, but neither worked. I'll be looking for a different kind of cream or gel blush, because I took this one back after several failed attempts. I got this in the color lotus (red) but it wasn't available to select.",4
"This product works well. It makes the eye area subtly brighter, it blends in/absorbs easily. (The product is tinted with a slight shimmer) I use Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen religiously and this was easy and quick to add into my routine. This product doesn't affect application or wear of my eye makeup. I have oily lids and sometimes different eye creams make my eyeliner smudge easier. This product does not and I am so glad to have the extra spf protection around the eyes.",2
"This product works well, so for that it has more than 1 star.  The taste is sickeningly sweet and scent so potent it seems to invade the air.  My husband asked what the heck he was smelling.  With so many other good lip treatment and conditioning options, do yourself a favor and bypass this.",3
"This quad has all the right colors to create everything from full glam to light everyday wear. The formula has little to no fallout on application, and the pigment is insane. I love shimmers that blend effortlessly with brush and fingers. Just a slight sweep for a glowing wet lid, or for a more foiled look I dampen my finger and tap it on my lid. Heavenly! Smooth, not patchy and it stays put all day. The size is perfect for travel and not hard to store or carry, compared to larger palettes. It's a definite keeper, a great companion to my well loved golden mink. Absolutely worth the coin!",4
This received a rave review in Good Housekeeping mag so i tried it.  I love it! I do see a difference; my eyes are tighter and brighter--more toned. I haven't seen a change in my dark circles but i didn't expect to.  I use this 2x daily and then lancome absolue eye cream on top for more hydration (also recommended  by GH and it's the bomb).  Perfect combo for me!,2
"This reformulated product is terrible. It's so thin that it rubs off really quickly after applying and leaves a weird film on your lips. Before, it had a pleasant vanilla smell, but now it smells very gross and chemical-y. It also isn't nearly as moisturizing as before. I've sworn by this product for years and it used to be the only product I needed to keep my lips from cracking, and it worked so well that it was worth the high price, but I won't be buying any more of this unless they go back to the old formula. Save your money and try a different product.",0
"This review is of Le Macaron. \nThese shadows don't match the color swatches provided by Violet Voss whatsoever. You will not in any way get the brilliant colors presented in the photos. Literally not one shade matches. The colors in actuality are extremely muted versions of the shades presented, with the purple being particularly galling as it is blue with sparkles rather than purple.",2
"This right here!!!! Ohhhhhh my oh my. If you have a heavy hand, I'll tell you be gentle when applying unless you like the look of a solid gold bar. Rihanna and Fenty put their foot in this pigment. I LOVE IT!!!",2
"This saved my skin in the winter time. I have really dry, eczema-prone skin and I use this during the day in the winter time and I feel hydrated all day long. It also makes a HUGE difference in the way my makeup wears. It allows it to last all day without looking dry or cakey. This during the day and the First Aid Beauty at night is what keeps my eczema at bay. Ceramidins and oatmeal extracts are wonderful for eczema so if you struggle with that too, you will love this and the First Aid beauty",0
This serum feels really nice and goes nicely on my skin. I have not been using it long enough to say just how well it does as promises though. I'll continue to use it because it feels great. \n\nI received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.,2
"This serum is amazing on aged dry skin. I apply it twice a day, pre-makeup and post-makeup. This product helps my concealer stay put and not accentuate my fine lines. The serum has a thick consistency but feels light weight upon application. A little goes a long way for sure. It has a light pleasant scent.",3
"This serum is great! I use it right after washing face morning and night. The name water bank is so fitting because it feels like you are giving your face a drink of water. A little but goes a long way, it glides across your face with ease. It does have a slight scent to it. but it's so faint I barely noticed it. I love how smooth it makes my face look and sits so well under make up. I did receive this from influencer for review purposes and ask glad I did!!",1
"This serum is so luxurious! I absolutely love using it morning and night because it is really light but really seems to lock in the moisture. Since using this my skin is plumper and more hydrated and as a result my fine lines aren’t as noticeable. Hopefully with continued use it will help diminish my fine lines and prevent new ones. \n\nThe bottle is gorgeous and looks amazing on my vanity. If you have dry skin this makes an amazing serum to use before moisturizer. If your skin is oily this is hydrating enough to not have to use a moisturizer afterwards. It has hyaluronic acid in it which is super hydrating! I use this under foundation and it helps my foundation go on smoothly, no pilling at all. I received a sample of this product from YSL in exchange for my honest opinion.",0
This serum is very lightweight and non-disruptive under makeup and moisturizer. I appreciate that it can work its magic without disrupting the look and feel of my day. It also smells amazing so I don’t mind having it on my face. This serum has inspired me to check out other products from this brand.\n\nI received this product complimentary for testing purposes.,0
This serum is very soothing without any hint of fragrance! I immediately see results in terms of the glow it gives my skin and the plumping. I use this in my a.m. routine and a little goes a long way. I typically use 3 drops and covers my entire face and neck area. Love this brand!!!,1
"This serum...ugh. Where do I begin? I've been using this under my makeup for the past week, and I can definitely tell a difference in how my makeup applies. I've noticed that my under eyes don't crease as quickly, and my skin looks so much more flawless. Like the Laneige Water Bank Moisturizer, this product doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy, and it smells AMAZING. It's lightweight and actually sinks into the skin beautifully. I cannot recommend this enough! Plus, the packaging is stunning! \n\nSide note: I received this product for free for the purpose of reviewing it, but that in no way changes my opinions.",0
"this serum works great when it comes to firming skin and hiding fine lines but I already have a serum that does that just as good, with a less expensive price tag. I only use this when I'm using my nuface fix device since they're meant to go with each other. however, if I could use a different serum with the device I wouldn't even use this at all. I would use my other serums that I already have. the one that I received free for reviewing purposes came with the device and is very small and I am going to experiment with other serums with the device before purchasing this serum on my own. the four stars is for price, other than that it would have gotten five for how great it works with blurring fine lines and wrinkles and tightening the skin up a bit.",1
"This set comes with minis? If I had known I was just going to get the Brazilian bum bum mini I would have just spent my money on a full size jar. The only thing that is full size is the lip balm! What a tease! This is my Christmas ""splurge.""",2
"This set dropped at the perfect time of year. This is the perfect moisturizer for those harsh, winter months. It's SUPER moisturizing! I go through tons and i mean tons of moisturizer. This brand actually last me longer than any other brand I've used (DE,SR,Origins,etc.) A little goes a very long way and I have severely dry skin this time of year. The peel and toner are also extraordinary! The only toner I've tried that doesn't upset my skin and actually moisturizes. The only product I won't buy the full size of is the lip mask. It's hard to beat the Laneige lip mask but this is a close dupe with clean ingredients. Everyone should buy this set!",2
This set is a good value. I think the bag is really cute. It is soft sided.  The Guelain Kiss Kiss Coral is a light semi bright coral. Almost a retro color in a good formula. The Amorepacific peel works pretty well but seems better once a day rather than twice. The Tata Harper didn't irritate my skin and smooths my skin well. The Hourglass primer I would not purchase. It made my foundation dry. The YSL mascara lengthens but does not make my lashes thick. The SK II essence soothed my skin. It smells good. Glad I got one of these sets.,3
"This set is a great deal. I  bought this set as a friend was raving about the Tacha mask. I also enjoy Glamglow and Dr. Jart.  I liked all the masks.  I even just bought 3 of these sets for Xmas gifts (November 20% off).  A great gift idea!  A great Sephora Favorites -- a great find, well worth the cost.",4
"This set is a great value for the price. The Laneige lip mask is wonderful for dry chapped lips. The Milk lip balm is very moisturizing and I love the tingly minty sensation. I've tried the Fresh lip balm before and I know I don't like it so I'll be gifting it to someone else, but a lot of people love this lip balm. I like the roller lip gloss, it smells and tastes good, not sticky and feels nice on the lips. I really like the colour of the Charlotte Tilbury lipstick, it's a pretty taupe nude, but the formula is a bit disappointing. It feels comfortable on the lips however it's not very pigmented and I have to apply it a couple times to get even colour. I already own the Too Faced lipstick in the same shade and it's one of my all time favourite nudes, so I'll be keeping it in my bag. The Fenty lipstick is really nice, not a fan of bright berry colours but I love the formula. It's very pigmented and comfortable and wears for a long time. I've already tried the Sephora lip stain formula and it's one of the only liquid lipsticks that doesn't dry out my lips. The shade is a very pretty warm red, perfect for Christmas. I highly recommend getting this set since it's on sale right now!",0
"This set is a great value with a few of my absolute favorites and getting to try some new things from Origins. The moisturizers especially are a great value since the full size is 1.7oz and you're getting 1oz of product each in this. My longtime favorites are the Night-a-mins night cream and the Mega Mushroom toner lotion, but they're a bit too spendy to repurchase as often as I go through them at the moment, so this kit was a steal for me.",1
This set is a great way to try all the different Sugar Lips shades at a discount!  It comes in the CUTEST packaging so it would make a great gift. I love all the Sugar Lips shades and this set is such a good value. Now I can keep a Sugar Lip in each purse and always have it on hand. These are really moisturizing and provide a tint of color to your lips. My favorite shade is the Sugar Rose for a hint of color that moisturizes and looks so natural. I received this product as a free sample to try.,0
"This set is amazing and it's a great value. I love the peel pads, but the liquid peel was a nice surprise! My skin looks so good that I barely wear much makeup now, and the rest of my skincare soaks in better thanks to these pads. Just get it. It's so worth it.",4
"This set is an amazing value for the products! There are two tinted ones though, so it's a bit of a niche set. I'd been wanting to try the Cicapair on my rosacea/sensitive skin, so I went for it. Pleasantly surprised! Usually anything tinted just settles into my pores but the Cicapair melted in and looked perfectly natural all day (I do have fair skin though). The Cerimidin cream is a life saver now that my dry winter skin is back. The mask is amazing (like all of Dr. Jart's masks!). Micellar water does the job, it's nice to have a travel size. I haven't tried the BB Cream yet. Even if one of the products in this set isn't quite for you, it's still a great value and an opportunity to try out products you may have your eye on!",1
"This set is a seriously good deal, considering the full size of the DE Vitamin C Serum is $80 and this set is $88 with 4 other minis! I'd needed to stock up on a new vitamin c serum and this was a good way to get into DE products without spending a crap-ton of money :') So far I'm really loving everything exceeeeeept for maybe the Umbra sunscreen, which I gave to my sister who loves it.",4
"This set is AWESOME! I love Olehendrickson skin care, the products actually give me a noticeable difference in my skin. I use the truth serum and banana bright eye cream every morning. My skin looks brighter and more even toned and my dark circles have really faded. The c rush cream is great too, it's a lightweight gel-like texture that soaks in quickly and provides alot of moisture. I love the primer too, it makes a great base under foundation and I love skin care benefits in my primers. The full size 1 oz truth serum is $49 by itself so you are basically paying a buck to try out the rest of Ole's AMAZING products! Such a great value and all the products are truly great!",1
"This set is great, and these three products really are the pillars of daily skin care.  I've tried various TO products, and the serum in this set had already become a staple for me.  It hydrates better than products costing ten times the price.  I wanted to try the cleanser and the moisturizer at some point, so I grabbed this as soon as I saw it.  They don't disappoint.  This set is great for anyone wanting quality skin care on a budget, anyone starting out on skin care (teens, men, etc), anyone curious about the brand, and anyone with sensitive skin that's hard to please.  It also makes a great gift for any of those people, or a Secret Santa exchange.   It's also travel friendly, and nobody doesn't need that.",3
"This set is great if only bc you are getting a full-size of the 2 oz size (does that make sense? lol you know, not the jar size but not a deluxe sample by any means) of the Ultra Repair Cream PLUS the lip balm for the same price as the cream alone (2oz tube retails for $12). So you are getting another product for free, how exciting! As far as the cream itself, it's my absolute savior in winter months. Totally legitimizes this brand calling itself First Aid Beauty, bc boy does it come to my skin's rescue. I get very dry and dehydrated in winter months, so much so that parts of my neck become very red and irritated and painful - Ultra Repair Cream is the only product to help with this. Since I have dry skin I sometimes layer another moisturizer on top of this, one that has more anti-aging ingredients for ex, but that's bc I feel like Ultra Repair Cream is more of my treatment lotion - really fixes all my dryness problems when nothing else does. The lip blam is ok....it has a nice mentholy effect, but it's nothing remarkable.  wouldn't purchase the lip therapy on its own again probably. But this would make a great gift for a dry skin person in your life who like clean, simple hydration. Big fan!",1
This set is not just phenomenal value for money but the product itself is excellent!!! I'm olive skinned and have been able to use the bronzer and various blushes! the highlighters are excellent too!! very natural looking too and doesn't break me out. My friend bought the set so she can use the individual ones as stocking stuffers.,2
"This set, like others have mentioned, is a fantastic value! 2 full sized mascara are included in the kit. I may purchase another one to have. Great for someone wanting to try different mascaras without a big commitment.",3
"This set seemed a tad bit intimidating, but since I love unusual colors I figured I might as well try them. The three are buildable from a sheer, tinted lip balm look to a full on lipstick. Provides tons of sheen and glitter and looks gorgeous as it is, but can also be added to other lipsticks (I usually just pat it on a matte lipstick since it already has a balmy texture, very hydrating). An extremely good buy before it's gone!",0
"This setting powder is not worth the hype. The packaging is horrible, the powder is super hard to get out, the holes are tiny and you have shake it and then you get powder everywhere. Didn't see a difference at all. Will stick with Laura Mercier powder for sure.",3
"This setting powder is pretty good compared to some of the reviews I've read. it is very dry, but if you have oily skin like mine, its not a problem. I love that this color doea not have that wierd grey cast some powders leave!  I dont have any cracking, and I have my normal crease from any makeup under my eye. It did stay out all day from cleaning to a party, it did not make me look ""melted"". By the way Pro Tip, most of the time your face will crack or separate is because you are using products with different bases together. if you want that airbrushed look then you need to learn about makeup, ingredients and what goes good together. \n*I did receive this complimentry from Influenster for my review.",0
This setting spray is amazing! It's my first experience using a setting spray so I purchased the mini to give it a try. I will most definitely be purchasing the full size when this runs out. I was amazed at how fresh it kept my face looking ALL day! Fresh and dewy and just perfect! I have pretty nice skin to begin with but as the day passes my pores start to become more obvious and my skin can look dry and tired. This completely remedied that! I'm in love!,4
"This setting spray is fantastic for dry, aging skin. I'm 46, normal to dry skin, and live in the desert, so moisture is a definite must for me. I've been wearing this over a matte foundation (L'oreal 24 hour fresh wear) and it is perfection. My skin looks like glass, and my makeup lasts all day. I do notice some wearing off on my chin by the end of the day but I touch my chin a lot, so not the spray's fault. It is pricey, yes, but I've tried so many sprays (pretty much all drug store ones, Urban Decay, Algenist) and none comes close to this. I love it. Doesn't collect in fine lines, crack or break up on me. So. So. So. GOOD.",3
This set was a total letdown. The colors were so pretty in the packaging but the color payoff and blendability was terrible. They were worse than drug store eye shadows.  The shimmers were ok if you used a wet brush.,2
This shade (#406) is exactly what I've been looking for. It is a beautiful red that's not too bright on darker skin. Other reds I've tried were always too bright or just not the right level of matte. I love this!,2
This shade and undertone didn't match me. But a little cream and powder fixes that. It is very light weight and has great coverage. I have dry skin for the most part and it covered my pores and imperfections. It made my skin feel velvety. You do need to shake it a lot because it's very watery if you don't. I'm willing to get matched and get it in my shade.,1
"This sheet mask is unlike any mask I've used before. It's ""dry"" as opposed to the ones soaking in serum and is completely mess free. It's easy to apply and once you have it secured, massage the surface lightly to activate the mask. The first time I used it I couldn't believe how great my skin looked. It was hydrated and absolutely glowing, like I had just had a facial. It's magic, indeed! I will definitely keep buying them.",3
"This smells so nice, the product is bouncy (soft to touch) easy to apply, but be careful it says it is translucent but if you apply to much you get a peachy glow on fair skin type. It looks funny, so much sure to apply a little at the time. Keeps makeup looking fresh all day",2
"This smells terrible, this is the only body cream I've ever thrown out in full. It's so awful I didn't want to give it to anyone. I don't understand how people can stand it. It smells like fake artificial floral butter cream in a pukey way.",2
this spf is amazing!!!! very lightweight but yet it has spf 50. I put this first then my mosturizer cuz I Wana make sure my fave is protected. the tint is perfect and it blends in perfectly . I'm buying my second bottle. also I love how it's small since I travel a lot. it is perfect !! highly recommended.!!,4
This spray did nothing for my oily skin: it didn't reduce shine and it didn't reduce daily overall oil - it did nothing. I might as well just spray plain water on my face cause that's what it looked like. I tried spraying it at different distances to my face as well as shaking it to no end - no difference. \nI returned my expensive water mister cause powder and setting sprays do much better jobs -they actually do 'something ',4
This spray is good to begin with. This small bottle alone will last me a while.  I think I'll buy the bigger bottle too though so I have something nice to smell into miserable winter time.  \nIt seriously smells just like summer. Oh and it doesn't linger. I actually wouldn't mind that though.  Lol,3
"This squishy case is approximately 3-4 inches long depending how firmly you press this case together. It's bulky, sure, but that allows for plenty of airflow for your sponge to dry. I don't believe you could fit 2 full size blenders in this case, but I'm able to keep a Real Techniques sponge and a small Morphe concealer sponge in it at the same time. My only complaint is that I worry it will work itself open in my makeup bag while I travel. That hasn't happened yet, but it just slides open and closed.",1
This stays on for hours without drying my lips even a little bit. The applicator is perfect for lining the lips. The colour is pigmented without being too much. I get alot of compliments when I have this on. I have other shades of this lippie!,4
This stays on my lips all night! So moisturizing! I only use it at night and it has lasted so long. I would use it all the time but I don't like reaching into a pot with my fingers throughout the day. Love all Bite Beauty products!,2
This st**** product broke me out so bad. I have a million little white heads on my face because of this item. It’s crazy how many crazy raving reviews it has but yet here I am dealing with these white heads. New one pops up every minute. and my face just felt so rough. I went back and fourth with this product for months  the first time I tried it at night woke up with white heads. So I stopped. I started again within the next few months same thing. Two days ago I gave it a try again. I put it on in the morning first then by night I got white heads so I’m like okay let me just wash my face and try it again and the next day I just saw so much white heads on my chin mouth area and jaw. My face felt so rough and bumpy and gross. NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN! I HATE THIS PRODUCT TO THE LUCKY ONES GREAT BUT THERES NO SUCH THING AS PURGING STAGE. THATS STUPID. BECAUSE THERE ARE SOLE PRODUCTS THAT DOESNT EVEN GO THROUGH PURGING STAGE. SO IF THIS PRODUCT BROKE YOU OUT RETURN/THROW IT THE NEXT STEP. HORRIBLE PRODUCT,0
"This stuff can cover your dark circles, anxiety, and your past!! Smooth and super easy to blend out. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars, is because it's very thick. I love full coverage, but I have to apply this VERY lightly. Maybe only about 3 small dots under my eyes. I suppose that means it'll last forever...\n\nI have yet to find anything that can keep up with my smile lines and undereye lines (I'm 18 and I've dealt with them since I started wearing makeup). This does hold up the longest though. I'm extremely impressed and I use this along with the rest of the Pro Filt'r collection as a basis of quality for other brands.",0
"This stuff changed the game for me. I Have been on retin a for years for my acne, and when I got nexplanon (the birth control implant) it destroyed my skin and I started breaking out like crazy. Nothing helped - and I mean i tried everything to get rid of the acne and dark spots left behind. Dr Dennis gross, drunk elephant, Murad, you name it. Started taking this about 5 weeks ago, and omg i don't get any hormonal breakouts anymore. This stuff has made me more confident about my skin, and it sure makes periods suck less",4
"This stuff definitely creases. I am glad I only bought the mini instead of full size. I usually love anything from the Tarte line, but when a coworker says ""you look rough, have you slept?"" I'm inclined to think this concealer isnt doing its job. The formula does go on thick and the applicator is a nice doe foot, but it will definitely settle into anything and everything you've been wanting to hide.",1
"This stuff has definitely helped improve the texture in my (dry, sensitive, acne prone) skin and has made me switch from physical exfoliaters to chemical ones like this. It might be good to try to get a sample first, I let my coworker borrow it to try it and she didn't care for it. Great brand, fair price and cool dispenser on the top!",1
"This stuff is amazing. I have combination skin that gets very oily in the t-zone, but also gets very dry in the t-zone if I don't exfoliate often and moisturize. (I use around 2 to 3 times a week) This stuff makes your skin feel so soft and smooth!! I don't have sensitive skin, but it does kind of have a tingling feeling when you first put it on. I had my eye on it for a while, but was apprehensive on purchasing because the price. Well fate intervened and I ended up getting it in my fabfitfun box and holy crap I don't care how much this costs, I will forever repurchase. I have since, gotten three of my friends hooked on it too.",4
"This stuff is amazing. I thought that I was still in the evaluation phase, then I realized that I was on my 3rd bottle. This product beats Mac Fix + hands down. It ""melds"" my makeup so well. The *only* thing I don't like is the sprayer. I have to transfer it to a different bottle, but given the price? I don't care.",2
"This stuff is amazing...it knocked out me having to buy a primer and spf separately. I hate seeing these crazy people say ""it's not for dry skin"" I use prescription grade skin care so my face peels it gets so dry sometimes. I've never had any issues but maybe it's because I actually properly moisturize first.  This is NOT skin care. it's an spf!!! you have to actually prep people!!!! It actually took away the need for a primer. It makes my makeup last all day. I honestly love it",2
This stuff is amazing! I work 12 hour shifts and my face has a tendency to get super greasy and red. I put this on before I walk out the door for work and I don't have to do anything all night. My face isn't greasy at all and my pores are minimized dramatically.,0
"THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. Long lasting, stays fresh all day, smells amazing, the applicator let's you get a precise application and a little bit goes a long way! I will be getting this stuff every year when its out.",0
"This stuff is awesome! Out of countless creams, serums, and masks at every price point that I've tried over the years to get a handle on the blotchy redness on my face and upper chest, this is the only one that had [nearly immediate] results. Calming indeed! I have lupus with the characteristic ""butterfly"" rash across my cheeks as well as a permanently flushed upper chest, and sun damage hyperpigmentation all over, too. It doesn't seem to be curative (which I hadn't expected), but it does prove to alleviate the redness for at least 8-10 hours. My skin tone is far more even, and my makeup looks fantastic now. It plays well with other skin care and makeup - No pilling or gross texture/residue, nor does it make makeup look cakey. It's very hydrating and no scent. Absorbs nicely. I wish it came in a bigger jar because I use it twice a day, including on my neck and chest. It's not obnoxiously expensive, which is great. Very happy to have finally found something that works - all the others I'd tried were nothing more than ridiculously over priced snake oils.",3
"This stuff is fantastic. In spite of it's full coverage it doesn't weigh my lashes down. It stays put- I like use face oil, and other brands have gradually melted, but somehow this one doesn't move. I have my own natural lashes, but treat them with Latisse, and this mascara serves to deepen their color and allow them to really stand out. The list of mascaras I have tried are as long as my arm, and while I stuck with some of them for a while, the formula would change and it wouldn't work anymore. Hoping this one is around for a while!",2
"This stuff is great! I am ALWAYS leery when using anything new. I have extremely dry skin and I find most everything is too harsh for my delicate skin. I frequently will experience ""fire face"" and end up with a rash if a product is too harsh. Let me tell you, this removes makeup like a champ! It removed the need to use a cloth on my face- which always seems to make my skin angry. I can literally just use my fingers and water-even on eye makeup! This is a Godsend. No more tight and flaking skin for this girl! I still apply moisturizer immediately after I pat my face dry.",4
"This stuff is great. I've been using it for about a year now and my skin has NEVER looked better. This product did take some getting used to. I tried using it every day but my dry skin did not like that at all. Instead I use it every other day and I use a witch hazel toner on the days I don't use this. Really helps with scarring, unclogging pores, and exfoliates dry skin away.",4
This stuff is no joke. I was fearful of looking like a disco ball after application even though a pea size amount was used on face/neck. Woke up the next morning with my skin looking and feeling quite hydrated. It truly does live up to its claims. No fragrance and no gimmicky promises that sound corny. Absolutely in love with this product. First time ever trying Ren and I look forward to exploring more from the line.,2
This stuff is pretty dang amazing. It made my lashes look full and luxurious. No weird mascara smell either. I'm not the hugest fan of larges mascara brushes but this worked pretty well. This mascara lasted all day and survived through my workout. I received this mascara complimentary for testing but I will likely buy in the future.,1
"This stuff is the bomb! I am 56 with good skin but large pores and an oily T zone. I received this as a sample and was skeptical because I thought it would look powdery and settle in my pores and lines. It looked airbrushed! I didn't use a primer, just applied it with a brush over moisturizer I had allowed to settle for an hour or so. The color was spot on, it looked dewy and no annoying settling in my pores. I wore it for 12 hours. It cracked and wore around my nose but I wear glasses so to be expected. But everywhere else it still looked fresh. I shall be purchasing this when my current foundation is done.",3
This stuff might work for you if you are 20 years old with a perfect poreless lineless face. I am not any of those. It sat on my face...like a mask. I usually use a brush to apply and the press in and perfect with a damp sponge. But with this stuff ...I tried several different methods. At the end of it...I still felt like I was wearing a thick rubber mask with a bad herbal smell...what is that gross smell anyways?? I think Charlotte Tilbury is a genius but maybe foundations aren't her gig...I mean I've tried all of them and not impressed. This stuff deserves negative stars. I have had Walmart foundations work better than this,2
"This stuffs amazing, its so gentle I honestly thought it wouldn't do anything. After I use this my skin comes out just like any other exfoliator.. Like it feels smooth and exfoliated lol. But it's so gentle it makes me feel like my skin is safe from micro tears unlike with exfoliators with beads you can feel where they say it's gentle lol this stuff is real gentle. You can make it really diluted and your skin still comes out soft. My new favourite.",1
This stuff seriously keeps my acne under control. It lathers up very nicely. I've been using it for a month and I haven't had any breakouts since then (well only once when I ate a bag of chocolates lol) Highly recommended it!,1
This stuff smells like baby powder. The smell is terrible. I can't even explain it. My father has been in the hospital for months and this scent reminds me of being there. I love Vanilla as another reviewer mentioned it smells like...this does not smell like vanilla. Kind of reminds me of the crap lotion you get in jail also. I can't speak to the hydrating effects because the smell was so offputting.,2
"This sunscreen is fantastic-I use it for when I'm driving on the left side of my face on my way home in the car in case my regular sunblock has worn off, to prevent the discoloration from the sun thru my windows. I noticed I had more sun damage on that side of face than the other. I put on sunblock every day, but I forget to reapply during the day. This stick is convenient, easy to use and smells great. I also use it on my three granddaughters faces as they are allergic to some of the other face sunblocks for kids, they love the smell and that its not white and they don't get any reactions from it. I know its pricey but it works and I'm making sure my granddaughters skin stays as perfect as it is. This is my second purchase of it and will continue to buy it.",3
"This sunscreen is just okay. While it does get the job done, I find that it is chalky and leaves a white cast on my medium tone skin. It also reacts with my moisturizer and causes it to go bad, thus causing breakouts on my face. Note that I have combo skin that's not usually sensitive.",2
"This sunscreen was very oily and greasy on my skin, would not recommend for those with normal or oily skin. The product is also very expensive for the small amount of product. sunscreens are usually at least 1.7 oz of product while this has 1 oz.",4
"this the worst product I've ever used. I thought it had to be something else making my makeup get weirdly cakey, but it is this spray. it melts my makeup off immediately upon the first droplet of sweat, and leaves this cakey, blotchy texture. I am still pretty salty about it -___-",4
"This thing is huge, and is two pieces that you can stack or put beside each other. Plenty of room for a variety of pieces. I like that it doesn't have little individual blocks for lipsticks, so it is more versatile. Drawers on the top part may get a little stuck the first few times you use them but should be fine over time. I like that the top also has one longer section in the back where I can keep brushes and eyeshadow shields. The only thing I would change about the top is the size of the tissue holder. It seems a little small to hold American tissues, but I'm sure when you add more in, it should be fine. The bottom section is awesome, too. it has two large drawers that are perfect for palettes, bronzers, etc. They also come with nice black sheets you lay down to protect the drawers from getting too messy. This even fits my new Norvina Pro Vol. 3 palette with enough room to put another Anastasia palette beside it (and stack another on top). Loving it!",0
"This tiny little tube is the most bright and bold highlighter I've ever used.  Seriously, use this product SUPER sparingly because it is very bold and pigmented and bright! I was honestly very shocked at how small this was until I used this product and I understand why it's so small (it's because you hardly need any).  Use half a grain of rice for your entire face: cheekbones, eyebrow, inner eye (or entire eye), nose, upper lip.  That's all it takes.  If you aren't wanting something super bright and bold for a highlighter, this isn't for you, because it's very strong.  It's also a slightly more glittery highlighter (still shimmery, but slightly more glittery).  I love how strong of a gold this is.  It's not for subtle, no makeup makeup looks.  This is for glam and dramatic looks.  It stays on super well and doesn't flake off and doesn't move around.  My only beef with this product is that it's a bit overpriced, but that's because it's PatMcgrath brand.  I'd say a more reasonable price would be 25$ in my opinion.",0
"This to me is wonderful. Yes, straight out of the fridge. The puffiness is almost instantly reduced. It made my tired eyes (I spend my day at a computer) feel worlds better. Keeping it handy when I am working. Only minor complaint - I wish the amethyst ball was more purple. Mine looks essentially clear like straight quartz. But then again - a rock is a rock and it is still cool and smooth.",3
"This toner definitely gives you a clean feeling once used, however, I didn't see it helping my skin. I have hormonal acne and wanted to use this toner to help the surface area. It didn't help. In fact, it made my chin acne worse and redder. I would reccommend this to someone who doesn't have cystic hormonal acne as it is too harsh for us.",0
This toner has helped clear up my skin! I normally dealt with breakout along my jawline and upper neck that were painful and unsightly. Since adding this toner to my normal routine it's made all the difference. I would seriously recommend to anyone who might have the same concerns but doesn't want to pay an excessive amount of money!,0
this toner is the real deal. it has a tingling cooling feeling and I used this product first when I was looking for a new toner. then later I switched to kiehls but I had to switch back. this origin toner reduced my acne and made me skin feel good. but just make sure you moisturize,0
"This treatment is wonderful stuff! Smooths, brightens, clarifies, tightens...basically everything you want done with your skin. I am already a huge fan of his retinol pads, which are also phenomenal, and was excited that this product delivered impressive results as well. I know it says ""daily,"" but this is a legit peel and I would not use it daily myself...it's pretty strong stuff. I do not have sensitive skin, so I don't know how it would react on it. I have combination, with fine lines and wrinkles and some discoloration. It really improved the tone and texture. Highly recommend!",2
This Trio had the full size moisturizer that I was dying to try and then as a bonus 2 other mini size products. This was great I loved the eye cream and the vitamin C that came with it and now I am ready to purchase the full size for the little freebies that I got to try and fell in love with,1
this trio set is a must have. I did not have a blush and bronzer set for some time and this showed up at the right time. I am so glad I brought it the moment I saw it. packaging was cute. the colors are pigmented.  this set is a part of my everyday make up routine.,4
"This trunk is such a great value. I am running low on all of my skincare so this is a great way to replenish my stash at a discounted price. It doesn't hurt that I purchased this during a rouge 20% off sale too. \n\nThe fridge probably won't fit on my bathroom counter due to my electrical outlet setup, but I can't wait to put some sheet masks and face rollers in there along with some of the Drunk Elephant products. \n\nIf you've never tried DE before, I'd suggest trying a mini kit, but if you're a fan of their products already, buy this!",1
"This *used to be* my favorite product.  it makes my skin feel SO soft!  But that's just it--it makes it feel soft, but it does that by actually destroying your skin's natural water barrier (which is VITAL for keeping your skin moisturized and thus, more youthful looking.) I was so disappointed when I started doing my research to try to disprove this effect (yes, I loved it *that* much!) So, sadly, it has joined my collection of products that don't work, or just don't work for me.  (Even sadder, *that* box is much bigger than the box of products that *do* work) :(\nOh well, off to try to find another HG product.....",3
"This used to be my holygrail and even though it's expensive it was worth the price tag. Recently they changed the formula and it's horrible now. It's no longer moisturizing and dries down within minutes, it pills under makeup, it isn't brightening or helping with lines from dry skin. I got better results from just using my normal face moisturizer instead. skip this, it's bad.",1
"This used to be the best under eye concealer and now the company completely screwed it up! They changed the packaging and most importantly the formula! It does not go on smoothly, it is dry and settles in the fine lines, making skin look brittle and flaky. Plus the new packaging is not hygienic and wastes too much product.  I am so upset.  It was my favorite for years and now I have to look for a replacement.",2
this us totally not worth it. my skin is oily but I've used smashbox primer before and it works just perfectly. I tried this one and my god.. my foundation turned greasy and oily so much after just 1 hour of applying. had to return it to sephora cs it's legit so bad:( not for oily skin for use. save ur money fr.,0
"This version is less smooth and has large chunks of of scratchy glitter with no or little base color and was not flattering at all nor comfortable to wear. 02 Surge Gold seems out of place with the other shades. I wish it was remade toa more refined, sophisticated version of gold because it would have been stunning.",1
"This was a cute pick me up. I applied a thin layer after using a cleansing wipe. At first there was a burning sensation, probably from the residual moisture of the face wipe mixing with the glitter mask. I have a fan and was able to cool myself and look extra at the same time. I left it on for 20 minutes and it was easy to peel off. A few stray sparkles left behind were easy to wipe away. Finished off with a nice cool night cream. My skin feels super soft and looks radiant.",3
"This was a decent powder with nice buildable coverage, but the one thing that set it apart was the 50 SPF. It appears they omitted that from the new formula and the company is marketing a separate sun screen product. Would not buy again because of this.",1
"This was a huge splurge, but I'm not sorry I bought it. The mattes are phenomenal. The shimmers are beautiful too, but you definitely have to do you eyes first. Major fallout from the shimmers. I had the mini already, so I already knew that I loved the formula, and I'm so glad to have the whole palette, but the other duochrome was a bit underwhelming. That said, I enjoy using this palette. It's entirely wearable.",3
"This was an impulse buy -- a super one!  For reference, my skin is on the pale, neutral to olive end of the spectrum but is red/reactive just to throw things off and make finding a good foundation shade difficult.  I'm also older -- so mattes are my friend.  Hooded eyes.  This is the best transition and ""crease"" shade I've ever worn.  It's very understated.  Good color payoff and wear; no fallout.  Love this!",3
This was a real surprise for me. I bought it on impulse and I am so glad I did. The colours all apply very smooth and consistant. They offer great pastels and shimmering glitters. Fallout is minimum and I am so sad this release got lost in the mix. The packaging alone is worth a purchase but the shade range will satisfy anyone.,1
"This was a waste of money,  I didn't see anything change in my skin and I finished the whole bottle. I didn't return it because I wanted to see what happened after I use the whole thing. It didn't do what it claims for my skin.  I am so disappointed. Wish I can get my money back of another bottle sent me me to give it another try . Maybe using it for months longer will have some effect. I would never buy it again tho with my own money unless its given for free . I use their noni face oil and I like that.  I wont say it does everything it claims but it moisturizes my skin and gives it hydration.",1
This was confusing to me at first. I thought it was patchy and didn't blend well. Then I realized that I should be using a lot less. When I started using it more sparingly I fell in love. It applies like a dream and works well on its own for no makeup days or underneath my concealer as a primer and brightener on heavier days. I got the lightest shade and it is lighter than my NC20 skin so it has nice brightening qualities,0
"This was difficult to review because the product is, as always, amazing. Bought this pack to top up my regular purchases but have never tried the toner. It's good and quite strong. I wouldn't want to use it more than once daily. \nI took off one star because the packaging was ridiculous for 4 small products. It was beautiful and nicely designed, but it's way too much. I understand that Glamglow wants to market itself as a high end product with packaging to help it's image. I felt embarrassed to immediately chuck the box into my recycling bin.",1
"This was my favorite moisturizer. This had been the most reliable moisturizer for over a year. Now with the formula change, I'm having breakouts & greasy skin. So very disappointment with the brand. Now I'm on lookout for a new one",2
"This was my first good brush, and it turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks. I love this brush, and it’s such a relief to skip searching my face for errant brush hairs every time I powder. I don’t recall the price of this brush, but it’s worth it!",3
"This was my first Natasha Denona purchase and was so good it actually made me pick up your full Gold palette. The mattes are great and easy to work with - pigmented, not patchy, not prone to fallout. \n\nThe dark brown satin really balances the color scheme and keeps it from being too green, it also makes a great smokey eye. It applies best with fingers, but it also works fine with a brush, just takes a little longer to get the full effect.\n\nThe metallics are absolutely beautiful. Both go on easily with brushes or fingers. The green has a duochrome to it, and it's the more subtle of the two - the finish is closer to satin without too much flashback. The gold is a showstopper! I find it applies best patted on gently (no swiping), so you retain the texture. \n\nOverall I'm very happy I gave this a shot as it's quickly become one of my favorite little palettes.",1
"This was my first night mask that was for correcting uneven skin tone which really just appeared in the last 3 or 4 years, I'm 48 now. I was so happy I chose this one, it is amazing!! Does exactly what it says. At first I put too much on, you really don't need alot. If you put too much on its oily and goopy feeling. But when you do it right it will absorb into your skin and I saw results literally the next morning. My face was brighter, I looked awake, alive lol. I know its a continued use thing though. If I go a week or so without using my blotches come back. If there was something that was permanent that would be incredible but then they wouldn't have repeat buyers....",3
"This was my first time trying a brush like this. I was skeptical when the associate used on me, but I really, really like it.\nI have never really liked using my fingers for concealer and I think this brush does a better job than a beauty blender.\n\nAnd it was a reasonable price.\n\nHighly recommend",4
"This was my second lip balm from Tom Ford, and it sealed my disappointment for their lip product forever. Its moisturization last less than 30 minutes, and the pigment is too overwhelming and vivid at first swipe, making it impossible for buildable reapplication, which is not something I'd want in a lip balm. Big, big waste of money.",4
"This was nice at the beginning, but then it started drying out my lips. My lips became incredibly dry, peeling, cracked, and painful. Can you damage your moisture barrier on your lips? That is what it felt like. Took me over a week of no lipstick and just putting petroleum jelly on my lips constantly to get them back to normal. Horrible.",2
"This was recommended by Good Housekeeping as its number one pick of eye creams. I use Absolue face and never thought I really needed to spend so much for eyes. Well, I gave it a try and--Wow!  this cream is fabulous!  Very hydrating, and the hydration lasts and lasts.  I use it on top of the Murad renewal eye serum (also recommended by GH) and I really see a difference in my eyes.  I look rested; my eyes are brighter and more toned.  still have dark circles but I don't expect any product to diminish them.  This is worth the splurge--trust me.",2
This was recommended to me by one of the sephora employees when I was looking for a new concealer. I have never written a bad review before but this was so bad. It doesnt cover or blend. It took multiple tries to get anything to appear and by then it had removed my foundation. If you want a great concealer I would recommend Huda's. Dont waste your money or time on this concealer.,1
this was so disappointing...streaky and little to no coverage coupled with it looking like I had nothing on my face after a few hours...so patchy and over all crap!! too bad...made my face do this >> :(,3
"This was the first kind of brush I learned to apply gel and cake eyeliner with. For some odd reason I'll start using an angle brush, then go back to the bent brush. There's so much more control and precision available with the bent brush.",3
"This was the first primer I used, and I was amazed that the condition of my eyelashes improved as well. When coming to the end of my second tube, I was convinced to try another brand ... How did that go? I'm ordering my third tube!!",4
"this was the most beautiful, glow-from-within, glowing primer I've ever used. I've tried some other primers that have a pearlescent glow,  but on my Asian skin, it never looked quite natural. This was a serious game changer, and photos made me look so radiant! I dont think this will be my every day primer, but I'm so tempted just to go big everyday! I hate the words, ""holy grail,"" but, holy crap I'm glowing.",4
"This was very drying on my lips and had a gritty feel to it when worn alone. I do not mind glitter, but this was more than I expected. Someone had mentioned this had a sandpaper feel, and I agree. \n\nWhen I tried it over a lip treatment it wasn't too bad, but I will be returning.",3
this whole  palette  is beautiful its usually  difficult to find bronzers and contours that work well for my skin tone but this does i find that it's a very  stiff product  but i personally  enjoy  that because  it makes overdoing  it very difficult,0
"This wonderful mist just feels so clean. On mornings that I exfoliate, a few sprays of this is so comforting. On mornings I simply splash water on my face, this is a refreshing pick me up. It never feels oily and does not sting. I received a complimentary sample in exchange for an honest review, I say without hesitation that I will purchase this product when the complimentary bottle runs out.",2
"this works great! it's so easy to use, its gorgeous colors, I haven't had any problems with creasing even without a primer, and HOLY COW the matte side would last for days if you didnt remove it!(my initial hand swatch lasted almost 2 days before I scrubbed it off)",4
"This works! I’ve tried several highly rated eye lifting products and this one works amazingly. Goes on and absorbs nicely, I use any excess above my upper lip to smooth vertical lines. It is fantastic!",2
This would get 5 stars but one of the pans looks like it might crumble.  Cpuld have happened during shipping.  Also there are not really any mattes in this.  Every shade has a slight shimmer.  Not a fan of that.  Otherwise the colors are really beautiful,3
"This would have been an amazing go to lipstick based on the smooth formula and amazing pigmentation, but unfortunately the colour on the models are deceiving. I ordered the shade ""she's confident"" hoping for a deep brown shade, the colour was more orange and looks very unappealing with tan skin. Hoping the other shades will match a little bit better.",1
"Tinted lip balms are really having their moment (Thank God!) so the bar is high for any new product.  Achieving the ""your lips just better"" PLUS serious hydration is holy grail-ish. Honestly, this is just a very sheer lipstick. It's totally fine, Berry is a flattering shade - just nuttin' special :(",3
"Tldr all the comments about this device rusting thru and breaking within a few months are legit.\n\nBut even when it worked, it was nothing like the clarisonic. That gives me results, the fofo just doesn't. \n\nI bought this at the end of June to use while traveling, visiting family, etc. I used it almost every weekend until it died in early September. It lived in a dry travel bag. I thought maybe the battery died. opened it up, noticed the screws were rusted. Rusty water, batteries, and backing came out of the device. I looked online, found lots of similar reviews. So I contacted the company to let them know, ""oh that never happens, but send us pictures and we'll replace it"". I just returned it.",4
"To begin with, I'm a mask junkie. What this mask does to minimize pores is amazing. It has a kind of medicinal smell, which I kind of like. It just smells like it's working. A little goes a long way too!",3
To be honest I haven't really noticed anything with this serum. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks so maybe I should give it a couple more weeks before I make a final decision. But based on the two weeks I would say save your $72. I received the product free or complimentary for sampling purposes,2
"Too expensive. I've tried many other charcoal cold process soap bars and they all work just as well as this for half the price. I can buy 6-8oz bars for $7 from local markets and even grocery stores that work as well if not better. 4oz for $12 + shipping from Sephora is a huge margin you shouldn't be paying for. I used the entire bar up on my face/back for acne. It leaves a very slimy texture (possibly due to excessively hard water) and takes a while to wash all the residue off. 2 stars for the price, 3 stars for a soap doing what any other soap does.",1
"Took a chance since it was on sale. Works perfectly to tone down brow pencils that are too cool toned or dark for me, I am golden blonde,  I got the color LIGHT and it makes my brows the perfect color over those endless unusable darker pencils I receive in my beauty boxes. Loving this!",3
took me some time to figure out how to best use it for my skin. overnight does not work best for me. it does seem to clog my pores and I have lint stuck all over my face which I'm sure also means dirt. not their fault I have kitties! I love to put it on when I have a lazy morning and can take about half and hour to and hour to chill and do things around the house. my face is SO GLOWY the rest of the day and it definitely seems to help my breakouts chill. hydrating without being greasy. win!,4
"Too Thick for me....I have extremely dry skin and thought this would be a treat for my skin. It is way to thick and does not absorb into skin. Additionally,  it broke be out in huge painful bumps and I haven't had acne since high school.  It took 2 weeks with my previous brand to clear my skin up.",2
"To preface, I have oily skin with spots of hyperpigmentation and melasma, and I prefer full coverage matte or natural finish foundation. When I use this foundation as directed (moisturizing a bit more with no primer and no setting powder/spray) I loathe this. My pores look huge and the wear time is awful. However, if I use this as a standard foundation with primed skin and finished with a tiny bit of powder and some spray to ""melt"", the experience is a LOT better. A little *does* go a long way (I don't have to use concealer with this foundation, which NEVER happens for me!) but I still need a full pump. Frankly, even using the Hourglass foundation brush and working quickly in small sections, I wasn't able to even completely coat my face let alone cover everything with a half pump. My advice: treat this like any other heavy coverage matte foundation and you'll likely enjoy the results. Oh, and bonus: this transfers the least of any foundation I've ever tried. It's so nice to be able to wear a turtleneck with confidence...",4
"To sum up this product: it’s extremely high coverage, it goes on very dry, it doesn’t last all day unfortunately especially around the nose area, and it transfers onto clothing horribly almost as badly as if you had powder sitting on top of your face",0
"Totally impressed with this line. I have spent a small fortune on products for my hyper sensitive acne prone skin over the years, and this line provides better results than anything I have ever used. These pads exfoliate without irritation, which in itself is a miracle for my skin. Sephora should create a starter box, a few ads on TV, and ProA..... would be out of business. How I wish I had these in my teen years. Thank you Sephora!!!",4
Tried all the fancy mascaras. Most of them are not suitable for my eyes. My eyes can be sensitive.  I do not get nasty clumps with this.At the end of the day this product does NOT rub off into little crumbs all over my face. I absolutely love that this comes with the primer as well. This is absolutely my favorite mascara. As long as this is being made I will keep repurchasing this mascara. It is easy to remove and I do not end up with raccoon eyes after washing off.,2
"Tried it as a free sample, and I was really impressed with how it performed.  I have older skin, some wrinkles, and it did not settle in lines.  I use a serum underneath and it lays very nicely.  Anything that can perform through Florida heat and humidity and relentless hotflashes gets 5 stars from me.  And no one does foundation colors for pale skin like Shiseido - probably being a Japanese co., they are more geared towards the nuances of fairer skin.",4
Tried this based on a recommendation. I love Fresh products and they usually don't disappoint. The smell was strong but not bad. I have dry skin and this just wasn't thick enough for winter night cream. bummer.,2
"Tried this concealer and it is a good concealer. I covered my dark old pimples that was healing and it hid it very well. Pretty much covered everything I needed to look flawless. It lasted long and nice color. I didn't have a problem with my concealer wearing off. I threw a party and I wore it from 12pm till 5am! Yep you heard that right! I ran errands all day too! Yes it is a good concealer, I recommend it. Might be a pricier  concealer but it is honestly a good quality concealer.",1
Tried this on a whim! I'm now in love with this! Makes you feel like you went to the Spa!! I'm finding more and more that I love Ren Skincare and I'm loving the body products. This is heaven!! Will be purchasing this again and again lol!!,3
"Tried this one and was not impressed.  While the color was fantastic in terms of intensity and staying power, I found it difficult to manipulate.  It's described as a gel, but I find it more of a paste and not a gooey one, either.  It was too thick to draw a sharp fine line.  It's easy to remove with basic remover and that's about it.  The packaging was different, but because the container is dark and the product is dark, it was not easy to see how far to dip the brush into the container.  I returned the product.",3
"Tried this today, followed directions on package. Upon removal-I felt a film on my face (maybe wonderglow primer?) and noticed the ""glow"" which is pink on a few areas of my face. My guess is, the ""massage"" portion of applications is to transfer the pink off the sheet onto your face. I had to buff my skin with a soft brush to even out ""the glow"" This did not lift anything at all. Overpriced for what it does and will not purchase again.",3
"Truly great dewy skin compact option, especially versus the powdery kind of compact. It's a perfectly light coverage, great for day to day & for along the way touch ups, its nicely tinted, well done, moisturizing but not oily, & gives you sun protection. It's a K beauty style related brand, so the concept being with use of cutting edge skincare, it's part of an idea of having such perfect skin you wear minimal but very flattering makeup. as if you're not wearing any or to give an enhanced natural look. It's subtle but adds that little extra je ne sais quoi to give your skin even color, even texture, blurred pores and subtle luminosity. Also, It came with one back up spongey product refill to switch out of the reusable compact when required.",1
two of mine were covered in a dusty white powder. I dont know if its vecause they were old or just the formula but it did wipe of so it was just a small layer on them. love the color and feel of the one that I felt safe to use tho.,0
Two stars because it did remove my makeup and didn't irritate my eyes. It is VERY oily and thick. Doesn't emulsify very well. Difficult to remove even with my toughest face wash. I don't need oils blocking my serums and moisturizer. I did get this as a sample but would not buy or recommend.,1
"Two stars. I originally should have purchased the regular one the ""foundation primer"" , however I bought this with radiance by mistake. I tried this several times. Let me explain what's wrong with this product. 1. It has COLOR! Be cautious with this. It says ""radiance"" so it actually a champagne shimmering light-cream. It's somewhat similar to Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter if you know that one. However this one just has one color option, which means, it only fits light-medium skin color. If you are very fair, or if you are medium-dark, this probably shows a wrong color on your skin. Think twice.  2. It's thick! It applies as thick as a tinted moisturizer, with a little coverage. Therefore it means, if you are that type prefer a heavy makeup look, with full coverage foundation, you probably feel Okay adding this layer beneath your foundation. However, if you are like me for a more natural sheer look, using a light coverage foundation, this is NOT for you! This gonna add an extra layer under your foundation making your foundation look thick and less flattering than it's supposed to. 3. I tried to use it as a tined moisturizer, since it really looks like a tinted moisturizer with my color shade and with radiance. However, it doesn't have lasting power it will go dim and orange quickly. So, it ends up being not useful at all. Attached you see what it shows on my skin. I'm light-medium neutral during summer. Yes it shows a pretty shimmer. It definitely has color and isn't good for fair or dark skin. You see that? I hope this review helpful for you. If you looking for a lightweight transparent hydrating primer, go for the LM ""foundation primer"", not the hydrating one, not the radiance one, not the oil-free one. Just go for the original formula.",1
"Typically I wait at least 7 days after 1st trying a new product to write a review. I like to give the product some time to do what it should start doing. This is the exception to the rule. Alot of the time I see or watch people talk about how their moisturizer feels so luxurious that they feel it the moment it gets applied and remains that way when they wake up. I was in a constant search for that same feeling and somehow never found it...until now. The night I first tried on this product, it felt like butter on my face. The next day, my face still felt so soft. After cleansing, I put it on in the morning and after a day's work, my face still felt incredibly hydrated. The best part, it's light and not heavy on my face at all. Here's hoping the price remains relatively the same.",4
"Ugh! fallout ridiculous, I look like a clown. \n\nI really wanted to love this palette, since I found it discounted. \n\nAs everyone says, the case itself is huge and unwieldy; the giant sequins make it look suitable for a 12-YO; the other stuff in the box is not that usable (mascara barely noticeable until you get raccoon eyes within the hr); the brush doesn't pick up the pigments; there is HUGE FALLOUT- I use a primer and fixer, and I have no clue how anyone else actually USES this palette. \n\nSO disappointing. And clunky. And unusable, frankly.  (Fans- please explain.)",2
"Ugh. I had high hopes for this as a fair skinned person who has been looking for the right self tanner for years. I used it twice and had trouble both times: patchy, streaky, orange. The bottle is also very difficult to spray and cannot be used upside down! How do they expect people to spray this on themselves? Will be returning...",0
"Ultimately, you can cut up hydrocolloid bandages or buy the ones by 3M or Bandaid and they'll do the same thing for your acne for about a quarter of the price. I wanted to love these, but they're just not worth it.",2
Ummm this is stunning.  I do have to agree with other reviewers on the fact that this is not a true to tone cool palette. I would say it leans cool on the neutral side of things. Just like the mini nude is very warm and not neutral by any means. The mini glam is kind of the same thing. Neutral with cool under tones but definitely not straight up cool toned. The formula is just what you would expect from Natasha Denona. Its lovely. I don't regret my purchase.,2
"Unfortunately I don't have luck with retinol.  It dries out my skin and makes wrinkles increase .  I read about this product as the more natural, gentle, version so decided to give it a try.  Purple is also my favorite color.  Unfortunately it produced the same results as retinol.  My skin became parched and my wrinkles multiplied so I had to return.",4
"Unfortunately my skin did not respond well to this primer. I refuse to give it a one star, given that smashbox has never done anything but make me smile (instead of wanting to literally smash the box). I have blemishes which need a stronger, thicker primer than this one but it is all a matter of perspective.",4
Unfortunately on me this is just a skin care product. It does nothing to improve the look of my face or the wear of my makeup on my oily skin. For some reason this kind of made my makeup look cakey too.,2
"Unfortunately, this is THE worst lip gloss I've ever tried. I've been following this brand for months & have been wanting to try them! I saw the gloss was on sale & decided to pick it up. I got the shade Nympho. I wear A LOT of duo-chrome glosses with pink/blue/lavender glitter & this one missed the mark. It's SOO thick that the white base shows up no matter what. This is usually not an issue with my duo-chrome glosses, not even the cheap ones. \n\nIt feels more like spackle than a gloss. I tried to sheer it out but the applicator is too flimsy to move the product around. You're left with a white gummy look that immediately builds up in the inner part of the lips \n\nI'd never recommended this.",4
"Unfortunately this product did not work on me. I've heard many great reviews that it worked on oily, acne prone skin. This oil irritated my skin and acne. I'll try other oils but this one is a skip for me.",0
"unfortunately this product has not worked for me, I haven't noticed any difference. it also has a weird smell to it which a lot of Lancome stuff has the same smell and I can't stand it. I recieved this as a complimentary gift.",1
"Unfortunately when Tatcha decided to reintroduce this product they also messed with the formula, adding an oil to supposedly make it more moisturizing. Well, I had the opportunity to compare them side by side and all they did was make it stickier and LESS moisturizing. The old mask melted on contact with your liips; it was like a sheet mask for the lips. This new version is much thicker and sits on top of the lips rather than sinking in. It pains me to say it but Tatcha took an exquisite  product and turned it into an average lip mask.",4
"Universal Earth (708) is the best match for a nautral lip liner I've found in a while since my perfect one from Essence was discontinued. So if you have NC42-45ish olive skin tone with mauve-y lips, try this one out! It's got a good bit of brown in it so it doesn't give you the dead lips look. The texture of the lip liner could be better, I generally prefer one that is a little waxier but it's still very good! And I love the face that it works well on cheeks and eyes too.",0
"Unlike regular concealers, this contains salicylic acid to help calm and fight the enemy pimple. Apart from that, it's also got skin purifying ingredients such as kaolin clay, zinc and sulfur. Some of these ingredients can be found in pimple drying products such as the Mario Badescu drying lotion, but you can't wear that under makeup. \n\nThis concealer is super full coverage! I was actually very surprised. Usually when you put a lot of skincare ingredients into a makeup product, it dilutes the pigmentation. Not so in this case, and it was also very easy to blend. \n\nI wear makeup to work everyday, so there's no avoiding that. And I did notice that my breakouts would look less inflamed at end of the day when I took my makeup off while wearing this product. And it cleared up a lot faster, but still not fast enough . \n\nI received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest feedback.",4
"Unreal. This product actually reallu surprised me. I bought it on a whim because the watermelon Glow Recipe products have always called my name, but they are a little pricey. This product has actually gotten rid of some of my accutane dryness and has made makeup application more possible. It also smells amazing and gives a beautiful glow. Also, the mist is so fine and lovely. It doesn't make you wet at all. Although expensive, in my opinion this is worth the price.",0
Urban Decay is always my top choice for eyeshadow. I received this as a gift and absolutely adore the colors especially when paired in sultry combinations. I originally thought I wouldn't use this pallette very much but have learned that the colors are very versatile.,1
"Used it on it's own after washing my face. Left it on for a couple hours and washed off. At the end of the day I noticed I broke out in tiny pimples in various places including spots I normally don't break out in like my forehead. I don't have sensitive skin,  so buyer beware.",4
"Used these for 2 consecutive nights on 2 pimples that popped up overnight.  I'm 45 & having acne that I never suffered in high school. But these patches didn't seem to do much at all.  The slight punch on application was reassuring--that it was really getting that medicine here it needed to be.  When I took them off in the morning, they hadn't gotten better, but, to be fair, they hadn't gotten worse, either.  However, I feel like Neutrogenia's Light Therapy blemish spot wand is far more effective (note: it works best on light skin and in this matter at least, I'm thankful I'm very fair) and much cheaper ($20 purchase for unlimited use with the occasional battery change).",3
"Used this for about 3 months just at night and almost every night and in the morning every once in a while. I have literally no difference in my skin. I'll probably just give the half bottle to a friend, it's not even worth finishing when there are better products out there.\n2 stars because the texture was decent for layering products and it didnt mess up makeup application when I used it in the morning.",1
"Used this for about a week and a half. It absorbs 3x as much product as my sephora pro sponge. 3rd or 4th time cleaning it, it popped like a pimple. A bunch of foundation came out and now it has 2 big holes in the bottom.",2
"used this religiously for a month. it's very nicely priced as it's a huge container for an eye cream. however, every time i put it on, it wouldn't sink in well, and it would temporarily make my dark circles look WORSE. i didn't notice any long term difference with this product and i honestly recommend to just save your money up to by a better eye cream ( my favorites including caffeine, per my dermatologist's input)",2
"Used to be my favorite of all lipsticks until they changed the formula, still love the color Gipsy - however will not be repurchasing the new formula is too greasy and doesn't stay on very well.  Sad when the change what was a excellent product.",3
"Usually don't write reviews but this mascara deserves one! Been in search of replacement since Shu Uemura discontinued my fav Natural (first edition) then Stretch Extreme. I have straight, short-ish lashes and have hard time holding curl w most masc (after curling). Tried Diorshow, Marc Jacobs Velvet, Nars Climax, Benefit Badgal & They're Real, Too Faced Better than Sex, Urban Decay Perversion and Cannonball (Cannon light formula so least option for me/holds curl but doesn't build much volume). This mascara somehow builds tons of thickening volume and length -- super dark lashes that are jet black, full, long and holds the curl!!! Ppl have thought I was wearing false eyelashes. LOVE THIS MASCARA!",3
"Usually I use milk of magnesia as a matte primer for my oily face. Then, an employee recommended me this product. I asked for a sample and was very satisfied with the results that I decided to return to purchase a bottle!",1
"Usually love Nars but very disappointed with this.  Tried several different types of brushes and just couldn’t pick up color! Weird.  I have Orgasm blush and love it, but the formulation for this mini mist be different. Even after many swipes with brush could see virtually no color, and the bronzer was even wose.  Sent it back.",3
"Usually when I see “radiant concealer” I think “not heavy enough for my dark circles.” But this was great! No need to double dip, one time covered all my problem spots. For a heavier coverage, I did go in again under my eyes, but \t definitely felt one time was fine for every day makeup. I combined this with one pump of their foundation and felt like I had perfect coverage and a natural look. Not that cakey look you can get from heavy concealers. I will agree with other reviews. The shades are MUCH darker in person. Take the photo and figure two shades darker. Thankfully, I chose a color that would be good for highlighting, so this one still matches my skin/foundation fine.",0
"Velour Lashes, I've never tried before. I have had bad luck with the thick bands on lashes in the past due to the bands being too stiff to form the shape of my eye long enough for the glue to set. (I'm petite so maybe my eyeballs are smaller???) \nI decided to give these a go anyway, I got the Sassy but Classy set. They are awesome!!! I like the shape of them, they seem to fit my eye better... the curve of the lash band. This set is beautiful, not overdone for daily wear. Durable, totally worth it!",2
"Velvet Noir is one of my top five favorite mascaras. It gives a very thick voluminous effect. Almost clumpy, but in a good way! sometimes a girl wants a bit of a clumpy lash! It's a great mascara if you have tiny, straight, thin and practically non existent lashes like I do. It holds a curl all day and doesn't flake on me and works for both my top and bottom lashes  And although I do prefer something with a smaller wand for my lower lashes, it works fine in a pinch. This little holiday kit comes with a sample of the lash primer. And while I do enjoy the primer, I actually don't feel I need it with this particular mascara, because, the mascara is deadly enough on its own. But it does work great, to prime the lashes and add thickness, I just use it with a thinner formula mascara. Anyway, the mascara is expensive but I think it is worth it. Not sure I would pay full price for the primer, as I have used more affordable ones that work just as good.",2
"Very concentrated pigment in universally flattering colors. I did have to watch her youtube video on how to use all 5 at once (apparently I'm an eyeshadow dunce), but got loads of compliments on that look. You can also go much lighter for daily wear.",1
"Very confused by the rave reviews considering it was useless for my oily skin. It has a watery texture and actually made me even oiler than usual, rather than controlling my oil. It was out of control - had to unfortunately return.",1
"Very cute little lip balms. The two color ones applied smoothly and were glossy. Wear time is zero however. Wore off after maybe 30 minutes. The clear balm was moisturizing, that being said-no way worth the price for the single full sizes of these. I am enjoying the mini's but will not be purchasing full size of any of them as they are Way overpriced.",3
"Very disappointed, the shadows are a pain in the butt to transfer from brush to eyelid not very pigmented very cheap quality I'm guessing they rushed this palette also the colors look way different in person than they do in the pictures",2
"Very disappointing. I love sol de janeiro's products so much, I feel like they're always so high quality...but wow this product was terrible. It stained my skin yellow and left a pale yellow tint all over my tub/shower.  It took so much to get the stain off of my tub and the next time I shaved my legs, my shaving cream was turning yellow from the product coming off my skin.",1
"Very drying. I like the reg face oil (bought the mini size that came with the soap) and went to purchase the full size and Sephora no longer carries this. I've found this is often the case when purchasing promotional items or receiving samples that the product is no longer available at Sephora and I wind up purchasing elsewhere what I've sampled here. Anyway, this stuff is very drying and may be good for someone with very oily skin.",4
Very impressed! I own a lot of Pat McGrath products already so I was interested to see how these would stack up. I got the subversive one and it has not disappointed. The gold is so gorgeous and I experienced minimal - no fall out.,3
"very impressed with the variety and quantity! I love the SDJ bum bum cream, the Biossance oil, the snow mushroom serum, and the youth to the people face mask! the samples are generously sized in my opinion",4
"Very light gel-like formula that smells like a sweet almond, almost. Unfortunately the formula doesn't tend to sink into your skin well, so it leaves your skin always a bit tacky, leading to a constant pulling sensation whenever your skin touches anything.\n\nAs for formula effectiveness, I would not say this performs better than more direct ascorbic acid formulations.",0
"Very luxurious feeling, just like the foundation. Not really all that special. It does have a good finish but I just wish it set matte. The color is slightly too olive for my liking. Its not bad, but I wouldn't run out to buy it.",4
"Very Matt finish. Easy application, very smoother. I was looking for a high spf to replace my Skinceuticals sunscreen that is just too  oily under my foundation. This product did the trick! I was outside in fire t sunshine all day this week and I'm the only one with no sunburn!\nLove Shiseido's innovative products and unique packaging. This sunscreen is a winner!",3
Very minimal is needed when using because it really spreads but after the initial application my face felt dry. It really did nothing for me and left my face just a tad bit tacky. \n\nThe facial wash is bomb though!,0
Very moisturizing and long lasting lip color! No need for lip balm prior to application because the formula is sufficiently hydrating and smooth. It also lasts through drinking hot or cold beverages with little transfer. There is a sharpener at the end of the pencil to keep lip crayon sharp. Hot weather makes it soft so keep this in mind when travelling with the lip crayon. I enjoy wearing it!,3
"Very nice light weight, medium coverage. I love the added bonus of the concealer. I don’t find the concealer is as good as my It Cosmetics one, but it is nice and silky. I find it a little difficult to just get a small amount with the pump dispenser.  I also find the packaging bulky for travelling,\nOverall a nice product.",3
"Very nice lip mask. it smells and tastes like cotton candy, if you put it at night, you will wake up with your lips plumped and very soft. however I don't think this should be $25 the container is plastic, looks great but it's not like the jelly highlighters. also this doesn't compare to the laneige lip mask which is the best!!\njust a very nice product to have if you love lip balms and masks.",0
"Very nice! Picture is only one coat. Didn't go overboard as there was no need, I got the look I wanted from just the 1. My lashes are sparse and this gave me the exact look I wanted. Perfect for day time...",3
"Very pigmented and fun to play with. Not dusty at all,easy to work with. The only shade I didn't like is Eternal light. The glitter in it is too chunky. Zero gravity shade works great as a crease shade as well as brow filler. Used this wonderful pallete to create a brunette version of Harley Quinn on picture below;)",1
"Very pretty.  If you’re not familiar with cream blush this may be tricky.  I put this on right after primer, under my foundation.  I’m 57 y.o., therefore do not use as much concealer on my under eye, nose, and face as younger people do, so it’s got a sheer coat over it.  I then follow up with a bounce blush.  It gives a very natural tint that way.  I don’t care much for the package design, as it can be messy.  There is a cardboard type lid on it with a foil seal that I leave in the cap for extra sealing purposes.",3
"Very pretty! I loved each color and really loved the ease of application. My skin looked so pretty for once. Colors are buildable and this palette features the first ever bronzer that worked for my skin! I've never been able to wear any before as they all looked terrible or super obvious and wouldn't blend. This one, one little swoosh and boom bam done. The highlighter looks SUPER natural, but it IS also buildable for those who wanna take it from day to night real quick. \nThe only downfall is that I didn't find it had much staying power, compared to the blushes I'm used to wearing everyday, even with a primer and setting spray I found I had to reapply. Not that difficult, considering how easily transportable this palette is. Takes up much less room than it would if I had to cart around each product individually. After hmm'ing about buying this, I'm so glad I finally got it. Overall I'm happy with my purchase!",1
"very soothing. helps retain moisture and makes my skin quite soft. it is super important to use it -as directed-. the first time I used it I was left with a sticky mess. but warming up a few drops in my hands and gently pressing into my skin after toner makes my skin feel nice and calm. doesn't conflict with other skincare products, works well under makeup, and I have absolutely no negative reaction to it. it is definitely safe to use, even when my skin is going nuts.so far haven't seen any improvement on fine lines or wrinkles but it's only been a month. maybe by the time I finish the bottle? although at the rate I'm using the product that may be awhile. you definitely get your money's worth.",4
Very surprise !! This is a very full Cover age foundation !! But I choose color #22 and when I received it I was disappointed !! It was more beige that the color see on the color selection .... So I dont really use it because it does not suit my complexion... ☹️,3
"Very unique eye shadow toppers. Apply any eyeshadows or in correspondence with the eye topper you want to wear and it gives you a beautiful pop of color. Can be used as highliters on your face as well, the pink is the best.",1
Very wearable and easy to build up. For those who are having trouble with coverage maybe try a glitter glue and patting the product on. I've havn't had any trouble with them though and the colors are beautiful.,0
"Wanted a powder spf to also act as a powder if my skin gets oily. As the previous reviews mentioned, the packaging just encourages a mess and wasting product. Once you take out the nozzel located within the brush which dispenses the product, it never closes.",2
"Wanted to love it but this product looks so cakey on me. It creases and no matter how I apply it, it looks like I have a lot of makeup on and then ends up sitting on creases. I have tried many ways to get it to work.  It rubs off easily, too. It works a bit better with primer and setting powder, but other foundations work better for me. I do have combination/oily skin. Strange because the free sample looked good but when I bought the full size, after daily use, I grew to hate it.",2
"Wanted to love it..tried it during a perk facial and really loved the warming feeling.  BUT, after enough uses I realized that it broke me out with large papules.  Also, as others have stated, hard to get out of the tube.",0
"Was excited to try this as the skin care / hydrating aspects appealed to me. My existing daily foundation is Estee Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-place, and sometimes its a bit dry. Was initially pleased as the lightest shade was actually a match (which is often not the case as I'm so fair). It started promising. With the first application I went about my routine as normal, which includes the Tarte Poreless primer, applied the foundation with the brush as recommended and lightly powdered. My entire face looked dry and cakey. I immediately washed it off and tried again, using my beauty sponge and only using light powder under my eyes, bit on my chin and nose. However, within the first hour I could see pores I don't normally see... such as between my eye brows and above my lip. The foundation appeared to sit around the pores, emphasizing them (despite using primer). The foundation felt as though it was SITTING ON my face, rather than blended well with my skin. If you touched anywhere or bumped it on clothing, the foundation came completely off. It was also patchy. I have difficulty finding foundations that work well with my skin, but this has to be the worst one. (fully un-edited pic attached).",0
was hoping this oil-enriched cream would be my winter skin saviour but does not have the penetrating power I was hoping for. just sits on top of skin and contributed to my first breakout in years. will not keep this product.,2
was looking to replace my witch hazel because its so drying. glad i purchased this. i personally love the smell. and it leaves my skin feeling amazing. ive only used it a week and my skin was freaking out but i think this has calmed it down quite a bit.,1
"Was my favorite all-in-one lip product, but now they’ve reformulated this and it no longer has avobenzone for UVA protection (the ones that cause lip aging). I’ll have to go find something else-so upset because I loved this!!",2
"Was really hoping to like this because of the glow, but it doesn’t last long and it creases horribly. I tried using primers and everything and it still creased. After a couple hours of wear the glow is gone and it’s just a pigmented crease.",0
Was recommended to this product after I needed a step up from my origins eye doctor...went to bed with purplish dry eyelids and peeling skin ..woke up with better eyes than my baseline...can't wait to see what this does in the long term!,4
"was skeptical at first but the bubbles r magic! can be a bit tricky to apply, dry hands r needed to apply and remove but u can see a difference right away. I dont find myself using more than once a week.",2
"Was surprised about the negative reviews. Switched from benefit eye cream to this and won't go back. Love the applicator. Love the cooling feel (benefit left a tingling sensation I didn't like) I'm super sensitive to purfume smells, and alot of people say this is strong. I cannot smell anything. I even smelt the applicator and cannot smell a thing. Maybe there has been a formula change recently and they removed it.  I feel I look less tired. It's a win for me.",2
"Waste of money and time. I get they're supposed to be gentle, but they failed even in that regard. These pads made my redness on cheeks worse while failing to actually exfoliate or do anything. The next day my face was the same, maybe a little worse looking. A complete fail. Save your money and find an alternative.",0
"Waste. Of. Money. I’m very disappointed in this product. I knew when I bought it that it was a “conditioner” and not a lipstick, but this is ridiculous. Within 5 minutes of application, the color has migrated to the edges of my lips. Heaven help me if I talk or drink or eat because then it’s gone completely. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it’s a pretty color.",3
"Was very excited to finally try this wonder creme. Boo hoo. Could not get it warmed between my fingers to translucency no matter how I tried - and then I started to wonder why I should have to do this? Why am I moisturizing my fingers instead of my face? Was extremely thick to apply. Took overnight to absorb - or perhaps just rubbed off on my pillowcase? Gifted this to my sis who is a fan, and went back to my beloved Dior. All is well in the kingdom now.",3
"Was weary at first application as it appeared orangey but that immediately went away and melted into my skin. I didnt use a moisturizer beforehand and im combo skin for reference. This feels like cool water and smells delicious on your face (light and clean) evens out skin, gives light moisture, slightly buildable coverage and definitely a nice glow without being shiny or sparkly. Only downside is my t-zone does get oily mid-day however this is not a matte foundation so thats fine, i bought it for light coverage of my redness, acne, and fine lines and it does just that. use a matte primer if desired. overall love this",0
"Waterproof mascara is usually notorious for keeping lashes curled. The size of the brush would be fine for longer lashes because the bristles would have something to catch on. However, if you are cursed with nonexistent lashes like I am, you just get product all over the place. The formula is not great either because even after cleaning off the flecks, my under eyes always get smudged within an hour, whether or not I apply concealer and powder.",2
"WAY too liquidy, WAY too pigmented, it gets everywhere and will ruin a perfectly good brow day. I was so excited when I got this because I thought the formula would be similar to the Kush mascara... Not even close. I've tried and tried with this product but it's time to return it. I even tried taking excess product off on the back of my hand and it STILL managed to get everywhere. It doesn't even bulk up the brow hair, just gets smears of overly pigmented product on the skin. If I could give it zero stars I would.",4
"We all know there is no magic bullet for tiny wrinkles under the eyes. I personally have tried over a dozen eye creams and gels with little or no results. I tried a sample before pulling the trigger and spending $60 . I have to say that the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex does a great job of moisturizing the area under my eyes and making the tiny fine lines diminish. I use the gel every night before bed. This is the best I have tried. When I wake up my eyes don't look tired and the tiny lines are not as visible. I just hope Estee Lauder doesn't discontinue the product. This happens often when you find a product you love, it suddenly goes away...Bravo Estee Lauder!!",3
Well I really wanted to love Damn Girl but cant totally discredit it. I actually  like the brush and see a little bit of a curl but my fiance noticed my lashes weren't popping like they normally do with BTS so I use DG as a first coat and the add the BTS on top a few more times and I love it.,3
Well... smells good but I was expecting more glow on my skin... the spray button doesn’t work well so I have to push and push so many times to activate. I should buy the travel size first before. I’ll try to apply with a body brush next time,1
"Well... The mask is amazing. Not the first time I use it, first time in lavender though and it's great. However, HOWEVER, I received the lip balm totally empty - a brand new black tube filled with air.\nNeedless to say I'm not too happy with my purchase.",2
"Well well what a nice surprise. It might just be my new favorite concealer! It covers well enough without being cakey, it moisturizes my under eye and makes it appears brighter and smoother. I think this is a great option for someone looking to brighten and cover but still wants to look natural. This color is perfect for me, I'm a true light neutral with peach undertones. I am L07 in the foundation, so I agree the shades are off. If you are very fair they will probably be too dark for you. But really, I am impressed by this!",2
"Went back to my roots. I started wearing Clinique mascara at the advice of a friend and wore it for many years. However, they discontinued a few favorites and I move on. Well, I'm back! IT cosmetics has too much product on the wand when you take it out of the tube. Not so Clinique!! It's perfect! Was able to do my make up in less time. I will keep using this mascara until they stop making it!",3
"went into the store in usa, I'm from canada but the lady I talked to was part asian/hawaian n she glowed like she had a year long tan. so I asked her I have full foundation on n I wanna have more colors like a tan a shimmer like hers she brought me what she uses n I grabbed this pallet plus this liquid bronzer to go over my foundation so then the pallet stays on better. she was right and felt amazing walking the strip in vegas",2
"went to Sephora in desperate need of help...I'm 48yrs old with skin that is blotchy with broken blood vessels on my cheeks and sun damage so I needed a full coverage foundation that would also moisturize my dry skin. I have tried EVERY SINGLE  foundation under the sun with no luck until now!!! I use this in conjunction with Too Face born this way concealer and it is a winning combination! each product provides me with flawless full coverage and wears so well, both alone and together! I get compliments all the time about how great my makeup looks!!! never going to change again!!!",3
What a gorgeous product!  The Torrid shade is wonderful as well.  I apply using a damp beauty blender and it gives me a beautiful glowy wash of color without drying my skin like a powder.  I pair this with the Benefit Watt's Up Cream-to-Powder Highlighter over a 50/50 mixture of Bobbi Brown BB Cream and YSL Touche Eclat All-In-One-Glow tinted moisturizer.  No powders!,2
"what a great value for this set! the sephora employee told me they relaunched the app and I've had no problems so far. the device works great, and the tarte skincare is a great bonus. I've never tried their skincare, I'm excited to try it out!",0
"What a horror this particular shade/formula of eye primer is! Large pieces of glitter fall off and end up everywhere. I would of given it away but no-one wants a product that does that. Way past shimmer/glow it's just obnoxious,lol. Returning!",2
"What an all around great product! My face feels soft and glowy, soft, and fresh after using this. The smell is a bit strong at first, but it was easy to get used to it, and now I actually like it! I love that Tata Harper products are cruelty free. The only thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars is the price. The cost is a bit prohibitive, especially given the size of the container. Despite this, I probably will purchase this again.",0
What a smart and innovative mist! I love incorporating mists into my beauty routine because it gives the skin a dewy appearance. I love that it is a fine mist as well. The fact that this one also protects mu skin from the light emitted from my phone and computer screen makes it even better! Definitely one that I always carry with me and re-apply throughout the day to stay glowy and protected!,1
"What a wonderful skincare product! This mist sprays natural micro particles of moisture and plumping hydration. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft, and it's so refreshing! I had to get a second bottle and a third for my mom!",4
What can I say? I love this eyeliner so much but good Lord is it expensive. I received this free in exchange for my honest opinion and honestly..... yes I will be purchasing this when it runs out. I've been testing it for 3 weeks and have never had to shake it or do anything to get the product out. It's smooth and never skips which makes for a very easy line. It's not the blackest and it doesn't have a super impressive wear time but the ease of use and seemingly endless product inside makes it a joy to work with. It's an investment but truly worth it if you want an effortless liner. I really only used the brush side. I found the calligraphy end to be a little above my abilities. though I can appreciate how easy a winged liner would be just from the shape of the applicator. 10/10 would recommend!,1
"What can I say, this item is a cult favorite for a reason. I have used Clinique 3 step for years and this continues to be my go-to daytime moisturizer. I like that it can be purchased in mini size for when I'm traveling or don't have $36 for a large one.",2
"What I was hoping for: some concealing and illuminating that looks natural and not overly “makeup-y”\nWhat I got: Exactly that!\nI hate under eye concealers. They always look cakey on my “mid-30s, have some eye wrinkles and dark circles” skin even if I am really careful not to use too much or get it too close to my eyes. I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone and normal to dry eyes and cheeks. This was perfect for me...moisturizing but not greasy. I used just a tiny bit at a time on my darks circles lightly tapping it into spots I wanted some brightening. It helped me to stand back from the mirror a bit as I was doing this...looking at my whole face rather than fixating too close up. No miracle “it looks like I have baby skin again!” but my under eye skin looked brighter (healthier, less tired) and not like I was wearing a bunch of makeup, which was my aim. I’m very happy with this product, and it should last a long time since I truly only used the tiniest amount! \n\nColor-wise it blended in perfectly with my Erborian BB cream in Clair. I have light skin with olive-neutral undertones. I used a bit of Laura Mercier powder to set everything (mostly oily t-zone).",1
"what junk is this. First of all it appears black to me, I see no sparkles at all and hav to go back and forth 10 times to see anything. Garbage. I only bought this because a beauty blogger gave it a b . Which it does not deserve. I would give it an F. Glad I only paid 7 bucks for it.",3
when ai received this product I was excited to be able to try out a new concealer as I had been testing out others as well. When I swatched it it was wayy too light for me to even try to make it work. so I Unfortunately wasn't able to really give it a fair chance. I do eventually want to get my correct shade in order to test it out. it felt similar to the foundation and like it wasn't going to be cakey either. And for now since I haven't been able to really test it out I can't recommend it to others.,1
"When I added this to my cart online and contemplated purchasing a ridiculously tiny bottle of sunscreen for my face for twenty dollars, I didn't hold out much hope.  That's a huge con, but it's not quite enough to prevent me from saying, 'At last!'  This definitely does what it says it should do, I use acids and this prevents my skin from getting damaged in the sun.  I don't break out from this, my sensitive skin doesn't burn upon application, and it doesn't oxidize.  There is no white cast, no yellowing of the skin (though my undertones are olive, my skin is fair) and it blends seamlessly into the skin.  A little goes a long way, and I don't use my fingers to apply this, I use a beauty blender as I can stretch this very liquidy sunscreen all the way to my collarbones and the back of my neck.  Will definitely repurchase.",4
When I applied this foundation it literally left my skin flawless. It was so lightweight and barely felt like I was wearing anything at all. If I could rate this foundation a 8 that's were it would be. Go buy this! You wont regret it.,0
"When I apply this antioxidant serum under my moisturizer, my skin comes to life. It feels soft, smooth, radiant & hydrated. It feels so luxurious & I wish I could apply it to my whole body. I highly recommend this product.",3
"When I first opened this, I though for a minute I had gotten a used palette. But no, the shadows are just that muddy and the fallout is that bad. The mattes aren't too bad, but the metallics and shimmers are the worst products I've seen UD put out. Nearly impossible to blend; they basically smeared into one weird color, half of which ended up scattered under my eyes and on my cheeks. This is going back immediately.",2
"When I first started using this I didn't see any results. I did some more reading on this and it seems the molecules of this active are too large to really penetrate and be effective. Not to be deterred, I switched up my strategy - if it wasn't going to penetrate the skin barrier, I'd help it along. I now apply this after microneedling and I think it enhances the effect. The firming and smoothing of my smile lines, crows feet, and forehead grooves is going faster than in the first few months of just derma rolling + HA + moisturizer routine. \n\nThis is a thin serum, but it absorbs quickly without feeling tacky.",3
"When I first tried this, I used too much and my face peeled! Please use sparingly, I was reluctant to try again but after my face was back to normal (actually BETTER than normal!) I have been using regurly and my skin looks amazing! Yes you can turn back time!",2
"When I first tried this product I didn’t like it, I decided to try again since it was on sale and choose a different color, I had first tried walnut, this time I got dark brown and let me tell you it’s a world of difference! This one looks soo natural on my skin tone and it almost looks like my own eyebrows! I’m so happy I gave it another try because it just makes my life easier and faster to get ready in the mornings, if you have a child and are running around in the mornings like I do then you’ve  got to try this amazing product!",2
"When I first tried this product in the store, I was so amazed of how fast it plumped my lips, that I immediately bought it. I was happy with it the first weeks. with my bigger lips and my lipstick looked beautiful, but now after months of having it, I can say, I won't repurchase. It does work, plumps your lips and you feel it working, but it tastes really HORRIBLE!!! and the tingling sensation doesn't go away in hours. Lip plumpers have that sensation normally. but with this one you feel like you put mint on your lips, for hours (with only one drop of product) Even if it works, it's so expensive and uncomfortable to wear :/",0
"when I first used this, I used a brush and was not impressed. It left me looking very shiny despite using setting powders. I tried applying with my fingers and lightly rubbing it in as if I were applying sunscreen and the results were SO much better. I didnt even have to use setting powder. I knocked off one star because I wouldn't call this color correcting. coverage is very mild... so if you just have one of those days where you dont really care about discoloration or other blemishes showing, but just dont wanna look totally gross.. this does the trick.",4
"When initially opening the product, I found the applicator  shredded into pieces. The product inside was very thick and hard to spread evenly. Upon drying, even the less glittery side left glittery fallout all over the cheeks for the rest of the day.",1
"When I read other reviews, I didn’t think it could possibly work as well as people were saying. However, it really does whiten well! It’s fast and easy to use with noticeable results with in one or two uses. I’m already on my second one.",0
when i received this package everything was in perfect condition and my eyes gravitated towards the green and browns and oranges .. i have 6 other natasha denona products and i love them.THIS PALETTE has so many rustic shades and omg they look so amazing for fall season vibes and Thanksgiving vibes lol... i really love it and the cream to powder matte SHADOWS blend amazing and are true to pigments!,4
"When I received this product, I'm amazed with the packaging it was really nice. This is my first time using Perricone MD brand, definietly it is going to be one of the brand to consider in the future. Value for the price is good. I have been using it for weeks now. It has a medicinal smell, and it is not as bad as what people described, I smelled other product that has a really awfull smell compare to this one. The textures is light and has a very soft grain, and it's easily absorb in my skin. I noticed my skin is brighter and is improving in the fine lines. My skin got a little bit dry after using the serum, bit when you combine with your moisturizer everything is good. I have a sensitive skin and sometimes it is sting a little bit, I think it's because of my dry skin but it goes a way after putting the moisturizer.",2
"When I received this product to try from Influencer, it arrived with the component broken. I was still able to use it though. The component was super cute. The applicator was huge and held lots of product. You only need a small dot to conceal and correct a fairly large space. It goes on super smooth and soft. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. I love Benefit products so I was disappointed that this was such a let down. It immediately started to ball up on my skin, leaving it dry and cakey. I didn't leave it on for long because it felt horrible and continued to ball up. This is a pass for me. I'll go back to the creamier concealers I know and love.",2
"When I turned 46 (I'm almost 48 now), the skin on my cheeks have become pretty dry... this was never the case before. In the winter it's especially bad, so at night I use this moisturizer... and HOLY CRAP it's beautiful. It's so silky and rich, and a little goes a very long way. This jar will easily last me a year. It is such a treat to apply-- it feels and smells absolutely luxurious.\n\nFYI, if you're like me and sometimes use night creams during the day for the really dry patches on cold days, don't do it with this stuff... you'll look like the Exxon Valdez and your makeup will slide right off. Save this for nighttime use only. It is an absolute joy to use.",3
"When I was considering buying this curler, I thought to myself, ""How different/better could it be from other curlers?"". Well, I got my answer. This curler has a slightly wider opening, so you don't have to wiggle it onto your lashes like most curlers and it's slightly wider so he whole length of your lash base is aligned with the curler pad. It's curvature angle isn't as deep so it's especially perfect for flatter eyes, monos and hooded. And because of the extra width, good for large eyes.  It would also seem to work for small,  average size eyes, and average set eyes.  The only group of people I would possibly think this curler would not work for are, those with very small, deep set eyes because I think a wide curler would have difficulty fitting into a small deep set eye (orbital socket).  Average and large eyes that are deep set would have an easier time.  Also those with average to large protruding eyes may find this curler not fitting as well as protruding eyes seem to have more of an extreme, rounder (the exact opposite of a flat eye) eyeball curve.   Just my guess, if you really want to know if this curler is for you, you just have to try it.  I have the older silver tone one, not the gunmetal. I prefer the silver one because I can see my lashes better up against the lighter silver tone.",3
When Sephora didn't have this in stock I panicked! That's how much I love this. Thankfully  it's back. It makes my legs and arms look 10 years younger. I LOVE  the smell! I have reordered this more than anything Sephora has.,3
"When there's something I want, I usually grab it. I'm not the type to wait too long if an item grabs my interest. That's pretty much true for things I'll call my personal A-List. But there are always other products that are interesting, but they don't quite hit the same level of ""I have to have this!"" as the A-List items. \n\nNow interestingly, there are several products in this Self Care Essentials set that I've always wanted to try, but either time or chance interfered with their acquisition. I have a bunch of Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks, and matte is my favorite formula, but for some reason I'm the only human being in the Western hemisphere who has never got around to swatching Pillowtalk. I've heard great things about Too Faced's Peach face powder, and again, it's something I was interested in, but a backlog of translucent powders kept me away. The Beauty Blender pocket puff? Again, another unique item that aroused my curiosity (but not enough to bump it up to A-List status.)\n\nSo combine these ""almost, but not quite"" products I wanted to try...someday....with a bunch of other things I use and love: the Bum Bum cream, Ouai texturizing spray, Living Proof dry shampoo, and you have what's possibly THE perfect box.\n\nAnd since I hesitated, because the price of this box is a bit steeper than most other Favorites, it went on sale! How could I resist?\n\nI'm glad I didn't. This is in my top three Sephora Favorites sets this year (granted, there wasn't a whole lot of competition in 2019.) Everything came in a perfect size to try, and I was thrilled at pretty much everything. Even the candle was a delight.\n\nThis is such a well curated, all-around box that it's a perfect gift for any woman who loves being pampered. I would absolutely recommend this as perhaps the best Christmas present for anyone on your list who loves luxury.  If you know of the other six people left in the world who don't own CT's Pillowtalk, do them a favor and gift this to them. They'll thank you forever!",2
"When used as directed (not over applied, and allowing it to dry before putting on moisturizer) it is a dream.  It has helped my eczema prone skin clear up significantly in just over a week. I will definitely be looking into other products from The Ordinary based on how much I love this stuff!",1
"When will I learn!  three years of calendars, three red lipliners, three black eyeliners.  Is it so hard to mix it up year to year?  So many masks too - more than half the items.  Cheaper and cheaper items every year.  Will not be buying next year - there are many other quality item advent calendars out there. Waste of $.",3
"Where do I begin! I have combo skin, acne scars and mild rosacea. I'm a skincare junkie and mix  between Dermatologist/clinical brands (IS Clinical, Skinceuticals, Skin Medica) and popular brands from Sephora. The only thing missing from my routine was a good Vitamin C Serum. I  tried them ALL. Many are very similar: tacky, thick and smell like pennys etc. I used an entire bottle of IS Clinical Super Serum. It wasn't BAD but, it did nothing great for my skin. I went to sephora and tried 5 samples (Pharmacy, Tatcha, Kate Sommerville and Olehenriksen). Instantly I LOVED the texture of the CC Me Serum. It has a mild smell and light texture. It melts into my skin so nice and provides a perfect base for makeup. My sometimes-oily-skin didnt get clogged or congested and g.l.o.w.e.d!! Which brings me to the most important part....my skin has NEVER looked better. I'm actually shocked after only 4 weeks how GOOD my skin looks. Glowing, hydrated, less red and somehow less oily. I'm so happy I tried this ...RUN and go try it for yourself.",1
"While getting this for free to try, I am not a huge fan. I use a Japonesque curler daily for my everyday work-friendly makeup and much prefer that to the Laura Mercier Artist Curler. It may be my eye shape, but it doesn't curl my lashes very well, and is hard to get close to the base of them with the curler (again, could be due to my eye shape) overall, just not a great personal fit for me. Will probably not be using this again anytime soon, if I am honest!! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",4
"while I do really like this toner I started to realize that for what it does which is to hydrate the skin it really doesn't do all that, I've found to that a face mist that I got from Walmart pretty much does the same exact thing except that one is way cheaper plus the rose bits within it gets really annoying because it clogs up the spout once you start getting towards the end so it's really hard to use 100% of the product. so while I definitely enjoyed using this product I don't plan on repurchasing",0
"While I like this product, I'm not sure it's right for summertime.  My skin does seem to get a little oily during the day while I'm wearing it.  However, I love the coverage and you only need a tiny bit.  It does smell like oil paint, but the scent fades rather quickly once it's applied.",3
"While I'm not familiar with all the products from the Drunk Elephant yet, this duo is brilliant. When a product is efficient, the skin shows improvement pretty fast, two to three days are enough to notice a difference. This duo did this for me which is rare.",1
"While my skin loves this mist, my lungs were aching for air! Okay a little dramatic but seriously, everytime I used it, I coughed for about a minute. That's a deal breaker for me and I don't know what the ingredient could possibly be that is triggering the coughing for so many of us. The first time it happened, I thought I'd accidentally sprayed it up my nose and I breathe in at the wrong moment. But on the subsequent uses, I still coughed. I got this in a trial gift set (it also came with the Pink Cloud moisturizer and Prism serum) so I'm finish it but I definitely won't be purchasing the full size. I hope Herbivore reformulates this mist and removes the offending ingredient because it is otherwise wonderful for my skin.",2
"while some may complain about the packaging, I'd rather pay for product. This is a bargain for the price and a great way to try PML\nBeautiful color, no fallout, great staying power, and easy to work with. I love this little gem.",3
"While the colors are beautiful, calling them is an overstatement. The packaging had come open in the box and they were so small, I almost threw them out looking for them because if you don't unwrap and unfold every piece of tissue paper in the box, you'll completely miss them. I recommend using them on a night where you won't need to reapply, because after 1 or 2 reapplication, it'll probably be spent.",2
"While the color was pretty, the product was terribly frying.  I had to take it of.  Before I did that I tried drinking a glass of water, this is at least 15 min after I put it on.  I ended up with stain just like I would lipstick which is the primary reason I tried a stain.  Sending back.",3
"While the packaging is beautiful, there are a few flaws with this product that really shouldn't be happening for such a high price point. It's not good for the lower lashes, as I get transferring within only a few hours, and when you apply to both the upper and lower lashes, they start to stick together after about six hours. On just the top lashes though this is a good mascara, I wish it would work for the bottom too, as it gives the bottom lashes a long, full look despite the transferring.",0
While the products are definitely trial size so quite small. The selection of products for this box was favorable. I have been a huge fan of the  Tarte mascara for a while so this small one is perfect to throw in my purse. Also the Fresh lip balm is AMAZING. It's creamy and goes on like a lip balm lip gloss hybrid. Will for sure be ordering a full size of it. Have not tried the other products but am looking forward to doing so. Was it worth the $10? For sure.,0
"While this mascara definitely adds length, I found it really lacked in adding volume. It also smudged bad when trying to apply and flaked off into my eyes during the day. I will be going back to using the Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara.",0
"While this product does smooth the skin it is also extremely heavily perfumed, I recieved this as a sample and I did definitely notice it smooth out my skin. Yet that excitement was overshadowed by the overwhelming perfume trying to choke me. Will be throwing out that sample and continuing with my Illamasqua instead!!!!",0
"Whoa!! what a difference! I pick up the Sephora masks every once in a while. Winter has been especially drying, so I chose today to use this ""ultra moisturizing & brightening mask"". First, it is pretty straight forward, wash face, unwrap, apply to face, 15 mins, gently massage remaining solution into skin, don't rinse. I am grateful the size of the mask was spot on. I even used the peel off portion to wipe more moisture solution on my neck before I set the timer. Not only was this super refreshing, super moisturizing, it also feels lovely afterward and has just the lightest rose scent. Too much floral gives me a headache, not this though.",3
"Why are people so disappointed by this palette? I fit 18 shadows from ABH palettes in it as well as 3 from my Naked Petite Heat. It is really deep, but since I don't need another mirror I'm thinking about depotting my Naked Ultimate Basics and putting them over the mirror to clear up even more space in my train case",3
"Why did I wait so long? I don't understand why this would be on sale, it is so awesome! The only drawback is that is lacks any matte shadows, but really, I have plenty to supplement. gorgeous color and pigments, but you will need an eye primer to lock it in.",4
"Why didn't I buy this sooner???  I always read rave reviews regarding the Pillow Talk collection and am so happy I finally purchased the blush and eye palette.  Beautiful.  The blush is perfection.  It is a beautiful neutral shade with a slight sheen.  I can't even call it a shimmer, since it's barely there.  It does not settle into wrinkles and is so buildable.  Just a beautiful shade that flatters my skin tone so nicely.",2
"Why did they change this formula?  I've been using the old formula and it went on like silk.  This new formula is more difficult to blend, looks cakey and feels more heavy on my face.  Please go back to the old formula which is so much better!",3
"Why I use: I have very dry, acne prone, sensitive, prematured, pale 23 year old skin.\n\nHow I use: Morning after exfoliating I apply one spout directly to the face with fingers gently smoothing all over and then applying my face mask and day skincare, ect. Evening I apply one spout directly to the face after cleansing with fingers, then I add my night skincare. I have been using for 4 months (not even half way through the bottle).\n\nBenefits I saw: This product truely smooths and brightens your skin. The red aglae plumps the crap out of my dry dehydrated lifeless skin. This product is not fancy water, it is 98.7% fermented red aglae (plumping and hydrating the skin), green tea (antioxidants), and rice water (antiaging). I actually got to play with the ingredients seperatly with Tatcha and red aglae is incredible, it holds water 1000x it's size and feels amazing. \n\nWhat would I change: Perhaps purchasable in multiple sizes so I can have a travel size, bringing the large one around with me is a hassle.  \n\nWould I continue using: 100% will continue to use in my daily skincare routine. \n\nWould I recommend: 100% to someone who is looking for that extra step in their skin care and able to spend the price and time using an essence. \n\nSummary:\nBEAUTIFUL essence. Truely plumps and smooths the skin, I love this product. For me I don't let it dry before adding my other skin care as I don't want it to evaporate off my skin. Some will say to let it dry first. Also please apply with your hands, NOT cotton. And yes, you can use essence after toner. Also the spout is pre-measured for you, so just tip the bottle into your hand and that is all you need, don't shake the bottle.",4
"Why I use: I have very dry (except my nose is oily), acne prone, sensitive, prematured, red, 23 year old pale skin.\n\nHow I use: Daily only at night time after my cleanse, essence, and Vit C serum and then before my night concentrate & night mask. About one pump all over the face avoiding the eye area. The first few uses I did have some exfoliating effects such as tingling, heat, and redness but that subsides after a few minutes, but this is very normal and will happen less and less with continued use.\n\nBenefits: Within a week all my acne had cleared up (I do use a salicylic cleanser and DrDG extra strength peel pads), and I have been trying to clear this acne for months now. Also my oily nose is now not oily. It is very hydrating for a salicylic mattifying serum, I have not experienced any dryness. It does have a mild exfoliation which does not irritate my skin but it does make my skin look very smooth and bright. Clears up any texture! Also huge bonus for the perfect ingredient list.\n\nWhat I would change: It is pretty matte once it dries down, which does not effect me because I add other products over top, so this is definitely not a use alone product.\n\nWill I continue to use: I will use this for a few more weeks to fully make sure my acne is gone, but after that I will only use once or twice a week as a preventative measure. I will rebuy once I empty the bottle.\n\nWould I recommend: Yes, to any skin type with blemishes or clear oily skin. I would also recommend to use once or twice a week to prevent any blemishes (acne, blackheads, congestion, ect) and it is a very nice chemical exfoliant serum.\n\nSummary:\nNon drying effective formula with GREAT ingredients. Saved my acne skin.",4
"Why oh why can I only get Vegas and Phoenix directly from Kosas?!? Phoenix is beautiful...wears evenly and stains lips. Rosewater is nice too, exactly as described- cool toned pink nude. But Phoenix is everything! I like the secure magnetic click too.",2
Wish I had read the reviews before I bought this. the formula is watery and weak and very disappointing for Dior. the only reason I am giving it two Stars instead of one is because Rosewood is a lovely color. Nowhere near the price,3
"With all the sheet masks out there, it’s hard to navigate the over saturation of gimmicky products. Sephora’s masks offer a great simple product that you can count on. I personally have used the green tea mask for years for my combo skin. I find that when I use this, I wake up with smoother, more mattified skin, with reduced redness and reduction in any active acne or blemishes. I’ve never had a product work so well overnight before and continuously for years. The masks themselves tend to be on the thinner side which I personally prefer over the thick cotton masks of other brands, and for a small face like me they are a bit big but I just fold over the edges. They come very well soaked with serum and there is often leftover serum in the package.",0
"Within 48 hours, I had breakouts on my nose, chin, and forehead. I rarely get breakouts and I've never seen so many on my face. I love the Rose moisturizer by Fresh, so I was super disappointed when this reaction happened. The product smells and feels great, but definitely not for me.",1
"With my aging eye skin, I love this product because its TALC FREE and the colors are perfect for everyday work makeup. The shimmer is beautiful - not overdone. The only reason for 4 stars is the white highlight color is a bit pasty looking and sometimes I use a different highlight color. The individual color pallets provides a lot of product compared to other products where each pallet is small and thin. Would buy this brand again as long as its TALC FREE.",3
"With so many reviewers complaining about the smell you should know this smells like lavender.\nNow, let's clear the air by saying essential oils are not good for your skin. They're called volatile for a reason. But this didn't irritate my super sensitive skin too much, but I think it contributed to some break outs.\nAs for the product it's self... I hate it. lol\nIt doesn't work as a priming or setting spray. It oiled my base and left it feeling unset all day. So, foundations that are typically pretty secure (revlon stick and candid, also infalable pro glow) become sticky, tranfer terribly, and crease like no other. It also made my maybaline fit me concealer immediately separate.\nI've also tried with the Laura Mercier loose powder and it does the same thing, whether the powder goes on first or second.\nI was ok with the price for the size, especially if you like the product because you can unscrew the sprayer to reuse the bottle. Really nice feature. The sprayer is generous, which I liked, but didn't spray evenly. I had droplets on my face.\nI think It's worth a try if you have a super mattifying foundation that need hydration, or if you have extremely dry skin.\nbtw, I'm oily in my tzone, hyper dry in muh cheeks, and normal everywhere else. aka my jaw.",4
Wonderfully hydrating cream! I use it as a night cream. It is too heavy and thick for day use (for me). You do not need alot of product! Did wonders for my skin while I was traveling. Smells nice and isn't over powering.,4
"Wonderful product. I have recently started using the Softner along with the Cleanser, Moisturizer, and Eye Cream. A Small but significant MIRACLE. My skin is firmer, silky to the touch and far more radiant. The Softner is luxurious and I believe allows your skin to absorb the next product fully. In addition, it does remove any excess makeup left behind. I am SOLD!",4
"Wonderful! They are sturdy wipes, but not rough at all! was able to wash off everything. Some say it has an Orange Scent, but I find it to be more of a soft vanilla ice cream scent! I was looking for a wipe that I could use for excessive sweating, that would not cause break outs, and not a super strong scent, for when I am having migraines! (I have Hyperhydrosis and sweat like crazy around my face!) These were beautiful!! I only got the travel size, but I'll be going back for more!",2
"Woof. Coverage is really good but if you have any wrinkles it will magnify those x’s 200. Gross. Primer helped a little but not enough. Would not recommend it for anyone 28 and up with wrinkles that reason. There are so many full coverage Matte foundations out there that don’t sink into wrinkles and pores, this isn’t one of them.",0
"Words cant describe how good it is, It`s the most moisturizing yet lightweight serum/moisturizer I`ve ever used and I have used all kinds of expensive and inexpensive skincare in my life, this is truly one of the best. It really is moisturizing enough to be worn alone as a serum/moisturizer in one, and does not flake under foundation, I `ve never seen anything like this before, I plan to buy 5  to stock up when the next Sephora sale comes around",0
"worked for a month and a half but then stopped charging and I had to charge it daily. I am returning it. The base is cheap and flimsy and I do have 2 previous models which happen to be very nice and well made. the brush head is great, I love it.",3
"Works as promised but the real Hero of this product line, in my opinion, is the cleanser.  If you start of with the Mega-mushroom Skin Relief cleanser, the toner or lotion portion is more or less open to suggestion as long as it's not too harsh.",2
Works great but that smell? omg horrible...I'd rather use st tropez just for that reason. it smells like pure strong maple. Eww. Super sticky too. The colour is beautiful tho. Gives a super natural dark tan. I just cant get past the smell. I prefer the tan on this one but the smell of st tropez (which isn't great by any means) is a lot more tolerable.,2
Works great for sleepy puffy eyes and to help with smoothing fine lines a bit. Lost a star for leaving my face a bit tacky when put all over to sooth redness but one of the best products I have used for puffy under eyes.,3
"Works great on my fragile, hyper sensitive skin. Love the soothing texture. Not stiff or tacky. Use it like a lip mask and wake up to smooth lips in the morning. Nice in inclement weather, too, as a barrier balm.",3
"Works on lashes better than brows. Not false lashes long, of course. But both show noticeable growth.\n\nThis is not something I would put on hair AFTER a wash. I use it as a mask massaging on to the scalp than wash off after couple hours as dry scalp treatment.",3
"Worst foundation I've used in my 32 years of wearing makeup! I have tried applying with a brush and a sponge, neither provides medium coverage. This does not set down so I'm not sure how you could build it. When I went to set it with powder things got even worse. Loose powder adheres in a very patchy and weird way. It really makes my oily combo skin look dry. When I tried a pressed powder the oily silicone attached to the brush and caused hard pan after 2 swirls into the pan! This NEVER sets down. You can't blend other products on top of it, even after you set it with powder. It just moves everything around and grabs very weird. It's sticky and comes off on everything! And because it never sets it moves around, separates and creases like nothing else I've ever seen! It looks cakey, cracky and accentuates every pore, line or texture on your skin. I look 10 years older! I'm done trying to find a way to tolerate this. It is going back for sure!",3
"Worst texture I have ever experienced.\n\nI fully prepped my skin before using this product and yet it was like rubbing sandpaper onto my face - it pilled and dried out my skin in some areas, pooled into others, and covered nothing. My whole face looked orange and completely caked over.\n\nTried it to cover my rosacea, and I'd rather go out with a rosacea flare-up and no foundation than with this on my skin.",1
"WOW! First time using any of the Fresh products, and I am s believer now! I've been using this for a month now at night and my skin is dewy and soft, perfect for winter time!  Gorgeous scent and luxurious creamy feel!",3
"WOW!! I am officially obsessed with this Makeup Line. These are the best eye shadows; from the texture to the color payoff, they are phenomenal! I've bought several palettes and can't wait for them to expand their line. I highly recommend these shadows. I LOVE how they put their ""main"" focus on the actual product. Love the very neutral packaging which is also brilliantly made! The shadows are so beautiful, smooth and creamy. They blend so nicely, you don't be disappointed. Money well spent!!",3
"wow! I am really loving this concealer! It is a medium coverage, natural finish. I am able to build it up without it looking or feeling cakey. The consistency is kind of a whipped feeling. it's hard to explain, but I love it. This does not set fast, thankfully. I forgot to wet my beauty sponge before applying the concealer, but I didn't have a problem blending it out. The applicator is a little strange, but I think it helps to not use so much product.",1
"wow I am so impressed and surprised by this foundation. I have normal to dry skin with fine lines and wrinkles and live in hot and humid bipolar weather conditions in Florida.  This feels weightless and airy on the skin as if theres nothing on it. It has a dry oil type of thin texture and I found it best applied with your fingers first and then a beauty blender in my experience.  It is flawless and has a satin natural finish to it, I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS MATTE AND IM GLAD!  I hate matte foundations and they usually look awful on my skin but this most definitely is not matte. I use tatcha silk canvas and juno & co miracle cream under it as well as  biossance squalane +  vitamin c rose oil and it looks so beautiful all day and when I say all day I mean over 13 hours. I don't even need to set this except under my eyes over my concealer if I do set it, i use the jouer pressed setting powder or the shiseido synchro   invisible skin radiant setting powder lightly. This does set to a pretty powder finish but it's a satin type finish maybe even a mixture of satin and natural finish, its extremely lovely. I've sweated in this and with alot of foundations I always loose coverage on my cupids bow when I sweat (I've found a few others that stay on as well) and this doesn't budge. I will mention you need a really good cleanser or micellar water to get this off because it is serious about staying on. I absolutely love this! I'm really glad I ignored the bad reviews because this is definitely a repurchase for me and that's alot to say because I own over 50 highend foundations but I will repurchase this when I run out, i adore this!",1
Wow I am very impressed! I've been using bare minerals for years and was skeptical. I keep hearing how good this is so I decided to try it out and I dotn regret it at all! Great coverage that lasts all day with setting spray. I just wish the container was smaller or they had a mini for purses because it's huge!,3
"Wow. I buy the Bite Beauty holiday sets every year, and this one tops them all. For my coloring (very light skin, cool toned), every single shade is a winner - even Cocoa Bite, which I was worried would wash me me out. These are extremely wearable shades, and the formula is lovely. I'm honestly considering picking up a second set just because these are ALL MLBB shades on me.",2
"Wow I'm really impressed at how nice this moisturizer it. It's really thick so a little will go a long way and it feels really hydrating. I put on a generous layer wake up with smooth soft skin. I'd recommend this to everyone. (for reference, I have dry sensitive skin)",0
"Wow! I received a sample of four colors in my last shipment and #999 is stunning. It is such a rich, vibrant red and feels like silk on my lips. It does require touch ups through out the day but I'm ok with that. Will definitely be purchasing the full size.",4
Wow! I received this and three other colors as a sample in my last shipment. The Matte Rouge #999 is stunning. unfortunately this colour is not available online so I couldn't choose that specific colour for review. The colour is absolutely beautiful. It feels like silk on. I will definitely be purchasing the full size.  It is the best matte I've ever worn. it doesnt dry your lips out or crack like others when it dries. it does require touch ups through the day but seriously so worth it!,4
Wow! I've been using this toner for almost a month and it is amazing! Gives me hydration after cleansing my face. I just wish they never added fragrance on this bottle and it  might just have been the most perfect toner ever.,0
"Wow...I was surprised that there were not more glowing reviews of this. I am 43, with normal-dry skin and this mask is a game changer for me. It hydrates and smooths my skin so well, even after 1 use. It has also calmed retinol and AHA breakouts numerous times for me. When my skin is angry about anything, this is my go to one use (or 2 uses if I have really aggravated it) skin care product. I wear it as long as possible then lightly rinse. I even steam my face while wearing it...amazing difference. Well worth it! I should note, I am a Sephora employee who has tried TONS of skincare! My favorite mask in the store along with a couple of the Dr. Jart masks!",4
Wow! I was totally impressed with this box. The samples were great sizes. I love getting hair samples. Love the Sunday Riley sample. Their products are fantastic and so expensive! Grab these kits while you can. Best bang for your ten bucks.,3
"Wow. Just wow. Tried these on the recommendation of an Instagram beauty blogger and I am so in love. Evens out skin tone and clears up acne without drying skin. Downside, these are insanely pricey, about $0.50 per pad.",0
"wow love this stuff. I was a little afraid because of the shea in it. but no breakouts, I'm shocked. this calms my skin and adds another level of hydration to my skincare which is great for winter. I use this with fab barriair cream and love the two together. even though I am not dry, more combo this is great for the dry areas, the normal areas and the oily areas of my face which is so amazing to me. (same with the barriair cream which I absolutely love, my holy grail)",1
"WOW!! So I tried this on my hands and noticed how immediately my hands smoothed out. After the product dried there was a white film left behind. I got a sample to use and used it on my face. The good thing is I was going to bed when I applied it to my face. the next morning my forehead was smooth. Yes the white cast was there, I rinsed it off to do my normal makeup routine. On my next application of the product, I mixed it with one of my favorite Tatcha Dewy Moisturizers. I just mixed it in for the forehead area. This product is Amazing. Does what it's supposed to.",3
"wow so much! never knew my brows could use so much and look so good! stayed on all day/night, didnt wake up bare but didnt wake up perfect eaither (dont judge me, I sleep in my brows) only thing that sucks is the colors. I'm a 5 but this set only offers a 4 (deepest brown) but it's cool I just added/blended my 5 shade in too. plus it comes in an adorable hat!",2
"WOW, so this is what I did....I priced all 4 items in the box, @ $59 (lotion) $25 (fragrance) $20 hand cream & $13 shower gel cream. That comes 2 $117- & each item/size is available @Sephoea NOW. I used my rouge member $25 off $75 (this kit is $77) & paid $52!!!!- $7.00 LESS than the full size bum bum cream alone. I'd already picked up a $90 Sephora Favs kit 4 $45 & it came w/ a 25ml mini of bum bum cream. ( the smallest size available for purchase is 75mls 4 $27, so I kept the mini jar and will be refilling the 25mls ($9.00 worth of cream) I decided when I purchased this that I would gift the safety sealed hand lotion, shower cream (& the refilled 25ml jar Ì cleaned out) for my 18 year old daughter, either as a very posh few stocking stuffers or as a gift all together.... that got me thinking, I hope everyone else purchases this $77 kit and uses their coupon for either $15, $20, or $25 off- this time of year is so expensive and we end up getting spread so thin that its nice 2 receive a treat like a full size jar of bum bum cream and the body and hair fragrance, leaving us with a beautiful, magnetized and sturdy box the items came in. It can be repurposed (mine is going to hold makeup) & having 2 diff. secret Secret Santa gifts (add a shower puff 2 gel=gift.ĺ( assuming there is a $10 or $20 limit) & keeping the box for yourself, or, giving the box along w/ the hand cream &/or shower gel as Christmas presents 4 ur fav girl ( my daughter won't mind I refilled a jar of lotion 4 her!) or 4 sons girlfriends, etc!!  To summarize; just the large jar is yours 4  $7 less than normal, ALL other items r literally $58 worth of freebies, PLUS the awesome Givenchy lipstick kit w/ lip brush sample & a Gucci perfume sample that came with it, even the delivery box it came in is perfect to wrap a present in, nothing will be wasted, all the products are as wonderful as they seemed, I have zero complaints, I love it!",4
"wow. stunning palette, I have bought from tarte before, their eyeshadow palettes have never really amazed me until I bought this! seriously.. stunning shades, amazing formula, so pigmented! they killed it",0
"WOW!!! THATS BLACK!!! AMAZING if Your into smokey eyes!!! Takes a while to dry down and you Really have time to work with it, but if you blink it will transfer, So if you have Hooded Eyelids Becareful!!! Take your time, I wish it would dry down faster because I have Hooded Eyelids!!! But BEAUTIFUL to have as a base to then apply All your Glitter looks!!!",3
"Wow, this is an excellent serum.  It has the consistency of a gel and feels smooth and cool on my skin.  My skin looks bright and healthy after using it!  I love the elegant packaging and the hygienic container.",1
"Wow!  This is a pigmented gloss that gives great color and hydration to your lips.  It's so moisturizing and comfortable!  I like to layer lip products to get the hydration and pigmentation for the longest period of time possible, like 4 hours, however I can wear this gloss alone and it will stay beautiful with eating or drinking for about 3 hours.  It's a little pricey but worth it.  It's an almost perfect gloss except for these drawbacks: 1) there are other high end glosses with more product per gram at a cheaper cost 2)  there aren't as many nude shades in this range that flatter my  warm olive skin tone and 3) smell is off putting!  I like the smell of mint, but this is the first gloss is the first one I've tried that smells like straight up toothpaste!  Luckily the smell dissapates after a bit.  I'm on the fence.  Don't hate it, don't love it!",4
"WOW!  This is the best brow powder. It really enhances and defines your brows.  I apply with a slanted brush and all it takes is one or two strokes.  But, it's messy. :(  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  You get brown powder in the compact that can blow around and land on clothes, spill out on vanity, etc.  The powder is soft and breaks apart easily making it a bit messy when used.  I wish it was a little harder pressed.",3
"WOW!!!! This Mascara beats ALL others by far! My lashes went up to my eyebrows! *I have been using GrandLash for about a year, so this helped make my eyelashes so long*, but this is a seriously awesome mascara!! Lashes were not clumpy, just long gorgeous lashes!",3
"Wow, this mist feels so nice on sensitive skin! I am in love with it.  After mister sprays out a very nice, fine mist. It immediately feels cooling and calming on the skin. After using this with the Cicapair serum and gel cream, I woke up to the most smooth, calm skin. My skin had been dry,  textured, and even sometimes itchy or irritated feeling. Not with these products! Honestly, my skin is looking better than it has in a few years. Definitely recommend. I recieved this product for free for testing and review purposes.",1
"wow.this stuff is impressive. I take very good care of my face, I am 47 but no one believes it, I have great skin and I didn't expect to see much after using this. but I noticed a difference immediately. I used this in conjunction with the hylauronic acid. I originally purchased this for my daughter who has dermographia ( super sensitive skin) and has been suffering through an acne flare up. she can't use my face products because of her sensitivity. well, she can use this, and it is working for her too. I also use this on the backs of my hands. I'm gonna order this stuff by the gallon.",3
"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! I'll be honest - I purchased this not being sure how or if I would be able to use it. At age 55, I certainly don't have the ability or desire to rock a unicorn look, or anything to sparkly or iridescent. But I was curious, and at the sale price, I decided to give it a try. It works beautifully as an eyeshadow. I use it on the lid, up into the crease, then darken my crease and outer corner with a different shade. Then I use it again as a top coat to blend it all together. That was my first attempt at using it, and it looked beautiful. I can't wait to try other looks. I won't be using it as a highlighter, but what I like the best about it is that it gives me a way of being on trend without going overboard and looking like I am trying to be 25 again. I think I will pick up another one, and perhaps a third to give as a gift. I am in love!",4
"Wow. Where has this product been all my life?! It's fabulous.  I purchased it in the Sephora store in ""#182 Pro Purple"" (why it's not listed on line as a shade I do not know but the store has it). This eyeliner allows you to go tight to your lashline, and I mean tighter than any other liner I've experienced. The line it leaves is smooth, and foolproof. The tenacity of the product is amazing: a line mark on my hand stayed through multiple washings, and the line on my eyelids stayed brand new looking until I was ready to take it off after a veeerrry long hard day of wear. You can make delicate lines or bold ones. Perfect for beginners and pros alike. This is my new holy grail of eyeliners. Sad that Sephora doesn't show all the shades available on line so I can purchase it from home and have to go over to the Dior site. If you are in the marker for an eyeliner, DO purchase this one you will not be disappointed!",2
"WOWZA!   \nMy skin doesn't really fit in any category, except maybe ""moody"".  I am prone to breakouts, and anything that has ever claimed to be non pore blocking has been laughable and a drain on my wallet. \nSo I am one of those who tried HUM collagen the same time I tried face hero, BUT I will never quit either.  I am fussy, most products are wasted on me, but this product alone or combination have been better performers than a trip to my Derm doctor.  I am over 50 and have been accused of being 40.  That in itself is priceless IMO.",3
Writing again I love all milk makeup lip and cheek colours swatch. They all different in colours and tone .  I got perk is  coral and bright.alittle shimmer but it's nice Werk muted pink more on thickely dense color. Okay . Now for the quickie I was hasitated to buy cause it looks very dark. Wow it is sheer stain and very flushy fresh looking. Now that was what I was looking for. Fantastic . It going to last for awhile . The only thing is the scent well the color overthrown the scent. In fact milk products everything has a kind of smell,3
"yah so we all got this in our boxycharm cause people were not about to be paying over 40 bucks for this so they had a ton of overstock (just my opinion) lol.\nit's okay. it smells like roses so if you like the smell of roses and can't think of any other way to spend your money, then by all means. as for usefulness, it seems okay as a prime. did I mention it smells like roses?",4
yayyy i got this set and the 3 day gloss set. i love them and they are my survival tools thru the cold weather. i already had the original but i wanted to try both of the new flavor/scents without buying full size because this stuff lasts a longgggg time. so im so glad i got to try them in deluxe size along with a full size bottle. i love them and so do my lips.,1
Yeah the product is soo smooth and soo easy to apply. But！But… such a good bundle，it is tragic that cant find a shade to fit you！Benefit came out with those sets without black shades. Can benefit think of Asian people with black hair who really desire a soft black bundle instead of those warm tone browns lol?! Then we would be much more appreciate it! but the products are great.,4
"Yeah, these are all huge NO's for me. I absolutely love Sephora and many of their high end lines. However, for me, C.T leaves a lot to he desired. I really was considering the Pillow Talk quad. I'm a nudes gal and it looks stunning on the website. I'll even admit that the shades look lovely in the palette. .. However I just cannot fathom paying that price for shades that are just ""meh"". Back in the day, the quad would have sufficed, but now there are SOOO many beautiful palettes out there. Many of which, you can get for far cheaper, with more payoff/pigment and at least triple the amount of colors. \nTake it from me, don't waste your money!",4
"Yes finally some Urban Decay lippies for me! I'm completely happy. I have had their lip glosses before but not lipsticks. I'm also glad you can open these without fear of nicking them when doing so, the lipstick is completely within the case. Yay! I like that it included ones from several collections.",3
"Yes, I read some negative reviews..However, I disagree big-time over this versatile gem. Its all about the application and using a light hand. Its great after applying shadow, liner, mascara..then apply and give it a few seconds..Voila glossy Lids. Also, great as a general highlighter on cheeks etc. If you need a Tutorial its not for you...It is available in other shades as well..Definitely worth the price.",4
"Yes it has glitter & yes it's beautiful. It applies heavenly. I dont understand why the metal crush highlighters were scrutinized for its micro glitter, but Fenty's how many carats doesn't. Anyway this is perfect for the holidays!",3
"Yes these are minis. What people seem to forget is that two or these three minis are sold individually already; the mini primer (28$) and the mini highlighter (29.50$). Only the mini powder is a bit less than half the regular mini size at 2.3g (reg. mini is 5g). So yes, this is a good value set. Do the math before accusing brands of giving out cheap samples.",0
"Yes, the wand is big, and a new tube has a lot of product on it. I simply wipe the end on the opening to remove excess. After the first couple of weeks, it loads the perfect amount of product to do 2 coats on both eyes without reloading. It did take a couple applications to adjust my technique with the bigger brush so I'm not leaving dots of mascara on my eyelids or under eye, but after that I've not had issues. This is an amazing mascara - truly creates volume without clumping, easily separates lashes with even distribution - before this I hadn't found a mascara that didn't require I use a spoolie or comb to fix clumps and/or better separate lashes. I stopped using products without very dense brushes like BTS or Pat McGrath FetishEyes. I especially dislike silicone style bristles because each tine (or tooth?) is too widely spaced so they don't separate lashes well. I use Lancome's lash primer and wow - it's no exaggeration to say that it looked like I was wearing falsies. My lashes are naturally long but I don't have a lot of them. It didn't really seem to lengthen them but Damn Girl! did it volumize, without the lashes getting stuck together. Primer isn't even needed with DG. I never use a curler because of how thin/sparse my lashes are - they would break or fall out, making them even more sparse than they already are. I love how BTS applies but flaking and fall-out were a problem after just a couple of hours. My Pat McGrath FetishEyes would look pretty worn out by the end of the day, too (really love the brush on that one!). DG had absolutely NO fall out with a solid 8 hours of wear, even after a 30 minute accidental nap (hadn't planned to doze off whilst reading). The wand isn't going to be for everyone, but if you like BTS or dense bristles (even more so than the BTS), give this a try.",3
Yes. This is great. It comes with two in a pack. I used them twice in a four days span and my dark circles look very noticeably different. I have sensitive skin and did not have any kind of reaction after leaving these on over night. The instructions say to leave on for two hours so listen to me with caution. =)\n\nI highly recommend. Peep the pics.,0
"YES YES and a million times YES. This has a super fine mist and smells like a field of peaches. I would not call it a setting spray because it doesn't do anything to extend makeup wear time, but it does work wonders to rehydrate dry skin throughout the day even on top of makeup. I got the large size but really want a mini to keep in my handbag for daytime pick me ups. LOVE this!",0
"Yes yes yes! I am loving this primer so far. it feels so nice on the skin, super light and absorbs quickly without feeling sticky or anythings like that. I love how it is literally like the name says - CLEAN. my sensitive skin approves",0
"Yikes! I'm not sure what ingredient my skin reacted too but this made me horribly red and splotchy. I don't have sensitive skin at all, I couldn't imagine the reaction on someone who does. After about 5 minutes on my face I felt a bit of discomfort and took it off right away. Also not a fan of the two piece face mask, I found the bottom half to keep sliding down my face. I have the avacado sleep mask and love it, so I was very excited to try more products from this brand. This one is definitely a miss from me.",1
"You can wear this as a light powder or dampen it for heavier coverage.  Shades are extremely forgiving.  I have more of a natural oil that peaks through during the day. I had no idea about skin prep, primers,  etc. when I started wearing this 30 years ago. I used the sponge that came with it. I stopped wearing it because it was clinging to the fine hairs on my face as I've gotten older.  I was ignorant to the technique of just using a setting spray and tapping into the skin with a wet sponge.  But, it works  well.  It's very good over bigger pores and T-zones.  It wears un-noticeably throughout the day if you tend to touch your face. I feel it's too heavy over a liquid.  I use it for fast makeup looks.",3
"You do not get any makeup.  You have to bring this to a store, pick your shade and then you get your makeup.  This basically is your coupon to get your shade at the store for free.  I returned mine, as I don't have a Sephora store near me to turn this in to.",3
"You guys! This stuff tho! I have super super super dry skin especially in the undereye area so I was pretty excited to receive this concealer gratis from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I do still have to really prep and moisturize my undereye area but once that's done this stuff glides on and pats in like butta! I've never had a concealer that was truly able to do both jobs, take care of under eye issues AND cover blemishes or hyperpigmentation in other areas. I have shade 5 which is medium neutral and it is PERFECT for a bit of brightening in the undereye area as well as providing great coverage for dark marks, melasma or zits! My previous fav was Tarte Shape Tape but that did cake up under my eyes after an hour or so. Not this bad boy! Love it! Great price point and terrific shade range too!",3
"You have to apply this on your cheeks and not just swatch it to appreciate how absolutely pretty it is. On the pan it looks like it has tons of micro glitter, but if you apply it on your cheeks (carefully building up the color), the glitter does not really show. It gives a nice shimmer which is not over the top. Very nice colors too. ❤️❤️❤️",2
"youI wanted to love this mask because of all the hype about it and because I love most other Tatcha products I've tried (and I've tried pretty much all of their best-sellers.) There is enough serum in this packet that you could get at least 2 (maybe 3) uses out of it if you have extra cotton masks or use the leftovers as a serum (which is what I did.) The first day I used it my skin looked amazing and it didn't feel tacky or oily and my skin soaked it up. I even noticed that in pictures from that night I used it my skin and makeup looked flawless! The next day I started noticing some seriously huge pimples and clogged pores. Just to be sure I waited a few days and then used the remaining serum from the packet as a serum under my moisturizer (tatcha water cream, which NEVER breaks me out) and same thing...clogged pores and pimples out of nowhere. It's really a shame because before the break-out my skin looked so smooth and glowy. Maybe if nothing never breaks you out, give it a try. Definitely would not recommend this for anyone who is acne-prone.",2
You know that slightly damp and clean feeling you get after you've used a good toner? You won't get that feeling with this one. I felt like I was rubbing my cotton pad over my face. I'm glad I got a few of these as samples and that I didn't invest my money in this. Not sure how it made it to the Allure list.,0
"you'll look glowy alright. you'll look like a grease ball. the product never dried down so I spent the day shiny and sticky. worst of all it also broke me out, but that is not a surprise at all. i did end up saving the bottle because the spritzer gives the best fine mist I've ever experienced. this is the 2nd tatcha product to break me out, maybe my skin just doesnt like this brand...",4
"You maybe saying to yourself ""Hm...do I get the origin version of this or the waterproof?"" The answer is get the waterproof. Both formulas are lovely and will give you some serious length, but this formulation is somehow better. I think it's less gloppy, for lack of a better word, than the original. I wear contacts as well and it's caused me no issues. really love this mascara.",4
"You need to be careful with The Ordinary products. Seek guidance before you buy and use as you might purchase an item that could be harmful. That said, I love their products. Very reasonably priced and they all without exception work as advertised. This one is no exception in that it provided smooth skin and looked great.",3
"Yup, I said it. Zero stars. I really love Tarte as a brand and gravitated to this particular foundation because it is formulated to dry skin by a cruelty-free brand. Now, I know that Tarte is not the only one to meet those specifications, but I have been using the blush for years and way back in the day also used the Amazonian Clay foundation with no issues so I thought this would be much the same. Boy, was I wrong. I loved it the first couple days. I tried it out for a week, and on Saturday morning exactly a week later I woke up with cystic acne. I have never had an acne problem in my life, not even as a teenager, and now I look like I'm 13 and in the midst of puberty. Not a good look at 30. \n\nDo not buy this. It's a beautiful girl with an ugly heart.",0
"Yup... this is a budget buster :) but it has been on my wish list since it came out and I finally took the plunge!  I love it!  I bought a very flimsy LED mask a while ago because I thought this was way too crazy expensive but the straps never fit and after using it for a few weeks I didn't see any changes. I bought this mask 3 weeks ago and can already see that my skin looks clearer!  I have almost 60 year old, oily/combination skin with huge pores, slight crow's feet and a few spots of discoloration.  I didn't realize how dull my skin was until I started using this mask. I love it and at 3 minutes a day it definitely fits my regime.  The mask is beautifully made and I love that there are both blue and red lights (I use both).  Highly recommend!",3
"Zero Effect after using the serum and the brightening moisturizer. What a waste of $200! if you still want to try this brand, buy the collagen serum and antiaging cream. those two hydrate skin pretty good",0
Zero star! .... what in there made our skin worst ?. Please CLINIQUE LAB dont make us a rat. I been using clinique skin standard for 40 yrs . Some products did give irritation but so far in history most of the anti aging line always gives negative answer. Anyway this horrible cream does worst to skin. Stop it . No further explanation,3
