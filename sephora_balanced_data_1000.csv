"5 out of 5. As soon as I put this on, I am in a better mood. I Love the feel of it, I Love the smell, it's not overly scented, I Love the color. I will be buying this to add to christmas gifts this year. Definately worth it for a lip balm that can make you feel pampered.",0
"A bit spendy, but so is most of Fresh's line. And like most of the products from Fresh, it is high luxury and high quality. The packaging is always gorgeous. The bar itself if quite large and will last a long time. It is a very moisturizing formula that leaves the skin super soft. My only complaint is that the beautiful Sugar scent is a bit too faint.",1
"About 3 mos ago, I was looking for an emollient eye cream that wouldn't cause irritation to my eyes. Many of the new creams contain ingredients that cause red, itchy patches around my eyes. I picked up a few samples in the store, and the Shiseido Benefiance eye cream was the bomb! The skin around my eyes became noticably softer and more hydrated. I went back to the store for something else, and one of the sample choices was the face cream in the same line. I took that home, and discovered that it had the same effect on my face and neck. When I get up in the morning, my skin feels soft and smooth but not greasy or sticky. My makeup lasts better during the day - again, it looks hydrated and smooth, but the makeup doesn't slide off my face. I am a very satisfied customer and will continue to use this product. I will probably even expand my use of this line to other products.",4
Absolutely amazing is what this cream is. I adore the blush it leaves with me and my skin texture is smoother. The sunblock added is an extra bonus allowing me to skip a step by while providing protection with the moisturizer. ,4
Absolutely love it --i've been using this product for about 4 years. Sometimes it can feel a little greasy but that quickly goes away. It makes your skin feel silky and really makes your concealer go on smoothly.,1
"Absolutely love this product. I have very dry skin (esp hands which are so dry from hand washing that they crack) and chicken skin. I used it in conjunction with the Sephora gloves overnight, and within 2 uses my hands were the softest they have ever been since I was a kid. I have noticed the chicken skin effect on my upper arms has started to lighten (after about 2 weeks of nightly use), and hope that this trend continues. However, even if it doesn't, my hands alone make this product worth it's very expensive price.",0
"Absolutely love this product! Keeps your skin smooth, shine free, & minimizes pores all day. I have very fair skin, & was a little skeptical of the color of product, but I think it work with all complections",2
"Absolutely plumps your lips. Only a slight sting to it. I also use the LipFusion Lip Plump, but I have not noticed a dramatic plumping difference between the two products. It feels the same. I will say, I have found with continuous use, it does cause my lips to dry out, and get a little chapped. ",2
"Absolutely, positively LOVE this stuff. I got ""Dolly"" as a free Beauty Insider gift with one of my purchases and just can't seem to get enough of it. It pretty much goes with any lipstick and looks great alone too. It stays on and stays strong. And the peppermint tingle is pleasant, but not too distracting. Love, love, love it! I can't wait to get some of the other colors!",1
"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING ON EARTH. The first time I smelled it I went nuts trying to find out what it was. I was the new girl in the office and I would smell this amazingly sweet, light and airy fragrance from the corner office. I really drove me nuts for the first two months. Then, I moved into the corner office, and found the forgoten bottle in the desk....and I've been an addict ever since. It's a great pick up line too......",1
"Actually, a great color palette for the price. All the colors look great on my skin tone and they're all the perfect shade of that color. I didn't care much for the brushes so good thing I have my own, especially the lip gloss brush. And my lip glosses were just fine. Good buy! ",0
"Adequate as overnight treatment, but way too heavy and rich for daywear. It leaves a greasy feeling even when applied in tiny amounts and it is difficult to apply makeup over this. The original Hope in a Jar is a much better product in my view and I will be sticking with a tried and true product. ",4
"A few shades darker than Nars' O-word (they won't let me type it!) , this shade is perfect for my olive skin tone. It blends in rich and creamy, which is great because it helped me get over my fear of using blush. It's also not too glittery, so I don't feel like I'm looking anything other than natural and vibrant.",1
A firend who has done some local modeling recommended this to me a few years ago and I fell in love with it. It does everything that it says it does! I have kept buying this product every since and will continue.,4
"A friend gave this to me because she said it didn't work for her. I tried it and instantly fell in love! I use it over top of my moisturizer and I truly noticed a difference in the appearance of my pores. It truly matti-fys your skin and prepares your skin for foundation (of any sort - I've used my mineral foundation, as well as my liquid to powder foundation and it works well with both) I've raved about it so much that the friend who gave it to me has been convinced to give it another try. I know I'm not the only one who's become a Pores No More convert - if you're looking for a great pore minimizer / foundation primer, this is the one you're after!",2
"A friend had been telling me to try Ojon, so I started with a kit. Pretty amazing stuff. I've had coworkers ask me what I'm doing differently to my hair to keep it shiny and less suseptible to the weather. The small bottles actually lasted a long time because you don't have to use much. ",4
"A friend introduced me to this product and it makes my make-up set so much better. However, because of the pump mechanism, there is a ton of wasted primer leftover in the bottle that you cannot reach with the pump. I took the bottle apart and pump off and it doesn't really pour out. I will not buy another pump bottle. My recommendation is to purchase the travel size which comes in a tube until the design flaw is remedied.",1
"a friend of mine recommended i try this sent, and i did, and i must say, i love it! its really sweet, but not overpowering. it has a vanilla/cotton candy smell to it. i love the smell, and it lasts all day! deffinantly for the younger croud, i recommend it for ages 16-30.",0
"A friend recommended this to me & let me try hers. My skin felt so nice after using it and I didn't feel like I had a ton of stuff all over my face. The All Over Face Color is a bit dark and takes some practice to make it look natural, but the practice is worth it! ",2
"After achieving just the right look, I try to complete the look with the perfect finishing touch. Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder goes on silky smooth with just the right coverage to give the overall image seen on models perfect complexions. There is enough sheen to give mature skin the radiance often lost with age an gives me a natural finish.",2
After all the hype must say I was disappointed... but I know everyones skin is different. Yes it is lightweight and it did hydrate mildly but saw no difference in fine lines after two months use. Still searching for hydrating and line filler/smoother. ,3
"After all the ranting and raving about Nars Orgasm, I went out and bought a compact. I have to say that while the formula is moisturizing for a powder, and long lasting, there is nothing about the actual color that really sets it apart. The color looks exactly like Cargo's Tonga on my skin. And the shimmer in it was unexpected, so I tend to use it higher on my cheekbones to highlight my other blush.",1
"After a long search for the perfect foundation primer, I stumbled onto the Photo Finish Light Foundation Primer. It's lightweight, goes on smoothly, and keeps my t-zone oil from rearing its ugly head!! I never let myself run out of this product.",2
"After applying this I tend to get acne/pumps on the forhead at the end of the day. It is a little bit greasy and heavy, prefer moisturizing gel from Clingue. However, it will be perfect for people who has dry skin. ",0
"after a visit to a nearby Sephora, a spoke to the sales girl and told her of my search for the perfect dark red...I came home with a very bright Marilyn Monroe red...not what I was looking for. I took a gamble on this lipstick online and am I glad I did. Not only is the color exactly what I wanted, but it is long lasting and not at all drying. ",3
"after being repeatedly disappointed by other foundation primers, i finally gave photo finish a try, and now i cant live without it! its the only one i've ever used that doesn't leave my skin feeling slightly oily, and its made my makeup look so much smoother and go on so much easier! i love, love, love this product!",1
"After, close to 3 months the difference is clear. My skin is much MUCH smoother, tight and firm. I get a better shave now too. I love, love, LOVE the scent. It is very smoothing and is apart of my nighttime routine. ",1
"After complimenting friends on how great their blush looks, I found out that it was Nars and I had to get it for myself. Now I am getting the compliments! I have fair skin and a little goes a long way. You can add more for evening for a more dynamic effect. Last all day or night.",1
"After finding this, I will no longer waste anymore time or money on liquid self tanners. I've tried them all (Estee Lauder, Origins, BE, all the drug store brands). This product goes on beautifully and I get so many compliments on my tan. It has a lovely sparkle to it and the colors look like a real beach tan. No icky smell, no worries about making sure the application goes on without streaks or missed spots, no high maintenance issues that you have with liquids washing off. This is a perfect product! ",3
"After hearing rave reviews from others with so-called sensitive, acne-prone skin, I decided to try this serum. Initially it was fine but within a week it was as if I had reddish-brown chemical burns on my face! It took months to correct. I will never touch this stuff again! I guess my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive because I know other people swear by it. ",2
"After I bought this product I found myself thinking... do I really ""need"" something like this? But let me tell you it was a life saver this summer!!! First of all it can be used on face AND body wich makes it nice to pack for cottaging, camping ect... Secondly it's all natural so it makes me feel like I'm doing something good for my skin, and last but not least it's super hydrating yet feels light on the skin, has a cooling calming feel and aroma AND I truly believe that applying it right after sun exposure has saved me from some possibly brutal burns.",0
"After I turned 37, I began to get acne. At first it would appear around the onset of my mothly cycle. After awhile, I was plagued with it. I tried many, many different brands and I stumbled across MD Skin Care. I thought the All-Over Blemish Solution was pricey, but I did not have acne even when I went through puberty so I was desperate to try anything. After using the system within a couple of days I could see a difference in my skin. No more bumps not even during that time of the month and the All-Over Blemish Solution lasts for some time. Now I won't go without this line of products! ",2
"After losing my lashes due to an autoimmune disorder, I thought NOTHING would work. THIS DOES! I use it 1-2 xs day and NOW actually have lashes! I use on my brows too with good results as well. I thought nothing would work and it was all hype, IT'S NOT! I gave it four because It does kind of run into my eyes when applying, but it might just be me using too much. ",4
"after previously giving a bad review of this product as one that did not work, I woke up a few days ago with EYEBROWS! Gee, I have never been so glad to have been wrong about a product. The outer portions of my eyebrows have been gone for some time and now they are BACK.! ",4
"After reading about Fiberwig in a beauty mag, I immediately ordered some from Sephora. I used it every day, and didn't find it any better than any other mascara in terms of longer, fuller lashes. And I did get some clumps. I'm still looking for the perfect mascara for me. ",4
"after reading all the fantastic reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try. After only 5 uses i saw and incredible difference in the appearance of my pores. Now don't expect pores to totally abandon your face in 3 days because this product needs about 1 week to really start working-So worth the price!!",0
"After reading ALL the great reviews on this,I decided to give it a try.It is a very nice mascara..long wearing,and comes off with soap and water.Nice brush too.A little expensive,but I cant find any product that does a better job at defining my lashes. ",2
"After reading all the great reviews on this lip gloss I decided to buy it. I chose Trixie and I absolutely love it. There is not a lot of color to it, although it looks like there should be from the bottle, but it is not sticky at all and the plumping sensation is NOT stinging- more like a cool, peppermint sensation. I have full lips already so I could not tell if this really ""plumps"" but I do like the scent, the feel, and the color. The only thing better would be with an SPF!",2
"After receiving (and trying) the shower gel & body lotion samples, I fell in love with this scent. I bought this in the Sephora store immediately! I get SO MANY compliments when I wear it. Some scents I only wear in one particular season but this one I will wear all year round!! ",3
"After searching for some time, I stumbled on this product along with the other Poreless products, that was in late July. I have loved several of Dr. Brandt's products in this line, and this moisturizer is one of them. For combo, sensitive and aging skin this have been perfect. I use it in the morning after using the poreless cleanser. Afterwards I always put on the pores no more cream. The moisterizer and the pores no more are my favorites... half the time I don't bother with base after that. As the season changes, we are getting much drier weather in CA. I still am happy with it but have found I need something more moisturizing on really bad Santa Ana wind days. ",3
"After some practice, this is a great product. The epilator is my FAVORITE (I use it on my underarms and haven't shaved in months)! A little painful, but worth it and easy to get used to. The shaver is pretty basic; the plastic guards that fit over the shaver are not really what I want to use, but I can see them being helpful to someone else. Overall, worth the money, especially if you hate shaving (like me). ",0
"After struggling to find the best shade of blush for me, I found it in Orgasm. The soft pink/peach shade with a hint of shimmer works beautifully with my pale/fair skin. The Sephora Blush Brush makes application so easy.\nThis will definitely be a staple in my make up bag.",2
"After the award winning entrance that this blush makes in ""orgasm"" I was ready to return it before it got here! Not a disappoiment at all! Beautiful, natural, longlasting color that goes well with my Bare Minerals Medium Tan Foundation. Absolutely love it and also bought lip gloss!",3
"After the hype, I expected great things form this mascara. It lengthens nicely, but already the second coat tends to clump and the clumps are almost impossible to get rid of with mascara remover, I literally had to pull them out. Won't buy again.",4
"After trying my first one, I immediately ordered a second one. I had my daughter try mine and she ordered one immediately too. Very pretty on as well as soothing. It will replace lip balm for me this winter. More fun to wear. I expect to end up with one in each color by adding one or more to each Sephora order I place. They have a great taste. I just feel prettier wearing it. My lips are smoother and fuller, never looked better. ",4
After trying this the first night - I was surprised. I had a little bump beginning - just could feel it under the skin. I applied the product as directed and the next morning - that bump was gone. I am 60 years old and never had acne - I was surprised at how fast this worked IF it was indeed the product. ,4
"After using Philosophy's Purity Made Simple for a year, I finally decided to try something new. My skin is really sensitive, so a Sephora associate recommended Caudalie's Instant Foaming Cleanser. WOW! I love the foamy texture, and the pretty light scent. It rinses off clean without drying my face out. The added plus? I stopped breaking out so much! I used to have a zit or two pop up every few days, but now I don't! I will be using this product for as long as they'll make it.",1
"After wanting to try any Philosophy produc for years, I finally decided to treat myself, and being almost 50,I figured this Firming Cream would be the product to buy!!! I am so happy with this,the smell is so clean and fresh and last all day long, and my skin feels fantastic...I definately will continue with this product!",3
"After years of being a faithful and enthusiastic CHI user, I hesitated to purchase the ghd styling iron. Much to my amazement, it does a much better job of straitening my hair than my old fave, the CHI! The ghd is easy to heats quickly, is easy to use and really tames my frizzy head. ",3
"After years of struggling with skin problems I discovered these mini peel pads and life has not been the same since. I rarely, if ever, get blemishes anymore (unless I run out and then those pesky bumps start returning in a day or so) and my skin is positively glowing all the time. The texture of my skin is smoother and softer than ever and I find these pads useful for the occasional blemishes that may happen on other body parts as well. Worth every penny you spend for them and the results are amazing. ",2
"again, Juice has packed their eye cream with wonderful, natural ingredients. while this cream was not excessively firming, which I why I left off a star, it IS very moisturizing and smoothing. it feels pleasant on the skin, and never irritated my sensitive eye area. it absorbs completely so it does not affect eye makeup. although light in nature, it is very concentrated and, though this isn't really important, smells heavenly. a great all-around performing cream. would purchase this cream again. ",2
"A gal in Sephora recommended this to me to help with my pores and dull skin. I used it once a week or every other week and it does what it says it does! My skin is very sensitive so I can't use anything harsher, but I don't need to! ",2
"A girl is surely to find the right shade of blush with the fabulous selection available. I love that the blush is so sheer that if you make a bit of a mess - no big deal. However, I find that Ihave to re-apply it in the afternoon.",2
A girl is sure to find the right shade of Nars blush with the fabulous selection available. The blush is nice and sheer so even if you brush it on quickly and make a little mess it's no big deal. The only draw back is that I've noticed it's almost gone by the afternoon and I have to re-apply.,2
A good but gentle waterproof mascara (& makeup) remover. I have very sensitive eyes and have not found a remover that does the job until I tried Double Swish. The dispenser in the cap is great for getting just the right amount of product...leaks a bit when shaken though. ,3
"A great collection for the holidays. The ruby shades compliment any complexion and eye color. The Ruby Radiance all over face color gives a real healthy and happy glow, and it seems to reflect the light and give you a real dewy look. The bag is too nice to use as a makeup bag it is going out on the town with me. ",4
"a great idea for bare minerals, which is hard to take with you, this compact offering falls short of convenience by supplying sub par brushes and too big packaging. Powders and lip gloss still great value though ",2
"A great little compact, all the colors are compatable. I was wary of using a black eyeshadow ,but wanted to try a smoky eye. The black shadow in this kit is soft,shimmery and easy to layer to desired intensity. The silver is a nice hithlighter, and the blush and lip glosses are perfect, love it! ",3
"A great little set - the colors are sheer and shiny, goes with everything, and most days I only use sunscreen, eyebrow definer and/or mascara and one of these glosses. Wish they were back in stock so I could order another set! :) ",2
"A great product. Instantly gives you that all-over glow with a natural finish. Definitely gives you a 'child-like freshness, but makes me feel a little too youthful sometimes - with the glittery effect you can get with this product. Better for a night-time, going out to a party make-up, than a day-time product. But that's just my opinion.",4
"A great shadow, but the shimmer in these shadows is a little to intense for a simple day look. For a dramatic night look however, i suggest oil slick and midnight cowboy rides again. Both are VERY shimmery. Try the matte UD shadows for day. ",0
"A great substitute if you cannot afford to buy the perfume, which I love. Very nice size for traveling and taking with you. It's a tiny bit messy (the powder does tend to over coat and fly out of the brush), but well worth it for the wonderful silky softness and scent. ",2
"A great volumizing mascara that doesn't clump! I am very picky when it comes to mascaras, and I fell in love with the BADgal Lash. It's thick but not clumpy. One coat of this and that's all you need for amazing lashes. I have very sensitive eyes and I love how it doesn't crumble and flake in your eyes!",1
"Ahh, the never-ending brow struggle. I found that the little brush is not great for applying the color for me personally. So I used an eyeliner smudger tool instead, and that was much better. Both colors are great, though I favor the lighter color, which is perfect for dark blonde/light brown hair. The brush is fine for applying the wax. I've gotten several compliments since I've started using this product. ",1
"A huge Bare Minerals devotee, I bought this kit long after I had purchased several others. While the other kits are fun and vibrant, this one is incredibly versatile. Though the blush looks to be cotton candy pink, it's very sheer and subtle. The eyecolors are perfect and classy. I love that the Cream Soda color is matte. On my light skin, it makes for a flawless, smooth-looking base. Then the Rapture goes right in the crease and looks sophistocated and classy. I use the Tiger's Eye liner with almost all my shadows now. I sure hope I can buy it individually when it runs out. That's the best thing about BE, though. Everything lasts a long time because it takes so little to look gorgeous. The double-ended brush is wonderful for achieving the base color and crease color effect. I cannot now live without the angled blush brush. I use it with all my BE blushes, and it works fabulously. I finally have a natural-looking blush instead of colored cheeks with definite borders. The set is worth it for the Sugar Buxom lip polish. It's a great shade that compliments any complexion. Yes, these are all minis. But, as I said, they last a long time because a little goes a long way. The small size also makes them very portable. This is my go-to set anytime I'm going out of town, because I know it will compliment any look I try to achieve. ",1
"A little goes a long way. And when you are done, your skin says ""ahhhh.""\nI had heard great things about Purity Made Simple and was not disappointed. It is not a soapy cleanser but it truly does cleanse. No heavy smell but my skin feels cleaner after I use it. Also great when you need a quick makeup remover and cleanser in one.",2
"A little heavily fragranced for my taste, but the scent fades as it dries. To get serious volume requires multiple applications, so it's a little more work than it's worth. Does flake easily. Not much for lengthening, but it doesn't promise much in that department. ",3
"A little more coverage would have been nice. i am assuming that since it is tinted, it is for a small about of coverage. The oil sucking power of this is great though. I use it under my bare minerals. It is nice after your moisturizer if your moisturizer leaves you sticky. Especially if you use mineral foundation.",2
"A little piece of morning bakery in your shower how can anything go wrong. Now if they would just make a coffee line - I would be hooked forever. This is the best scrub I ever had - it washs off and there is no left over residue. Also, there is no lingering smell - so once your done with your shower the Cake Batter smell is in your bathroom and not on your skin. ",3
a little pricey but you offered a special coupon so I thought I would treat myself.......great radiance natural glow..no greasy shine..the age spots do seem to be getting lighter..I use 3 drops in the am and 3 in the pm.. you just feel that you have to option as to if you want to put make up on or go with out...i would give it the highest rating.,4
"All beauty junkies know we need gloves for hand treatment. There are gloves and then there are NICE gloves. These are NICE gloves! They are soft, do not shrink, and are very comfortable. I use them overnight with my favorite hand cream. An added bonus is that I don't get my hand cream on my face during the night, so no more breakouts from that. I need to get a second pair so that I always have clean ones! ",4
All I can say is these flavors are incredible!! The only reason this gets 4 stars is that the scent does not last much longer than the shower or tubbie but for many people that might be a good thing... Dark chocolate smells like you have just wandered into a European chocolate cafe... and the milk chocolate made me want to eat the loads of suds!! Best of all - NO calories!! ,2
"All I can say is wow. I have always had trouble with makeup not staying on for more than an hour. Make Up For Ever is just that..forever. I have extremely sensitive skin, especially the eyelids and I have no problem wearing their makeup. In addition their color choices are great. ",4
All I can say is wow. This is my newest fav find! I have not been able to find a hand cream that ever even really felt like it was doing anything. I have only been using it a couple days but can already feel and SEE a difference. I highly recommend this to everyone! P.s. Wish they would do something about the smell of this though... bleh. Am getting the lavender immediately! ,2
"All my life I've had oily skin and could never get eyeshadows to last, even the ""crease-resistant"" ones always went straight to my crease within a few hours. Using this I can put on ANY type of eyeshadow/shimmer and it will last all day & sometimes even 2! It keeps the colors bright as the look before/after application. Sometimes it helps last longer if you let it sit on your lids for a few seconds. I love the bottle it comes in! Totally worth the price! ",0
"All of the colors in this pallette are very wearable , no glittery colors, just long wearing, slightly shimmery, basic colrs that look great with my brown eyes- grey,green, brown,taupe and plum, with a matte yellow based all over color! ",3
"All Sephora products are reasonably priced, as is this one. It does a good job without stinging and it doesn't have a lot of oil to blur your vision. My one wish is that the opening would be large enough to insert a q-tip. I do not use cotton balls to remove mascara. I use 1 q-tip per eye...It's cheaper and it works better--no rubbing. I'm hoping some day they will change the opening. Thank you. ",4
All the colors are fantastic. This is a great pallette good for most skins tones. I love this!!! the only bummer is the that the applicators are as cheap as you can get and literally fall apart on the first use. ,3
"All these colors are beautiful, plus more bang for your buck with 16 colors. Just wish Uzi was in this, but an overall great buy. The colors are highly pigmented, some are for day, some are for night, a great variety in my opinion. Just make sure you use a primer to make the colors last longer and to prevent creasing. ",1
A lot of people seem to like this product but it is just ok for my combination skin. The cleanser feels very light and it's super gentle. However I don't feel that it is very deep cleaning at all. I mainly use it on weekends when i'm not wearing a lot of makeup. I really like it as a eye makeup remover though. It is that gentle and it doesn't sting my eyes at all. I also really like using it with my clarisonic brush. The combination is baby smooth skin.,1
"Alright I figured pricey brush, great results. I mean it has to be better than the 8.00 one I got at the local drug store, right? Other than the bristles lasting longer and it seems to hold heat a bit better...but really that's about it. Not knocking it exactly but I am not sure it's worth the price either. ",1
"Although described as ""revoluntionary,"" I didn't notice much, if any, difference when i used this product to tame my wavy hair prior to blow drying and flat ironing. It seemed comparable to the various silicone products available, although the texture is more akin to a gel than a liquid. ",3
Although I am a amazing grace girl I find myself going back and fourth with pure grace.... the clean scent blows my mind but the scent does not last at all.... So I have to keep on spraying all day but its ok because the scent is that wonderful.,1
"Although I do prefer Sephora's lip gloss pencil over Stila's Lip Glaze pencil, it's still only acceptable. It's easy to use, non-sticky, pigmented and convenient, but I find it rather drying on my lips. A great concept. Maybe it just didn't work for me. Definitely worth a try. ",0
"Although I have been using their skincare line for almost a year, this was my first time trying the bath line. I was not disappointed. The smell is wonderful...a true caramel apple scent. It is rich yet not overpowering. I also like that it doesn't linger on your skin after you dry off. I don't want a scent that interferes with my perfume. I plan to buy more soon because of its limited-edition status. A wonderful fall indulgence! ",2
"Although it looks very bright, depending on how much you brush on can it can go from day to night the glitter is very lite. I love this and it is going to become a staple in my makeup bag, and it makes my brown eyes pop ",2
"although the name mildew, may throw some people off, this is by far one of the nicest shades of green I have ever seen. Its like an emerald color and I constantly get compliments about it. I pair it with maui wowie for a great look ",1
"Although this product did seem to smooth out my skin and made my foundation apply more evenly, it also made me break out and itch. I have extremely sensitive skin so I wasn't surprised by this reaction - it was still a bummer that I can't use the product.",2
"Always hesitant to try new lipsticks, I decided to take a chance on this one! I saw a color I loved in one of the flyers I got, and had to have it! It goes on so smoothly, and the color is true! Love this stuff!",2
AMAAAAZING! i have oily combination skin. and enlarged pores have always been an issue. after just a few days i can already see DRAMATIC results. love the microdelivery peel. works wonders. hope in a jar smells a little but it works! and OH MY..the microdelivery face wash...best thing ever!! ,0
"Am a big fan of Laura Mercier face makeup and have used Secret Concealer for several years. A little goes a long way, so I use a LM concealer brush to apply it sparingly over a good base like Clinique All About Eyes. Covers circles, reduces 'hollow' look, and doesn't separate or crease during the work day.",4
"A makeup eraser is one thing I can't live without. I've used others I like better but this one does work well, however it tends to be a tiny bit oily. I like the size of the pen itself, it's easy to grip and control. ",4
"amazing flavor, pretty color,not sticky- simply one of the best lip shines yet! always liked the lemonade, but this is a new favorite for the holidays for the beautiful shade of red. there is no excuse for dry lips when a product this fun to use is available! the body wash is heaven also! ",3
"Amazing grace firming body emulsion is the best after shower moisturizer I have yet to use. The scent is wonderful and makes my skin feel softer, more supple and years younger than my age. Used in conjunction with the Amazing Grace bath and shower gel and the perfume the scent lingers all day. I am complimented freguently about how good I smell. Sometimes I find myself sniffing my own arm, I smell so good.",4
"Amazing Grace is by far the best scent I have ever found for me. It truly is a soft, clean floral scent that just grabs me and lifts my spirits no matter what. The shower gel is very true to the fragrance scent. The scent is soft, and it does not last all day, but it is a nice layering piece with the perfume. Also, it is like any other Philosophy shower gel I have tried. It lathers very well, and a little goes a long way.",1
"AMAZING! I have tan skin already, but this really gives an extra glow during the summer/helps in the winter! It's very natural looking, applies well with a different brush!!! (throw the one it comes with away! it leaves streaks..) You can also contour your face with this. Perfect. ",0
"Amazing! I love Smashbox and Sephora and shop a lot! Every single item in the kit is great...the brush, the cute bag..the gold shimmer powder I use for eyes, cheeks, hair, lips......it lasts. The eyeliner is the best color of brown, it doesn't sting the eyes, I just love the lip gloss, and it lasts for a lip gloss. I hope Smashbox makes more kits like this! ",2
"Amazing makeup remover!i I tried sooo many and they all didn't live up to their name and $$$ i spend in the past - but his one is perfect even for sensitive skin. I can remove all from make up, lipstick up to the hardest - mascara!!It removes everything very easy and you don't have to use much at all! Try it - small bottle if you are not sure to start with! ",2
"AMAZING!!! Not only does this cream smell good but it takes care of the ache and the calluses that come with wearing those really great shoes we all love. Not greasy just yummy. Couldn't believe the difference in my ""Barney Rubble"" feet after just 1 day! Don't get weird with the price tag. It lasts forever and your honey will no longer look at your feet with that ""OMG are those your feet look.""",4
Amazing product. I have never found a better moisturizer. It smells great and works even better. The only one i will use. It is not greasy but provides superior moisturizing. In the winter this is the only thing that works on my legs. ,1
Amazing product! I thought I shouldn't even bother wasting my time putting on eyeliner this summer (as soon as I put it on the humidity would start taking it off. Then I tried Aqua Eyes! I bought one for each of my daughters too. ,4
"Amazing product. I use it for a concealer and for eye shadow base. What I love about these products is that they go on so fast and they stay on! I've tried many, many products in my life and this is truly the best I've ever found!",4
"An artist is only as good as the tools used and this basic buffling, blending Brush is a basic must! May be used with any powder products to set and blend... gives a sheer airbrushed finish... never grabs... does not shed... long lasting and easy to clean. Great value as it lasts a looong time. ",4
"Anastasia's Perfect Brow Pencil is as close to perfect as you can get in a brow pencil. It is soft and doesn't leave any harsh unnatural looking strokes where I've filled in. The little spooly brush on the end is a handy feature, too. This is a great pencil.",2
"Anastasia's Perfect Brow Pencil is so easy to use, and comes in colors that can match any eyebrow shade! I originally bought this pencil in Strawburn when I changed my hair color from blonde to red, and even though the red pencil doesn't match my blonde eyebrows, it STILL looks perfectly real. No one has ever looked at me and said ""But what color was your hair before?"" The pencil is easy to sharpen and apply, and the spooley brush on the other end makes mistakes disappear and blending a snap.",0
"An awakening spiced lemon scent. The soft lather invigorates your senses. Soapy Sap is more than a body cleanser but a harmonious blend of scent, lather and moisture. A wonderful reason to get up and jump in the shower! ",2
"An awesome formula that WILL NOT smudge with mineral makeup use, and it is SUPER easy to remove. The only dislike of the product is with the fibers that fall off and onto your face and onto the eyelids. I found the fibers to be very annoying and time consumming as a Virgo - always checking the mirror to remove them. ",2
"An effective and easy-to-use product. I use short strokes of a stiff 1/8"" brush to brush the powder (in taupe to match my brown hair) onto my brows. I then use my finger to smooth the wax over the brows, from nose to the end of the brow. It took a bit of practice, but now I can easily apply these products so that they look natural. This brow tamer is easily removed with eye makeup remover. ",2
"A nice, simple two-step system, very easy to use. I see finer pores and a more even skin tone with regular daily use. The solution is mild and caused no skin irritation, only clear, glowing complexion. Happiness is fine skin. ",3
"An interesting scent has been infused into my favorite hand mositurizer. This stuff packs a whollup. A pea sized amount is all you need and your hands will heal, if chapped, be softer and retain moisture. I love love love this product. The scent truly reminds me of the holidays for some reason. A little flowery, a little sweet, but not overwhelming at all. ",1
"Another great Caudalie product with a great scent! Basically what interested me in this brand is the key grape ingredient--you know it's natural and it smells good too! This is a different, exotic type of scent that is refreshing and good for your skin.",1
"Another great NP product. I love the colors. I have 3 so far with the other 7 on the way. The 3 I received blend easily and pigmentation is great so far. Not a lot of glitter, but I prefer matte and satin eyeshadows anyway. I also like the fact they have the color on the bottom instead of a number. Also cute packaging. ",2
"Another great scent from Phil. This product has a sheen that brightens the skin (no lie!). I'm usually a skeptic about moisturizers - this one starts working fast! In a few days, I could feel my cheeks getting softer. Good price, because a little goes a long way. If you're bored with moisturizers or tired of dropping a bundle and being disappointed, try ""Hope."" ",3
Another one of Stila's baked products. It gives you a lovely natural flush look when you swirl both colours and apply. Or you can contour and highlight your cheek bones with it. It is easy to blend and lasts a long time. ,1
"Any and all Too Faced eyeshadows are WORTH THE MONEY!! You wont be disappointed!!!! Plus, unlike many brands, you can see the color through the top so you dont have to open the stupid thing to see which color it is. ",2
a perfect summer scent. I wish this product had a body wash and body lotion. This scent is hard to find. But this is the most wonderful non-super -sweet cool summer scent. It is a refreshing scent that does not over power. ,3
Applied over tinted moisturizer and under transluscent Mineral Veil it looks like my complexion did when I was 16. Natural. Like after a brisk walk in the spring. The cheek color blends with all complexions and looks good on the lips too! Looks way better on aging skin than powder blushes. ,4
"Appropriately enough, I was given this fragrance as a present picked out by a little girl. It's a yummy, chocolatey scent, sweet and insouciant. I've received plenty of compliments on it. I don't recommend it for people over 30 or so as it's quite young, and it's always struck me as more of a daytime scent. ",0
"Area is a glamorous eye pencil. My mother (51) and I (29) both wear this black pencil. On my mother, it is soft and awakens her eyes, they appear brighter. On me, it is edgy and very much rock and roll. ",1
"a really nice blush. goes on true to color, and stays on for a long period of time! it's really smooth and easy to blend. i just wear powder or bronzer underneath and it looks really nice. a worthwhile purchase. i am very light skinned with yellow undertones...and it looks nice on me.",0
Are you kidding!! This is the best product EVER!!! Since I discovered this I simply can not wear eyeshadow without it & I tell every living person that they too must have it. Not one has told me that I was wrong. ,3
"As a fair haired blonde, it is often hard for me to find a red lipstick that is neither too orange nor too scarlet. The Laura Mercier creme lipstick in Truly Red is a perfect shade for me. It is perfect for the holidays, and the deep rich color complements my fair skin. I feel very glamorous wearing it. The lipstick goes on easily and is smooth and creamy and lasts a long time. It leaves my lips soft and hydrated. ",4
"As a fan of LM Tinted Moisturizer's sheer formulation and light, smooth texture, and I was ready to love this new Illuminating verson, expecting it even my skin out, plus add a subtle glow.\nWas not to be!\nThe texture is a lot richer and more pigmented than expected (not at all like a TM, more like a foundation), and much much too shimmery... plus, with only 3 color choices, the palette is very limited for most skin tones (esp. mid -deep).",2
"As a fifty+ woman with eye problems due to RA & macular scarring I have not worn eye makeup in years. After considering makeup tatooing, I purchased the BE Get Started Eyes kit and have found it to be awesome. The instructions make it is very easy to use & the results are very beautiful eyes! ",4
"as a former beauty advisor for a large dept. store, i have tried just about every sort of moisturizing cream, lotion,gel, etc. this is the best body cream- not strongly fragranced, but not medicinal like the fragrance free ones.it is not greasy, absorbs into your dry areas perfectly.gentle enough to use on your face without clogging pores! ",3
"as a huge fan of the green and new fan of night, I love these minis! I keep one stashed in my purse (never know when you'll run into an ex!) , one at my boyfriends place, and one at my moms.. Its so convenient not having to carry around the full size or worry about leaving behind your expensive bottle! ",1
"A salesperson sold me this delightfully fresh smelling spray to use to set my makeup. It does not seem to make any real difference in this way, but it feels really hydrating, so I may use it as a toner/serum and see how that goes. If anyone knows of a product that truly sets makeup, let me know!",3
"As a lotion, this is fairly nice stuff -- rich and moisturizing without feeling too heavy or greasy. As a bronzer or highlighter, the color is sheer and blendable enough to use even on my extremely pale legs, but dark-skinned friends report that it's also shimmery enough to give a nice warm glow on deep complexions, too. It's a very fine-grained shimmer, not a glittery sparkle, so it's perfectly suitable for day wear. Unfortunately, the color isn't waterproof or rubproof, so you need to be careful wearing this with light clothes or in hot/humid climates. I'd give it a higher rating if not for the fragrance -- the scent is a fairly strong synthetic-powdery floral that I didn't care for very much. I'd have preferred a lighter scent that wouldn't clash with my regular fragrances -- mixing this with unscented lotion or sunblock does dilute the scent, but also thins out the shimmery color, too. ",2
"As a make up addict that I am, I test, try and buy many different products. So far, the Too Faced shadows are the easiest to apply, the best to blend and feel soft and silky on my eyes. The duo colors compliment each other well. I have a few but my favorite by far is Fantasy Island. ",1
As a make-up artist I love Bag Gal Lash Mascara! I have used it on tons of people and the result is always the same- Big beautiful lashes! I have blonde lashes and this mascara takes them and makes them look like I'm wearing false lashes! It doesn't flake or dissapear on you in the middle of the day! And everyone that I use it on wants a tube! This is a must have product for everyone!,0
"As an 18 year old young woman, I do not have too much ""baggage"" to cover and no wrinkles! But above my eyes are always redish pink and I do have small dark circles and this is the only product that works for me! I just put a very very light coating and it's like it was never there! Unfortunately, I lost this product because of its small size and simple black packaging! I have to buy a new one ASAP! ",0
"AS an inveterate eye-shadow user, I can testify that Sephora's Colorful Mono Eyeshadow is the best I have ever used and certainly the best for the money. Even if I don't use a primer, it doesn't crease! It seems to include it's own hidden primer, which is a great thing for all of us who love the drama of eyeshadow but don't like the messy look when it starts going South. Also, the color I use (#7) is what I have been searching for, for many years. ",4
"As a perfectly ""picky"" lip color wearer, this is one to add to the perfect list! Long lasting, non-drying, easy-to-use. I only wish there were more colors in the wine family. I will definetley buy this, again. ",3
As a performer I routinely apply red lipstick for performances. She Laq is a an absolute MUST HAVE in my makeup bag. It prevents my russian red lipstick from feathering and smudging. You can practically make out with someone wearing this stuff and your lipstick will stay put! ,1
"As a person who suffers from fragence allergies, I am thrilled to now wear this refreshing ""light"" fragrence that has managed to lighten all my ""blue"" moods because I could not wear other fragrances.",4
"As a professional makeup artist I'm constantly searching for a primer that really works. I discovered ""the veil"" several years ago and nothing else out there even begins to compare in durability, luminosity, and coverage. Leave it to Japanese technology to create a product a product that gives you flawless finish even before you apply a foundation ! ",2
"As a professional makeup artist using this product, I would say this makeup is amazing! The shades are so rich and blend so well together. This makeup is all you need to create amazing eyes! I have all three and plan to keep these in my case! ",0
"As long as you get the color that is most complimentary for your skin tone, you can NOT go wrong with Nars blushes. They are luminous, youthful and very natural looking. If you are unsure go into a Sephora store and ask an attendant to help - this really helped me decide between 2 colors I was considering.",2
"As my title states im in love with this product! i've tried many different mascaras, but i've never had one that gives such great volume and length in one. One day i was using it and realized it was scented! All in all this mascara is great and lasts a long time throughout the day, and doesnt clump when you put on a couple layers, its wonderful! ",0
"As of my last post on 12/22/08 I have some additional info on how to keep the ""odor"" out of the brush belt. I originally put fabric softener in the case before I roll it up...after 3-4 weeks I stopped, because, I thought that it was under control...I was wrong! I started the fabric softener sheets inside, again, & have started washing the outside material with liquid febreeze & a dish towel! So far this treatment has been working! I know that this seems like a lot of work, but, the brush case is REALLY great & has more than enough room for all of my brushes,sponges,etc. I just wanted to update all beauty lovers on my ""solution"" for the odor! Hope that this helps!!! ",2
"As others have said in reviews I was using pro-active and it was drying my skin out terribly and I have oily skin. I was still getting break outs too. I'm 48 and thought the philosophy might just be what my skin needed - clear up the breakouts and not dry out my skin. I bought this kit at Sephora last week and have been amazed by the results. Hopefully, it will continue to work so great. ",3
"As others have said, this set is subtly sparkly. I really love the mid tone eyeshadow, just beautiful I don't know about using the highlighter color all over my face. It is a great blusher for me. I have yet to try the mascara, but the rest of this set is a winner. New brushes are always nice to have! ",3
"As someone who is always on the look out for a new nude lipstick, this is a very good one. It is not blan or too beige, rather on the pink side with peach tones. No chalky look that is so often associated with nudes. It's 'pretty', wearable, full coverage color. Comfortable and it lasts for awhile. I Like my lipsticks a little browner which is why it's a 4 star. But that's another review... ",4
"As soon as I got this product as a ""birthday gift,"" I fell in love with it. The scent is amazing! The bubbles are fantastic. I have a really large tub (80 gallons) and the bubbles were thick and long lasting. Every other bubble bath I have used just didn't create the volume of bubbles or smell. A truly excellent and superior product. ",1
"As soon as I saw this on the Sephora's website, I knew I had to have it. I didn't own any Tarte e/s before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The e/s are all soft & smooth. They're very pigmented, blend easily, & last all day w/o creasing. Not to mention, the palette is a steal. ",0
"As the first one to review this product, I feel it's necessary to speak the absolute truth: You need this! If you love creating multiple looks with versatile shadows of quality, this will be a staple palette that you will always reach for in times of love and war! ",0
"A surprising change from the classic Lauren fragrances. Notorious is a more complex, sophisticated and sensual blend. Eventhough it is marketed as a patchouli musk , you won't smell patchouli-ish. I think if you like Agent Provacateur, or Gaultier, you'll enjoy Notorious! ",3
"as usual, BE has compiled a collection of beautifully coordinating colors at a great value. These are great for fall and the holidays....I love the ruby radiance and the large buxom lip plumping gloss. I wish the mascara were more ""visible"" in that you could actually see the ruby effect, but that's a minor complaint. These brushes are essential if you don't already have them. Overall a great product! ",3
"As with NARS blush, you will keep this compact forever. These are incredible bronzers that, applied in various strengths, can complement any skin tone. I do recommend Laguna exclusively for somewhat dark shades, though, as it is very, VERY brown.",0
"At 52 and finding changes in my skin texture/tone and still occasional belmishes, this product has made a noticable improvement in my skin. Clearer softer skin, fewer blemishes - overall my skin is better. Went to work with only a light tinted moisturizer, and a customer asked if I'd just had a facial. I hadn't; it's this product at work. PTR rpoducts rock and work too. ",3
"At age 63, I'm often worried that products I'd like to have just won't work on a beginning-to-age face. Not so with Smashbox and this kit. What a nice surprise; I absolutely love it. I think this kit is a great ""try me"" kit and well worth the price. I'm so impressed that I've purchased more of the Smashbox line. ",4
"At any given time, I have anywhere from 7 to 12 lip glosses in my purse. It is not an exageration. It is my reality. I am obsessed. In any case, out of the 10 glosses in my purse right now, 5 are Smashbox. I love these because they feel smooth on my lips. My favorite color is Afterglow. Slightly peachy nude, and compliments my skin perfectly. ",1
"At first I didn't like the texture since it wasn't foamy, and that is how I usually like my cleansers. But once I got used to it, I was very impressed with how it got rid of ALL my eye makeup. I don't need a separate makeup remover! It's really awesome, and now it's my favorite cleanser!!",2
"At first I got a sample of this stuff just because It seams like I have tried almost everything to get rid of blemishes in a fashionable time. Seariousley in 2 days breakout gone, and overall complexion totally I think it also prevents acne too. I am definitly going to keep this product around.",0
"At first I thought that the apricot scent wasn't making it. But sitting at work at my computer has proven me wrong. The fig/apricot combination is luscious, and of course, being a FRESH product, the cleaning/moisturizing work it does is top-notch. FRESH is my favorite bath & body company, and their new scent is a definite winner. ",4
"At first I thought this product did not contain the vitamins we're all looking for in our products to keep me looking youthful. I thought it was for teenagers. But I tried it. The shine I had been dealing with in the hot weather dissapeared. And it has vitamins C and E in it, in a ""featherweight"" formula. It makes my face feel wonderful. Hydrated and light at the same time. ",2
"At first I thought this would be too large, but surprise!! All of my Bare Minerals and lots of lipstick and shadows fit perfectly. The color is fabulous. It looks terrific on my bathroom shelf. Now I'm organized with makeup in one place. ",4
"at first, i was skeptical because I have a weird medium skin tone that looks even more weird with make up on.>< but i am hooked with nars orgasm. I only dab a little bit on my cheeks, nose, and forehead and fan it out with a brush. It gives me that subtle sheen,but absolutely gorgeous glow. It's looks very natural as well. i pair it with Multiple in Orgasm. :)",0
"At first this scent didn't seem to have much to offer, but after I allowed it to develop on my skin I grew to appreciate its delicacy. I didn't find it to be very long-lasting, but it did stay true for as long as it lasted. ",2
Athough I use many Philosophy products this one wasn't for me. It didn't seem to offer much coverage and irritated my skin. In all fairness to Philosophy Bare Mineral makeup does the same thing to me. ,2
"At least it's not for someone with light skin like mine. I ordered the lightest shade and it's still darker than my lips. It is a very nice lip liner otherwise, but not the color of MY flesh. So, 5 stars for quality, zero stars for actually being flesh-toned . ",4
At my age i dont really have a lot of lines and wrinkles however this treatment made my skin glow. I also have very sensitive skin and i was worried that i would breakout and i was wrong. great treatment A+++++ ,1
"At my age, I have tried just about every pencil or eye liner out there. This is the best one I have found. It doesn't flake, drift below your eyes, or smudge on your lid above. The handle is the perfect length and the applicator tip is perfectly shaped to get the liner just where you want it. It is easy to get a very fine line, or go thicker if you like. Best one I've found.",4
A tremendous value - gave me the opportunity to try this line. Clear directions (which I needed) and a sheer beautiful outcome. The concealer is very good and the powder is out of the world. Brushes are very high quality. I get compliments every time I wear it. ,4
"At work I need to look polished and professional, not like a pop princess. Just a little amount of gloss, but the color enhances my lips and I look beautiful. The hint of mint is great for after coffee break... This product is perfect for women who want a little shine, but are too mature for the super gloss that tends to show up on teenagers. ",1
"A very light-feeling and looking mascara (accurately described as feathery). I have long lashes already, but I MUST wear mascara or you can barely see them. I have not encountered clumping or smearing at all, and the brush does a great job of keeping the application layerable and light. This is certainly my favorite mascara, and I have tried MANY from Sephora and your neighborhood drug stores! :D ",1
"A very nice sheer lipstick... I have some of the darker colors (#8, #15, #20) which look great... I'm not as keen on the lighter colors on me because they seem to wear off faster... the lipsticks have a pleasant taste and I like that it has 15 SPF. ",3
"Awesome - fab products. I like Terax Latte, a great shampoo for a really thorough cleanse - especially after swimming and multiple products that strip moisture. I have to finish with Terax CREMA though - BEST HAIR PRODUCT EVER!!! Really good for all hair types - even my crazy, Italian curls! ",1
"Awesome, perfect, flawless, says it all. You have everything you need to have the perfect canvas for your face! My skin looks dewey & still everything that needs covered is. The concealers are great. My new favorite is the Tinted Moisturizer! Love it! ",3
"awesome product! i have three strands of hair and love it--my husband and his thick (but thinning) hair comes alive w/this, and my blessed daughter with her long and luxurious tresses, just soaks this stuff right up! no greasiness, just beautiful shine! ",2
"Awesome product that washes up really well! I wash mine every week and it cleans up great. Since it is adjustable, it fits everyone's head and since it is so wide it covers up the hairline really well. It keeps all the cleaners and masks off your hair. ",2
"Awesome product! Worth every penny. Dramatically cleared up acne, hydrated, and reduced redness in my skin after just 2 applications. I use it as a mask every morning now, and will definitely buy this product again!",1
"Awesome, wonderful, superb! I can't say enough about how great this eyeshadow is. It is so pigmented and vibrant. The color goes on smoothly and lasts all day. There are so many colors to choose from...I love it! ",2
"a wise saleswoman sold me this gel to use under my givenchy mister light concealer/highlighter. i put it on and immediately put on the mister light. i have always had a problem with dark undereye circles and dry skin and this one-two combo is a miracle. i also use hylexin, which tends to dry the undereye area. give murad a try! ",3
"B1 did an alright job of lifting stains. Super easy to apply and control where and how much you use. I love that it did not irritate mouth or around sensitive lips. No odor or taste. Will not drip, product stays in place. ",2
"Back in the day, when I would wear perfume daily, this was one of my two favorite scents -- it didn't overpower the nose but still had a beautiful scent. If I ever go back to wearing perfume, it will certainly become a mainstay again. ",1
"Badgal Blue is to die for. It makes the whites of my eyes whiter and my hazel eyes more green, not to mention the length it emparts to the lash. Not waterproof by any means and be sure to run the brush over a tissue before you apply. Then be ready for compliments. You will get them!",3
"BADgal is the only mascara I've ever found that completely coats my long (but super blond) lashes. The mascara stays on all day but washes off easily. I rarely have clumps or spider lashes with this, and I'll continue to use it daily.",1
"BADgal Lash is the Ultimate all-in-one mascara.The formula and brush tag team lashes to thicken. lengthen, and define even the thinnest barely there lashes! This is only mascara I can rely on because it doesn't flake off like other thickening formulas found at drug stores.",1
"Bare Escentuals is my absolute favorite makeup. I've tried other mineral products and they just don't compare. The ruby eye shadow colors are gorgeous. The Buxom lip polish looks great on. The eye shadows and face foundations last forever. Try it, you'll love it! ",3
"Bare Escentuals is the most natural looking of all mineral foundations and the only one that truly makes your face look radiant. BUT, the effects are short lived (4 hrs)due to in sinking in or oils surfacing, and it does nothing for covering age spots and actually makes them appear darker. I really don't care for the concealer and feel it's worthless. ",3
"Bare Escentuals makes the BEST brushes! I have been known to buy one of their kits mostly so I could have the brushes out of it. The one thing I had to learn from the BE consultant was that you use this brush with the BE mineral foundation (buffing as long as it takes you to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice) and then use the full application brush, another great one, for the mineral veil that comes in the starter kits.",3
"Bare Escentuals mineral foundation/powder is honestly such a wonderful product. For someone with super sensitive skin, BE works so well for my face--I have fallen asleep with this makeup on and woke up without breaking out! This is a great non-comedogenic product for a pretty good deal--foundations, a warm color blush, and brushes! ",0
"Bare Escentuals Precious Diamond Beauty Duo is amazing. It transforms my skin into a flawless, glowing, canvas. I love it and use it every day after applying my foundation. It is the best brozer I have ever used and looks so natural. ",2
"Bare Escentuals products are definately worth every penny. Great colors and quality in everything I have used. Just got my 3rd lip color, this one in Stella. Looks amazing, not sticky smells good and covers nicely, not heavy like a lipstick. ",2
"bareMinerals is truly an amazing foundation. I have never had an acne problem but I had the occasional blemish like many women. Since I have been using bareMinerals I don't even get the occasional ones anymore. Best of all, I get great coverage with looking ""made up.""",1
"bar soaps can be quite drying to the skin, even if they are packed with moisturizing ingredients. I like to use a bar soap facial cleanser as an alternate to my liquid cleanser, and I bought every moisturizing facial soap at department stores and health food stores that claimed to be 'super gentle' and moisturizing. they all nuked my skin, taking all of the moisture out of the top layer. and then I tried Korres Milk Soap. I had no expectations for this bar, but to my delight, it totally delivers on its claims of being moisturizing and soothing. it gives you a light, silky foam with a soft, fresh scent. AND IT DOES NOT DRY OUT MY SKIN! I can use it twice a day, and it cleanses leaving my face refreshed, but not tight-feeling. make sure to get yourself a slotted soap dish so it can dry between uses; it can get a bit mushy. it's a small bar, but I've found it really lasts. and you get two of them! I love this soap, and absolutely recommend for anyone who prefers their cleanser in a bar form. even my dry, sensitive skin has benefitted from using Milk Soap. and it's a great buy! love this stuff. ",2
"Based on my love of what Boscia has done for my face, I decided to try the body wash...FABULOUS. I am officially an all over Boscia girl. This Body wash leaves your skin clean and moisturized. Pleasant smelling but also very much so eligible for unisex use. Try it you will not be disappointed. ",3
"Based on other reviews I expected to be blown away by the Perfect Skin Perfection Gel. The product does not make a noticeable and impactful difference on my skin (which is relatively problem free other than a few fine lines). I get nearly the same results with philosophy's poreless flawless, at a significantly lower price. ",3
"Based on previous reviews I expected much more from this. It was so subtle that it wasn't worth putting on. I much prefer Laura Mercier's Shimmer Mosaic Bloc. I have it in pink and orchid, and absolutely love it. If you're looking for something to give you a subtle but noticeable sheen, and a little flattering color, try the Shimmer Block. ",3
"Based on so many of the reviews, I ordered this lipstick in Real Red. I'm hooked - creamy, smooth, hydrating, great color with excellent staying power. I will be replacing my other brands with Shisheido - and with the colors so true, I doubt I will have to have a huge assortment. The Real Red is a blue red with a strawberry undertone - LOVE it! You don't need a gloss with this lipstick - but a dab in the center of your lips gives the color an extra ""wow"". Worth every penny. ",4
"Based on the reviews, I am dying to try this makeup. It sounds perfect! But PLEASE take out the fragrance. If there is any one thing that irritates sensitive skin, it is perfume. Please, please, please. ",4
"Beautiful blushes in the always right colours! I love Deep Throat, Taos & (I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but...) Orgasm, of course. I have to admit that the Orgasm shade is absolutely stunning on everyone I've seen use it. It's really shocking actually, but it always seems to work. With all of these, a little goes a VERY long way, so apply with a light hand at first (especially with the darker or brighter shades).",1
"Beautiful highly pigmented, blendable powder blush. Allows for sheer natural looks to build up of dramatic color, depending on layers of application. This was the first powder blush that did not ""grab"" and did not look ""dry"" on my dry skin. The shades in the pans do not reflect the way they look on. The colors are so workable that most shades could be worn by anyone. I have used Fade, Heat, Soar and Tutu. They have a bit of luminosity which is flattering on. ",4
Beautiful scent. But I cannot give new fragrances more than 3 stars because of their universally WEAK staying power. What's with that deplorable new trend? The least the manufacturers could do is lower the prices to compensate for their scents disappearing in a couple of hours. I don't see that happening. ,4
"Because I have some skin imperfections to cover, I use a cream-to-powder foundation first. Then, after I have my eye makeup done, I brush on a liquid foundation. This brush is perfect. The foundation goes on with no marks whatsoever. I lvoe it ",4
"Because of the intro to this product I ordered it but I wasn't that impressed by it. It appeared to have harsh scent which, in my opinion, was too strong. But keep in mind I have sensitive skin. If you are looking for a simple wash but have good skin this can be for you. But if you have sensitive skin don't think this is the mild formula. It is not! ",2
"...because packing this liquid product in a tube means that it tends to erupt all over the place when I take the cap off. Things that are messy to use gravitate to the back of my cosmetics drawer. I'm experiencing menopausal acne breakouts and want something natural but effective. Cinnamon and Thyme are supposed to be really effective ... hope so, when I decide to raid the back of my drawer some day when I'm bored. ",4
been using bare minerals for 5 years i think........\n\nthere's a GOOD reason bisque is a *best of sephora*.......it's the BEST of any......and ALL!!!\n\nquite simply.....a miracle....\n\nas is EVERY single bare minerals product!! it is ALL true!!\n\npositively LOVE bare minerals!!!\n\nand i WILL......forever....,4
Been using it for about 3 weeks and the sun spots are significantly lighter. It's a little sticky for a while after putting it on; seems to work best when I use it at night (when there's less chance of accidentally washing or wiping it off).,3
Been using PerriconeMD for a few months. Love the results and this set was a great savings. I am always complimented on my skin and people do not believe me went I tell them my age and that I'm a grandmother of four. Thank you Dr. Perricone and Sephora ,4
"Been using this for about two weeks, as directed. I don't see any difference in my hair at all. I have naturally curly hair so maybe this product doesn't do anything for curly hair. Was a waste of money for me. ",3
Before I go anywhere the only make up item that I must have on is my lipstick. The NARS said that it was long lasting but it is not. It needs to be applied several times during the day. It is however true to the color in the picture.,2
"Being that this is my introductory product to Smashbox, I'm not all that impressed with this product. I purchased it in shade 3.0. Although I'm happy with the shade I selected, I'm not all that thrilled with the product itself. To me, the consistency of the product makes it difficult to apply;it didn't exactly glide on like a cream should. It usually doesn't feel like I am getting much product on my face when I apply it directly from the tube ar onto a concealer brush. The coverage wasn't as amazing as the description made it sound either. ",0
Benefiance Concentrated Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream is an excellent product. I have tried many eye cream over the years from low priced to expensive. This product tops them all. Very concentrated - very soothing - not greasy and an affortable price. You won't be disappointed,2
Benefit's lipstick is long-lasting and goes on soooo smooth. It leaves my lips feeling hydrated for hours. I highly recommend this product. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of this purchase! ,2
"BE's mineral makeup is great, but I hate dealing with loose powders, especially when not at home. I've filled my brush with BE Mineral Veil, and it works very well. I like everything about the brush - portability, application, closes without smushing the bristles, etc. - but it can be a bit big in a purse. Nonetheless, I still carry it with me everywhere I go. It's easy to fill and holds quite a bit of product, too. ",3
"best blush ever! this color is awesome! it looks so natural and blends easily! almost to easy. becareful putting on your bronzer or you may brush it off... still i love the color looks so natural, very light and long lasting",1
Best Cleanser I've ever used for my acne prone combination skin (mostly oily) skin. It didnt make me break out any more than usual infact it helped. The corner of my nose had less dead cells skin around it. Totally saw a difference. Takes off heavy makeup. You really should wash your face for a minimum of 30 seconds. You really get your money's worth. Leaves you skin feeling fresh and clean. It's like everything that should come off really does.,1
"Best conditioner ever. When I started using it, my hairdresser noticed the difference and raved about how healthy my hair was. Leave it in after a shower and sleep in it for extra conditioning, mix a little with water and apply to wet hair for super moisturized curls -- it's an amazing product. ",1
"Best overall color is O****. I have 3 daughters, and all with a different complexion color. This peachy color works best for all of our skin types and colors. Stays on all day--looks great for evenings out. Looks natural and 'fresh'.",3
"Beware of rip-off! Even after using it for over a month, I couldn't even get one extra day of not shaving out of it. It did make the legs temporarily smooth, however, but did not decrease hair growth. ",1
"Bi-Facil is the best eye makeup remover for my sensitive eyes. I have severe allergies to many other eye makeup removers on the market, and this is the first one that takes my waterproof mascara off with one cotton pad per eye (as compared to needing several swipes with other brands). It does have some oil in it, but is mostly used as an accelerant for the remover liquid to ensure no tugging or smudging. Best product I've ever used!!",3
"Black Orchid is a fragrance so rich, deep, and warm that you really only need spritz yourself once and it's there for good; even at the end of your night still lingering, though you yourself may not detect it, others do. It is a scent that exudes luxury. Worn by a woman whom should be taken seriously.\nNot to mention men go wild over it.",0
"Blinc - Kiss Me Mascara is a God send in the mascara world. I have finally found a mascara that stays on my lashes not under my eyes and comes off with just water. No odor, fibers, or stains. I will never switch, thank you Sephora.",4
"Bliss is heavensent! I live in a very dry, hot desert climate and I love Lemon & Sage Body Butter's clean and crisp scent! But more than that, I love it's long lasting skin smoothing. It stands up to our extreme climate and keeps my skin silky soft. ",4
Bold color with super stay on power. Some eye pigments need an eye shadow base to stay on. Not this one! I bought two colors so far and they are absolutely fabulous. This glides on easily with great brush and stays all day. ,2
"Bought in med brown -- only complaint is brush too stiff & instead of laying down a nice line, it scrapes the liquid liner along, making application uneven. A better quality brush, about 1/3 shorter (brush length, not overall length) would make this an excellent liner.",4
"bought the rocker eye after a long debate, love the colors, thought i was too old for something like this (47), but it was not what i expected, like all minerals it is very flattering, as it turns out all the 20-30 year olds at work liked it so much many of them purchased it also, the colors are rich, creamy,and goergeous, i am so glad i have this now, bare minerals rock!!!!! ",3
"Bought these tweezers based on a recommendation from a friend and these are absolutely the best tweezers I've ever used. Very precise, can easily pull the shortest of hairs yet still be gentle on my skin. Highly recommend. ",1
"Bought the sugar plum. Mixed, they make a perfect blush shade and you can use the lighter shades as highlighter and the darker for contouring. Haven't tried it as eyeshadow yet, but the texture of these is smooth and creamy so I'll bet they will be great there too. ",3
"Bought the travel first. Liked it so much, I had to have this one. I hesitated, because of the price, but decided time saved, was worth it....I sent in all warranties and hope it will last, we'll see.... ",3
Bought this after receiving the free sample. It is delicious and surprisingly light. People tell me that it makes them smile when I wear it. The body mousse in the same scent is heaven for the skin too!,1
Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loved it. Many types of make-up from eye shadow to lip glosses to blush and bronzers. The package is too cute and actually doubles as a music and faux jewlry box with twirling ballerina ! ,4
Bought this as a gift for a hard to buy for friend. She is in her late 20's and loves it. She'll be using it to transport jewerly when she travels on vacation in about a week.1st time I was able to find something I thought she'd really like and really use. ,2
"Bought this as part of a massive binge experimenting with body bronzers tthis summer, when a new tattoo meant I had to go bare-legged for several months! Even if you're extremely fair-skinned, don't let the darkness of the product in the package scare you off -- it goes on remarkably sheer, giving you only a hint of color. My legs are so pale they practically glow in the dark, and I was still able to use the ""bronze"" shade without it looking unnaturally dark! While it varies a bit from shade to shade, the shimmer in most of these is light and fine-grained enough for daytime wear -- it just gives you a little bit of glow without looking like you're wearing chunky, visible specks of glitter. The stick goes on surprisingly light and dry -- it feels very slightly waxy when first applied, but after it sets for a minute or two it really doesn't feel like you have anything heavy on your skin. And it's a lot more portable and convenient to use than powder bronzers or lotions -- the sticks are spill-proof and great for travel or touch-up on the go. As other reviewers have noted, these aren't just for legs, either -- try using them as highlighters for shoulders and decolletage, the shimmer and light scent are versatile and so nice for layering with other Michael Kors fragrance products! ",2
"Bought this on a whim at Sephora one morning when I had a jam-packed schedule and no time to go home and freshen up hair that was going a little limp...good thing I only got the trial size, this was a total disappointment. The only good thing about this product was the scent -- it left my hair feeling even limper and more weighed-down than before. Perhaps it works better on shorter or coarser hair, but my hair is thick, fine-textured and very long, and this stuff wasn't helpful at all. (The trial/travel size can is also surprisingly small -- folks with short hair might get more use out of it, but it was pretty much dead after one use on my waist-length hair.) ",2
bought this on a whim.love the colors. everything goes on so easy. eye pencil is very easy to apply. colors are perfect together. used the darkest shade as a liner also and stayed put all day. the case is fabulous. there is a strip to cover all colors and case has magnectic closer. great for travel. ,3
"Bought this on a whim the other day and was surprised at how much I like it! I have a love/hate relationship with lipstick - I love it, but it never lasts very long on my lips, and most long wearing formulas are drying. This is perfect! I got Go Fig; the color is like your lips but better - natural but more vibrant - it's my new Fall favorite! ",2
"Bought this @ Sephora because I need to again try another makeup. I have a ton of skin allergies. First, the coverage is terrific. Secondlly, it looks so natural. But most important, my skin has not had an eczema outbreak. I am hooked!! ",4
"Bought this to bring on vaca. and it worked very well! Lemony-scent (not as tremendous as the jamine, but quite nice). Roots never looked greasy and scalp never itched. Couldn't tell that I skipped a shampoo. * do be aware of the amount of product you are using as it can cause that powdery-look if too much applied. Little goes a long way and the clean, subtle scent will last until the following day. Hair really seems fresh even if it is not so much. A great buy. ",2
"Bought this today and used it once, and I can see and feel a difference! Cleared my pores and completely erased the shine on my face! After cleansing, I applied the original Hope in a Jar for all skin types, and was ready to go! Smells light, and smoothes my face to an incredible soft! ",0
"Bouquet Dive is a perfect natural shade for me. It applies smoothly, silky and feels moisturizing. However, it doesn't last AT ALL. If you have time to re-apply once an hour, then this is for you. It would be perfect if it only lasted. I love the color and texture. ",4
"Boy, is this nice! Each of the four base colors can also be ""shimmerized"" by sweeping across the butterfly portion of the color so there are really 8 colors here -- while they look shimmery alone, they go on smooth and subtle for day, and are extremely flattering on 40-something eyes -- even when ""fully charged."" This will be my choice throughout the holidays! ",2
"Boy this is great stuff. It keeps my lips moist, keeps the sun off, and is a just right wash of color without being too heavy. I really don't like heavy matte (makes me look old) or the glitter (I'm not 17) which so many lipsticks seem to have now- I wanted something with color but not too intense, and not full of sparkles. This fit the bill! The Talia color is great if you're doing a smoky eye, but do want a bit of color on the lip. Just the right amount of the most gorgeous semi-sheer light cherry/plummy shade ever made. Perks up your whole face! Go for the lighter colors if you want that pale lip look- keep in mind, they do allow a bit of your natural lip color to shine through. I have the Sarah color as well, and it seems to be a bit more of a pale sandy color than the bright pink it showed up as on my monitor- but great for summer. I love this stuff. Can't say enough good about it. For those of you who use Clinique's Black Honey Almost Lipstick- this is similar, but more creamy and little more opaque in color- plus, more of a color range now that Clinque stopped the Black Raspberry and the other special editions. ",3
"Brow Zings is a product that I have been using for years. It is a Benefit product and now is available at Sephora. It is the only brow product on the market that is worth talking about, and what makes it special is the wax component. It leaves your brows in shape and defining for the entire day and night.",4
Bubbly is AWESOME! It has such a delicious lather and a sweet scent that is to die for! Makes you feel so fresh and clean. You'll want to stay in the shower forever with this stuff! I've also given Bubbly as a gift; people love it! ,0
"But don't believe the alarming words on the box that states this is NOT REFILLABLE. A gentle twist of the bottom compartment opens up the reservoir which is, indeed, refillable. I have extremely oily skin, and Mineral Veil provides lustre without shine (and shine screams to me: ""OIL""). ",4
"But I finally tried Org*sm, along with the lip gloss. For my light complexion it's a great no-brainer: no matter what I'm wearing, how light or dark my make-up or clothing is, where I'm going, what for, who with....all I have to do is dust a little on the apples of my cheeks and it's never too much. I usually don't wear foundation, blush, or even powder. But Org*sm (which Sephora sees as profanity hence the asterisk) is perfect when I'm feeling like looking a little glowy or ethereal.",1
"But it does leave your skin a little shiny after you use it. Two pumps will do for your face and neck. It is very moisturizing and perhaps a bit too much so for oily skin or in summer, and the shine is not my favorite thing, but all in all, a good moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and rosacea and it doesn't irritate my skin.",1
"...but, it is Aucoin's name on the package -- so, I bit the bulllet! The Medium liner is nice, a bit on the yellow side even for Olive skin; however, I would NOT hesitate to try it out...Everyone is ""Different!"" ",2
"but no sign of any skin lightening. Used this daily for about 6 months. Didn't see any difference. Didn't make anything worse, was a nice enough product for daily use, no irritating smell, but it didn't do anything to change my complexion. ",2
"but not great. i do like it because it isn't greasy like many that i've tried. it has a little trouble removing my long-wearing clinique mascara, but mostly works pretty good, and it doesn't irritate my eyes. ",2
But wowie! My bf wears this and it is amazing. It is very clean and fresh. Nothing overpowering or musky about it at all and I think that is what I like most. So often colognes seems to be heavy and too woodsy for my taste but this one is just perfectly perfect.,2
"But you really have to use your finger to apply - so don't be fooled by the wand like it is putting on lip gloss. However, I really like this product and have it in a couple of colors. Creamy, long lasting, rich color ",2
"Buxom Lips is the Best lip product I've used. It isn't sticky at all and it gives your lips a nice refreshing feel. The full color is as nice as the glosses, and stays as nicely. Thanks for a great product that gives gloss but doesn't make you look like a teen. ",3
"Buxom\nmakes your lips feel so good. It makes them feel cool, fuller and\nprotected. I love the colors and also the clear. I use the colors over\ndifferent lipsticks and the clear Krystal at bedtime. It makes my lips\nfeel good all night.",4
"By far, this is the most potent of the lip plumpers I have tried; and I love it! The tingle is very strong;to the point that I feel a bit numb for a minute. The area around my lips did get red; so I started to apply it more carefully and before applying my makeup. BUT the end result was noticeably fuller lips; no gooey sticky mess and a gorgeous natural pink glow. Furthermore, my lips are incredibly soft long after the liquid absorbs. In the Winter time, that is a big bonus. Ultimately, that's what I look for in a plumper. I can deal with the rest. ",1
"By using these items together you don't have to worry about mixing the fragrance of your lotion with your cologne, etc....Smells great and the lotion feels so silky. I use it on my legs. A little goes a long way. ",3
"can be mesy(flaking onto eyelashes) when apply but has a beautiful effect. I was able to use the different colors, but it does take some time and effort. Using all colors together gives a beautiful effect. ",2
"Can't beat the price, but it isn't very long lasting. Takes a while to dry, also. A few of my nails got smudged because it took so long to dry. Fortunately I bought a color that is very similar to my normal nail color, so it isn't extremely obvious when it starts to peel. ",0
"can use as mask, face wash, i even dot on blemishes overnight. makes face so clean brighter turns over old skin quickly i tried s sample in the store and have been buying it ever since. i have 30 year old skin",1
"Cargo is the only line of blush/bronzers that I wear, and the Miami Beach color works perfectly with my blonde hair and fair skintone. It shimmers on my face and gives me a sun glow, so even during a northeast winter I can look like I've been to south beach! ",4
"CARGO's foundation brush feels soft against the skin, yet it's firm enough to spread foundation beautifully. The shape of the handle makes it easy to hold. This brush makes applying and blending foundation a breeze. Very good brush! ",2
"Caudalie has the best-smelling, airy, foaming cleanser on the market; not to mention, it's all natural-no parabens or anything artificial. I absolutely love it! The other products don't smell so nice, but this product by the company smells absolutely wonderful!",1
"CLEAN is one of the best smelling fragrances out there! It makes you smell and feel like you just stepped out of the shower. Makes you think of warm, snuggly, fresh-out-of-the-dryer laundry..... Aaaahhh, relaxing!",1
Clean your brushes at least once a week to prevent pimples! I use this once a week and it is amazing to see how much gunk it takes out of your brush. Just use it to clean then let it air dry (overnight) and your brush will feel almost as good as new. ,0
"Clears up acne breakout on shoulders and back very quickly. I saw an improvement after the first use. After a few more times, my skin had cleared up. I always keep this acne body wash on hand in case I need a fast result!",1
"Clinique repairwear works well for me. I am 60 and tinted moisturizers just won't do for me. This foundation is able to cover well, but is not oily or greasy. I can also use it to cover problem spots. For the price, this is a great product. ",4
"Color 362. At first the lipstick was dry but after 3 or 4 applications it was creamy. No smell! Since we ""eat"" lipstick I feel much better using an organic product. Also, I trust Australian and European products, higher safety standards. Testing not for sale to highest bidder. A lot of preservatives still allowed in the States are forbidden in Europe and Australia. ",3
Combine the fabulous Double Rich Hot Cocoa 3-in-1 (which certainly is great on its own) with one of the cookie-scented 3-in-1s and you've got an evening snack shower or the best breakfast shower ever! ,4
"Coming from a BE junkie, I did not like this product at all. The colors are all too similar when on AND worst of all they went to a funky hot-pinky color on me which is very unusual. I am going to try and return this palette. ",3
"Compared to some other lash stimulators and growth products out there,..this does just as good a job for a whole lot less! I was surprised at how great my lashes looked after 2 months, (you need to give it some time), a lot fuller and longer. Before this product I was spending 3+ times that on Jan Marini's! This does the same job,.the only complaint is that it tends to run out or dry up fast. All these type of products do. ",3
"Couildn't love this more! Have had what I thought were dry skin problems until I was told that it was really more a matter of getting in some exfoliating. Did it last night and my girlfriend was stunned, as I am this AM - my skin is glowing! this with almost no sleep and a migraine this AM. soft and gentle feeling, yet powerful. a light almost lemongrass scent which didn't even affect my headache - so subtle. ",2
"Could I smell any better? No! And for longer? No! Love this stuff & how it moisturizes without leaving an icky residue and how the scent doesn't wash away with the shower water but leaves a subtle, warm scent all over me. And it doesn't take much. Definitely has earned a permanent place in my shower! ",4
Creamy and highly pigmented. Goes on well with a brush or sponge. Love the super coverage and flawless finish. Doesn't settle into my lines and I don't need any cover up in any area with it. Highly recommend! ,3
"Cute little container. Smaller than I thought it would be. Certainly a novel way to put on gloss. Color wasn't exactly what I wanted. A little too bright for someone with older lips. It did go on smooth, it felt good and the smell was okay. The applicater was a little whimpy. ",4
"Cute little palette, not the most portable one I have ever bought, but if you keep your make up at home, then there's no problem. Pretty eyeshados shades, the lipglosses are sheer and suitable for pretty much any time. ",0
"Daisy is a nice fragrance...I must admit the body lotion stays on all day long whereas wearing the perfume alone does not. The bottle is adorable, love the flower key chain, too. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you try it!",4
"Daisy is a very sweet and youthful perfume. It has a very light and pretty scent. Don't expect compliments with this scent, no one will even notice you have it on - in a good way (if that's something you appreciate). A perfect scent for summer.",1
"Darkness under the eyes and on top of the eyelid are part of the natural aging process, along with puffiness for no good reason (no late-night partying - but what is that sac under my eye?). I have faithfully tried many products from excellent beauty houses, and this is the first one that has actually worked for me! I noticed lightening and reduced puffiness within one or two weeks, but the most dramatic results were seen after a month of use, which the beauty consultant at Sephora siad would be the case for my 'age group.' The top of my eyelids are no longer dark and crepey, the skin underneath my eyes is multiple shades lighter and less crepey . There has been so much improvement that I usually don't need to apply any color to the eye area to blend it with my natural skintone (migraine days are the exception...those, too, may come with age). And whatever puffiness is present in the morning is so slight, and disappears a few minutes after applying this product. I use an olive oil based shampoo and conditioner on my chemically treated hair (what, show the gray? Never!), and my hair is always healthy, shiny and lustrous. So, I should not have been surprised that this L'Occitane product actually works. Be patient, use it every day (just a wee dab will do it), and you will be ecstatic. If we're lucky, we'll grow to be as old as the hills, and the life we've experienced will appear as character on our faces. Relish that thought, enjoy very age you are in, take good care of yourself (no one else will), stop worrying about things over which you have no control, and when you're really, really old (whatever age that is)...you might be surprised to see that you have the most interesting, beautiful face of all your ages. EnjoyEveryAge ",3
"Decided to try the product based on the description - pleasantly surprise how smooth and easy the spray comes out - makes the face feel moist while setting the make-up for the day. If needed, a mist during the day refreshes the skin and adds a bit of moistness - I am happy with this product and glad I tried it. ",4
Definitely the best exfoliator I have every used. I love how the product adjusts so you don't overdo it. Got this as a sample with purchase and returned to get the full - sized product on my next visit. ,3
"Described here as a shimmering, golden bronze, Mystic Violine is far from that. It is a rich, dark brown-plum creme. Very vampy and beautiful on, but not as spectacular as Dior's previous Golden Nugget. As with all my other Diors, the wear is fantastic! ",2
"Despite all the good reviews that made me buy this product, I did not understand it at all. It looked like a white lipliner and did nothing for the look of my lipstick. It did not look good on my eyes, either. I returned it. ",4
"Despite the insane price, I wanted to try this & I'm glad I did. This mascara really enhances the volume and length of lashes without clumping or flaking. You end up with smooth, separated & full lashes that look natural, no thick spidery legs. The super thick brush coated all of my lashes with one coat (& I have HUGE eyes!), and two coats later I had a very full fringe of lashes. So you can choose how dramatic of a look you want. It also did not flake or smudge at all for me. Wore beautifully throughout the day. Everything you could ask for in a mascara! Too bad it is so pricey... ",0
"did not like the product very much. you have to keep resharpening it and no matter how gentle you sharpen it the point just keeps breaking. when you do get a good enough point, its only enough to line half of your eye, the pencil literally melts away.",0
"Did NOT like this pencil. I have been on a quest to find a great concealer pencil (as one I had been using for years is no longer available - different brand) and this is NOT it. SO disappointed! This one went back to Sephora. The color I chose (the darkest available) was a bizarre light yellowish shade. I have a medium skintone & ordered the darkest shade because they both looked so light in the online photo. Well, not only was it far too light, but it had this strange yellow cast....and the texture was sticky, thick & dry. Even if the color had been good, I can't imagine applying this anywhere near the under-eye area. ugh. No, no & no. ",2
"Didn't know it was a lotion form. It leaves your face feeling a little like it still has soap on it. I've used the mild soap before, I prefer that to the extra mild. Next time I will purchase the mild.",2
"didn't really like this value set. you may think that u are getting a bargain but then you end up with not so good products. the only things that i found were useful in this kit were the serum and the hydrgen peroxide cream, the other 2 were just basically useless. i would rather buy those products separately than wasting extra money on useless products. ",0
"Dior shadows are fabulous, highly pigmented and smooth blending as well as coming in classy elegant compacts. I didn't expect to love this palette as much as i do, it can be hard to find so if you find it at your Sephora buy it. The center peach color is my all time favorite I wish it came in a single. ",3
"Diorshow is my absolute favorite mascara. It makes my lashes look full and sexy. I don't even need to use an eyelash curler - this stuff works wonders! In addition, I had never used the Hydraction Eye Cream before but I love how it works! It brightens my eye area and just makes me look more awake and healthy. ",0
Does a beautiful job leaving my skin feeling fresh and clean. I also like the fact it can be used to remove eye make-up without irritating my eyes. (not waterproof eye make-up though) Took off one star. I just don't like the scent. I wish it didn't have any scent at all. I've gotten used to it but I don't like the way it smells.,4
"Does exactly what it is supposed to do, lining perfectly. The bristles are firm but not irritating, and get right into the lash line for perfect application. This brush is well made and does not lose bristles. ",4
"Does exactly what it says on the label. Nicely exfoliating and moisturizing. The scent is amazing, and is not so strong as to overpower any fragrance you may use. Leaves skin wonderfully soft and hydrated. ",4
"Does exactly what it should, isn't messy. Worth the money entirely! Pays for itself in no time. This product is great! It lasts a long time and definetly lasts longer than blotting paper. Never leave home without it! (The Adorable packaging doesn't hurt either)",0
"Does not smudge. Ever. I love it. It flakes a little bit, but I'll take that over smudging anyday. It also is not waterproof, so it does not damage my lashes. I have very oily skin and this is the only mascara that has given me amazing lashes without raccoon eyes. Definitely worth buying for those with oily skin. Just wish it gave a little more curl. ",0
"Doesn't bother my sensitive skin. Very moisturizing, and if it gets shiny thru the day, I fix with transulcent powder and it's not a problem. I do use concealer, since coverage is light. I use LF3 and it blends in fine. Someone with very oily skin might like Tarte better; it's dryer, and I'll use it in the summer.... ",3
"Do not understand all the hype about this product! Not at all thickening or lengthening-very much a copy of Blinc Kiss Me Mascara. Best thing about it is it wont run or smudge, but really only darkens lashes. Got the kit with the lash curler-it broke after I used it twice. ",2
"don't be scared off by the appearance of this powder. you won't turn 'lemon-y' in color. the yellow tone is there to fight redness and makes the skin look flawless. the powder is INCREDIBLY fine in texture, so it goes on in the sheerest veil, providing hours of oil control. you can also re-apply- the dispensing mechanism makes this a breeze- throughout the day without caking. if needed, gently wash the pad on the top of the applicator, which I have done since my powder has lasted a long time, even with repeated daily uses to control shine on my nose, cheeks, and forehead. a great product. ",2
Don't care for the name.......poison part.........but LOVE the fragrance. Takes only a small amount to be noticed. Have had numerous comments about how great it is!! I have been looking for a signature fragrance and have at last found it. ,4
"don't get me wrong i TOTALLY love clinique's acne solutions line, except for this product. i don't think its necessary at all, and it dries my skin out too much. get the foaming cleanser, the lotion, the spot treatment, and a good masque like the emergency cleansing mask or turnaround facial, but skip this step.",0
"Each of these products is fantastic in their own right, but to get them in a set is unbelievable! If you use all three your skin will be smooth, soft, and tighter. Highly recommended before a big night out! The body souffle uses the dampness of your skin to warm you. It feels like a heating pad (especially on the chest). Considering the body souffle costs $65 alone, this set is a great value. Mine came with the body mask only half full, which was disappointing, but the good price point really makes up for that. ",2
"Each product is nice and works reasonably well. However, the shampoo was on 3/4 full. I thought about returning it but didn't have time. Considering high cost of product, it should be filled just as conditioner was filled. ",3
"Earlier this year I burned myself with a curling iron. It was awful because it was on the side of my face, just left of my eye. I was hiding it with my hair for about 2 months before I realized it wasn't going away, in fact it was getting darker. I'm a darker toned black woman, and the darker you are, the less effective any product is. I tried several things and nothing worked. I bought this as a last ditch effort before I settled with the fact that I'd be deformed forever and the idea of wearing my hair up on my wedding day just wouldn't happen. I put this on about 4-5 times a week at night and now, about 1-1/2 months later, you can barely see it! My boyfriend was in shock when I pulled my hair up the other night and he said ""where is it""! I'm sure within 1 more month, it will completely disappear. If you have a burn, or a scar, this product is worth every penny. If it worked on my skin completion, where it's unlikely that anything will work, it will work on any completion!",0
"Easy to apply, sheer soft peachy blush and beachy bronzer. No streaking or color grabbing due to light, sheer texture. Buildable for as little or as much color as you like. The bronzer is the most believable I've ever used for a warm, naturally sun kissed look. High quality. ",4
"Easy to use, you can keep one in your purse, or near the TV - just apply whenever you think of it! There's no mess and it only takes a minute to apply - I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement in my normally very dry cuticles! ",4
"Effective, gentle, thorough cleansing that doesn't leave your skin feeling tight, dry, or irritated -- this has a light, milky texture that foams up into fluffy suds and rinses away smoothly, leaving your skin feeling clean and soft. My combination skin loves this -- it effectively cleans the oily patches without being too harsh for the dry areas. Like all of the Pureness line, this has a very mild, pleasant fragrance -- it's a delight to use. ",2
Especially like the Red Velvet -- smells just like chocolate cake! I like that the scents only last while showering or bathing -- doesn't interfere with your perfume. Would like to see Philosophy start a 3-in-1 gel of the month club - I'd be their first subscriber! ,3
"Euphoria doesn't do much for me. It's not unpleasant, and it's a nice, generic sort of blend of what could be a really interesting combination of scents.\n\nI know a lot of people love Calvin Klein perfumes, and maybe it's just because so many people wear them, but to me, Euphoria has nothing special to make it stand out from the crowd ... it leaves you smelling just like everyone else. The 3-star rating is titled ""average"", and that seems like a good fit for this scent.",1
"Even after hours of wearing this, my eyes look fabulous - like I just put on my mascara. Normally, mascara tends to ""leave"" my lashes, but this stays on and on and on. It makes my lashes look like beautiful fakes without any clumping - just long and lush. I don't think I'll ever use another mascara again!",4
Even if it comes with a hefty price tag ... this heavenly scrub smells so amazing that you want to eat it and it leaves your skin feeling totally soft and smooth! You don't even need a lot ... so if you are careful and use sparingly you can get a lot of use out of it ... it's a splurge worth every penny!,1
"Even though I am very fair, I have yet to find a NARS cheek color that doesn't look wonderful and natural. Very easy to apply. My favorite is Sin, but I'm so excited about the SuperOrgasm - such a pretty color and I love my blush with a little glimmer!",1
"Even though I have a light skintone, this primer was a little too yellow for me and looked very unnatural when worn alone. Its very hard to blend and it creases. I never bothered to return it so I use it once in a while. It doesn't really hold eyeshadow longer than a few hours. Its ok, but I wouldn't buy this product again. ",0
"Even though I was kind of 'turned off' by the name Super Orgasm, I was glad I overlooked that absurd label: this is a fabulous blush in that it is a natural combination of peach and rose and luminus flecks that give such a pretty, honest glow. Never mind all the ""afterglow"" nonsense...this product is flattering and lovely with just the right amount of sparkle. I love it and I am extremely hard to please. ! ",3
Even though the Brandi says its a deep shimmering rose it didn't seem very dark because all of these Buxom Lip colors are so sheer. It felt tingly but not in a bad way and I did seem to have a fuller top lip (my bottom lip suits me the way it is). I would highly recommend these to anyone who's looking for a lip plumper.,4
"Even though this foundation is really wonderful in many ways, as I stated in my previous review, I have found that I think that this foundation is causing me some bumps, red spots and a couple zits. I don't know whether I'm allergic to it, or if it is just clogging my pores, or both. But I think this is what is causing this reaction. ",3
"Even though this is listed as a masculine scent, when I first bought it, it was for either women or men. I love it and wear it all the time. I get comments on it a lot about how fresh and clean it smells. I think its great for men or women who like an Oriental/Spice based scent.",4
"Ever since I began using eye-shadow, I have never been able to avoid the creasing and ultimate disappearance of any product I have placed on my eyelids. This is due to my oily complexion. Only Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion has worked to keep all makeup on my lids in place without a messy look. ",4
"Ever since I first tried this, it's been my favorite by far; it goes on smoothly, looks beautiful andfeels great. The color lasts long after you've done normal ""work"" with your lips, so for me this is a perfect product. I find that Devilish is almost an exact match for what my lips used to redden like as a child. ",2
"ever since i smelled the sample from my last puchase here, all i can think about is ordering it. it's not overpowering or over sweet, though if just sprayed on a tester card may seem that way, but the dry down is much earthier. i love it. and i cant wait to buy it.",0
"Ever since the first time I applied this wonderful gloss to my lips, I have been hooked. I am sooooooo excited that wonderful people at BE developed not only additional colors but most recently, the full color products. I have never been dissatisfied with ANY BE and I have products that run the gamet. My lips/face feel refreshed when I apply the products and I get an incredible amount of compliments. Who wouldn't be happy about that?!!",2
Every blush I have ever used goes on to dark and looks like I have makeup on. This blush goes on perfectly with just the right amount of color. I have never been so pleased with a blush before and they all look completely natural.,4
"Everyone always raves about Amazing Grace but I never smelled it so I thought I'd buy this little perfume oil. Wow, was I disappointed. The oil just sits on your skin, it doesn't penetrate. I was afraid it would get on my clothes and ruin them. The smell was not that great, I don't see why everyone raves about this. I will never buy a perfume oil again because of how oily it is on the skin. ",2
"Everyone asks me if I'm wearing MAC - and I tell them that it's Sephora. They're always impressed. Ever since using these eye shadows, I have refused to waste any money buying eye shadows from any other brand. Sephora eye shadows - specifically this one - are the best. ",0
"Everyone either loved or hated this polish. I'm out on my decision. It's an interetsing shade of gray with purple undertones. Some called it chic, some thought it looked corpse-like. I'm still not sure... ",2
"Everyone should own *at* least one ""Midnight Cowbow"" as it look great on EVERYONE!!! With my hazel/brown eyes Midnight Cowboy over my entire lid with some ""Mildew"" creaping through that crease area... looks HOT! Use the Urban Decay primer with these and no worries about lines and creasing. ",1
Everything Bare Minerals product I have used has been excellent. I love the coverage and feel of the products. I have purchased them for my daughters to use as well. We are hooked and highly recommend these products to anyone and everyone.,3
"Everything everyone has said negative is true, uncomfortable, alters lipstick color, creases, dries, it's like applying liquid foundation to your lips, and then expecting to be able to apply lip color over it. Do NOT attempt to put just gloss over it. ",3
"Everything in this collection is excellent. The bright shades work together well and I especially love the eyeliner/eyeliner brush. Very easy to apply! Buxom Lip Gloss is an especially nice treat! This is well worth the money and in fact, I got another set as a Christmas gift. I'm in my 50's and the make-up is fine for my skin needs. ",3
Everything is great about this lip gloss... nice assortment of colors with high shimmer effect... good consistency so that it's easy to brush on and pleasant smell/flavor... the darker colors can be worn alone and I usually wear the lighter colors over lipstick... the packaging is appealing too. ,3
"Everytime I wear this eyeshadow (and it only takes a small amount), I get so many compliments. It has a wonderful sparkle to it that is both subtle and fabulous. I have given this as gifts to some of my friends so they can ""shine"" like I do when I wear it. ",3
"Everytime I wear this fragrance I feel huggable, kissable.... and edible! It's a delectable fragrance that reminds me of the penny candy stores at the beach peddling cotton candy, candy apples and other confectionary treats.",2
"Excellant!! As an Army wife, constanly going from meetings, to events, and briefings, this is a God-send and a blessing. It fits into any size purse attache' or evening bag. Never again to decide on chancing the day with out a touch-up, or to up grade the size of your bag to carry the pot and brush in a make-up bag. As convienant as your lip stick! ",3
"Excellent hydration and silky feeling, but this is too heavy for oily skin. The gel formulation is much better for oily skin or combination skin that leans toward oily. For everyone else this is very nice. ",4
"Excellent primer! I had been exclusively a Smashbox photofinish fan for quite some time. But now, I've switched. Prime Time is just as good, has a better delivery system (pump), and costs less. What more could I ask for???",4
Excellent product. Gets my skin completely clean. Works great with skin care regime. Recently went on vacation and left Clarisonic at home; after 3 days my skin looked horrible and when I got home broke out. Just happy to be back with my Clarisonic!! ,2
"Excellent quality soft hair in the full-size brush head, easy to refill. This is perhaps better for touchups than full make-up application as the powder does dispense a bit slowly from the single center hole in the brush, but it does still dispense more evenly than a lot of other powder-dispensing brushes I've tried! Great for mineral makeup or highlighters, as the relatively light and slow product dispensing makes it almost impossible for you to overdo it, even when working without a mirror. ",2
"Extremely effective, but way, way low on the quantity to price ratio. The bottle size is deceiving -- I ran out of this product within two weeks of purchase; about the same amount of time it took to completely clear up my skin. Bottom line: I'd only spend the money if there were an occasion that warranted clear skin in a hurry.",0
"Extremely good pencil with staying power and easy to apply. I use the silver to ""open"" the eye by lining the inside of the lower lid. Works perfectly. I use the black as a liner on the upper lid and smudge it. ",4
"Eyelid Primer should be in everyone's makeup case! I love the way it makes my eyelids feel smooth, evens out the color of my eyelids before applying shadow, and makes my eyeshadow colors look more intense. ",3
"Eye Shadow Trio gives you a complete, beautiful EYE LOOK in a SINGLE PAN. These are highly pigmented, blendable, long wearing and easy to work with eye shadows. Apply the lightest all over the lid as a base, medium to crease, add a bit of the deepest to the crease, as well as moistening it to line the eye. These have a nice sheen that you can build up or buff out. Great product and value! ",4
Fabulous! Dior Show coats every lash evenly thanks to the amazing brush. Clump free if you use 1 or 5 coats. Stays on for hours. Use it with the Sephora Professionnel Platinum Lash & Eyebrow Comb #21 for AMAZING lashes! ,2
Fabulous set! This sold me on the Laura Mercier Flawless Face! I purchased for Fair skin. Th shades are perfect. Directions most helpful. Texture of all products is very fine. Concealers are blendable and do NOT crease. Powder is the sheerest I've ever used. I highly recommend all! ,4
"face wash I have ever used. You can use it all over your face, eyes, cheeks and lips and it gets all the makeup off. Trust me, I used to use three different cleansers just to get my face clean and this works all by itself.",1
"Fair Flawless Fix Pencil ERASES LINES around the lips, under eyes (or wherever). it's easy to draw on, blends easily does not settle in lines or show on my fair skin. Great to use outside lip line for plumper lips and close to undereye (and even inside waterline, dark liner outside) to make eyes pop. This trype of pencil is commonly used in fashion photography to make model's eyes whiter, brighter. ",4
Fantastic item! This is the 2nd year I have purchased this product. Purchased 2: A treat for me and one as a gift. The samples are a great way to try new fragrances or pop in your purse for a quick pick-me-up. Great selection! ,4
Feels great going on after a shower. Spreads great and makes skin soft and shiny. My only problem with this product is that it doesnt last very long. As soon as it drys and I'm no longer oily; my skin goes back to being dry and ashy again. ,0
Fell in love and knew this was a fav forever the first time I sprayed it on in the Sephora. I took home a sample and used every last drop. I catch myself wanting to smell myself every chance I get. This is def a nose catcher of anyone near by :),1
Finally a cleanser that doesn't break me out or dry me out. I have had issues with break outs in my late 30's & this has helped a lot. Thanks Philosophy. I will definitely be trying other products from them!,2
"Finally, a hydrating mineral veil has been developed, and I love it. It feels great on the skin, and does not dry the skin at all. It is light as a feather and sooooo hydrating. I also love the antibacterial treated brush. Thank you Leslie!!!! ",4
Finally a mascara with a wand that I can use. I didn't poke myself in the eye and nothing clumped. Better still it stayed on until I decided to take it off. No smudges. I always want to use mascara and buy quite a few but then they disappoint or seem work or leave me feeling a dolt. This is the first one that gets a full five-star rating from me. ,4
"Finally! A pencil that glides effortlessly, smoothly and delivers awesome color that lasts. Most of the colors are for younger women/girls as the color intensity is too strong for a more mature look - but I use two of these regularly. Turned my young niece onto them.",4
Finally found a mascara that really works for me after years of searching my lancome was discountinued quite awhile ago and after literally trying everyone of there other brands and everyother brand i tried diorshow and have to say i didn't know my lashes can look this good which are naturally thin and short with this mascara there long and full no clumping the eye cream is good to eye have sensitive eyes and it never bothered me ,1
"Finally! I've fallen in love! This scent is so beautiful, yet subtle. I have received more compliments on Crystalline than any other scent I have ever worn! This will be my signature for a very long time!",3
"Finally! My huge pores and combination skin give me so much trouble, but using less than a pea size drop on my T-zone to cover the problem areas does the trick. You can't change what your DNA gave you, but this truly helps minimize big pores while mattifying under your makeup.",1
"First of all, Bliss body butter is fantastic! It's thick and decadent but not overly greasy and really moisturizes my skin. I was a little disappointed with the shimmer. It's very subtle, and I had to keep moving my arm around under a light to notice it, but it is there. The scent is fabulous, and I know I'll be buying more!! I really hope they bring this back next year, too! ",2
First of all you can hardly see this on your skin and I am very fair. Second of all you need to let it dry for a good 30 minutes before getting dressed or you'll have it all over your clothes. And even after that amount of time it still gets on your clothes. A lot of money for aggrevation. ,4
"First off I have good skin and I like a light coverage if I use any. The product looked like a great idea. But the light#2 was way to dark and it didn't produce a powdery finish I had hoped for. I think I am used to mineral make-up with ""forgiving"" color range. I sent it back. ",4
"First off i love anything and everything Nars. I have the blush in the big O and it's amazing, it's not too heavy but just enough shimmer to really make your face come alive. I definitely recommend it!",0
"First off it smells great. it isn't often that something smells as good for you are it is. This doesn't weight down my hair at all and I don't feel like I need to use lots and lots of it. A little in my hand I hydrate my hair and style, wonderful product and a constant in my collection. ",1
"First smelled this on a cruise, tried it on and fell in love! Been my all time favorite ever since. Not too heavy, not too light, always just right, very sexy. but not blatant. Has just a hint of musk, and it seems to my nose, a fruity note too. (to me smells like pineapple very fresh) Try it you will like it!",3
"First time I have used brow powder and very pleased. I am pleased with how long the brow powder stays on, it applies well to the brow. Feels like I don't have it on...doesn't dust the cheeks when applying. Thought I would end up with all sorts of powder in the top of the container after rolling around in my makeup bag and the packaging really doesn't allow for this to happen. I am very satisfied with this product ",1
"First time I used this, I kept getting a whiff of this fragrance all day long and finally I realized it was my hair! I love it...and you don't need to use much to get enough suds to wash your entire body. ",3
"First time I've tried this, it's awesome. I have somewhat oily skin and love to wear a lot of eyeshadow, this stuff made my eyeshadow look fresh working 12 hr. night shifts and also makes it through 2 hrs of sweating in the gym, no creases at all. Only bad thing I can say is the volume of prouct isn't really enough for the price but I am definitely sold regardless. ",2
"First tried the balm about a year ago...got my husband and some friends hooked on it and just bought the trios for holiday gifts! The product is a great moisturizer, makes my lips feel soft and smooth. SPF protection is a bonus! ",2
"First used it as a sample from an order. Liked it, ordered more. Used it up, then tried something else. Wow, I immediately ordered more Purity. It cleans, takes off all makeup, including mascara, and leaves your face ready for moisturizer. Love it. ",4
"Fizzy Lemonade and Pineapple Cocktail are so fresh and pretty. Great consistency and wonderful sheer colors. Also, the application is very discreet and easy to use in public ... no mirror necessary! We've all seen someone at a dining table putting on lip color with a mirror ... GASP!! ",1
"For all those future bag ladies who I know here in NYC that say glitter is for 12 year olds, wake up! This glitter adds a sexy shimmer to eyes and lips! I use very little just for a touch of magic! If I am out at the beach, I use it all over my eyes and lips...and sometimes on my body! It's no wonder I've got the men falling all over themselves and the other boring women jealous as can be! Life is too short! Jazz it up with glitter! ",0
"For anybody who has sensitive skin that occassionally breaks out, this would be a great cleasner for you. For one, it's a non-soap cleasner and it still suds up nice. It also doesn't over dry your skin at all. I've tried lots of different types of cleasners and keep coming back to this one.",1
"For dryness, this is the foundation. I do have to mix in a little moisturizer to thin it out. Good coverage, helps fill in the pores. Am having some trouble choosing the right color - seems too light for me. ",3
"For flawless skin, this is an imperative product. I use a kibuki brush to apply and use hardly any at a time because it's so fine, a little goes a long way. Perfects my skin, hides lines, and gives it a matte finish. ",2
"Forget pheromones. When I wear this, for some reason, men especially seem to like it. I guess it's appropriate considering that Tom Ford is the purveyor of sexy. This is by no means a perfume to casually put on every day, as it is strong. Once it settles down, though, it is incredible.",0
"For me, this blush, or cheek staih didn't deliver. My skin is very dry, so I have to use a lot of moisturizer. The stain didn't look natural, maybe because I didn't use the correct color, but the first time I used it, it was from a sample I ordered with my regular order ",4
"For me this product is great when you want a hot dramatic eye. If you shy from fun/bold makeup this might not be for you, but you definitly have the inner kitten out when you use this product. It's very smooth and it glides very nicely on. ",0
For me this was an ok product. I actually prefer to wash my brushes every two days or so with gentle soap and water. This basically works but seems drying for the brush and the smell is a bit overpowering. ,2
For my oily maturing skin this amkeup made my skin look soft and covered well at the same time. I have used many foundations - $$$$$ to -$. So far this overall is the best. Great color and I ordered online. ,3
"For once, here is a volumizing product that does exactly what it promises. My hair is fine but there is a lot of it, and with no natural wave, it tends to be limp and flat. Fat Hair Lotion plumps up each hair and creates overall volume that lasts all day. This is the only product I have found that works on my hair - I'm addicted to Fat and it's a wonderful thing. ",3
"For the mostpart, I like this gloss. It glides on smooth, lasts longer than many and I like the sponge tip. The only thing I didn't care for was the taste. For some reason, the taste of this gloss bothered me. ",4
For the price it's a good idea and a good way to test different colors. Has a pretty big selection of colors and has different textures for lips and eyes. It makes coming up with different looks easier since you can easily see what colors go together. Lots of fun. Wish they used actual Sephora colors. ,2
"For the price.. I was really disappointed. Sephora is much better for $10. I tried it out twice.. and by the third time, the brush was gunky. I keep my finger over the bottle when its open! STILL, it dried out. It was perfect for 2 wearings.. then it got thick and much harder to apply. WONT BUY AGAIN. Probably great for a one- timer, like 'your wedding.' Not for the rest of life. ",4
"For those of you who would like to take your makeup look to a new level, this collection of enhancers will do it. The instruction booklet and video are great tools and I always consider the value of the brushes that come with each BE collection. The right brush makes all the difference in the results I achieve with the products. It takes a little practice but it's worth it in the end. ",4
"For Use before blow drying, this is just right for adding volume and texture, especially for fine and thin hair. It stays in until your next shampoo too. The only problem is you have to use quite a bit, the bottle is small, and it's not cheap ",4
"For volumizing, you can't do better than this mascara. Better than BadGal Lash - not as clumpy. The only drawback is that it can be messy removing it. It says it's supposed to come off in tubes, but it comes off in small flakes. Other than that, great for super volume. ",2
"Fracas has been a favorite for decades. it is the quintessential summer fragrance, at once bracing and comforting. if you are a gardenia lover, you MUST try Fracas. it has one of the loveliest, truest gardenia notes I've ever encountered in a fragrance. reminds me of warm nights and gentle breezes. and the bottle is gorgeous- a timeless design from a time gone by. ",2
"Fragrance was true to description. Product was very light in emollient properties. Packaging was cheap. The pump cap fell off with first use and kept falling off until the container was empty. Also, there are parabens in this product. Not what I'd expect from a company touting the products & philosophy as natural. Very disappointing. ",2
"Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray is the only hairspray I will ever use. It holds my very curly hair to perfection, whether I wear it straight or want curl. Humidity doesn't have a chance. I absolutely love it. ",4
"Fresh Body Polish works wonders on my skin. I take hot showers that dry my skin. I can use the Brown Sugar and skip lotion. It's great after shaving and won't sting. It heals cuts, scraps and mosquito bites quickly.",2
"Fresh brand skin care is tops in my book, and I have tried EVERYTHING at one time or another. The reason I love it is because every product, including this one, is formulated not to impress but to improve. I would never be without 2 tubes of Sugar Blossom, one for my handbag, and one for my nightstand. To use and get the maximum benefits, use only a drop the size of a pearl. Rub your palms together to warm, then gently massage into the backs of your hands and wrists. It is quickly absorbed, non- "" pilling"" ( pilling up is a sure sign of a cheap hand cream), and is not greasy when used in the tiny amount needed. The fresh citrus scent is appropriate for my husband to use as well, and it relieves dryness to cuticles and nails as well as larger areas of the hands. Like all Fresh products I have tried and love, on first glance, the price appears higher than can be justified. But, a tube will last a very long time if the smallest amount needed to moisturize and protect against the environment is used. We live in a very dry climite year round, with extremes of heat in the summer, and I have never had a problem with greasiness or stickiness with this wonderful hand treatment cream. At my age ( close to 50), having unlined, firm hands is important to me. Fresh's Sugar Blossom Hand Cream helps my hands stay very youthful looking and feeling soft as silk. I highly recommend it for mature skin, especially. ",3
"Fresh Supernova makes thin, light lashes look thick and dark with just one coat. Cleans off exceptionally easily with water and cleanser--no need for harsh or oily eye make-up removers. Great for sensitive eyes, with no perfume or other irritants. ",3
"From my eleven-year-old, through an 18-year-old, and a 27-year-old, and on to me - - we all use this amazing stuff! I just buy the big containers to keep in the shower and the small ones go by the sinks. It's perfect. It's Purity.",3
"From the very first moment I smelled this perfume I was hooked! It was one of those perfumes that you just can't stop smelling right after you've purchased it. It's such a unique, and enticing scent. I am not a fan of really over-powering, strong or spicy frangrances, which is why this perfume was so appealing to me. Gentle and soft, but not so soft that you'll have to keep re-applying it. I've put this on in the morning, and had someone 15 hours later say how wonderful I smelled!! Gorgeous <3",0
"Fun, chocolaty scent! Smells edible. Smells just like chocolate! Great if you're not afraid to smell like that, otherwise skip it. Has a faint alcohol scent to it, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise great! ",0
"Fun, glitter for eyes. Mudd Clubb is one that you can wear even during the day. I am thinking about getting Roxy next. Only issue is that a standard pencil sharpener doesn't work - it is a ""fatter"" pencil which makes it easy to apply but you pretty much have to purchase the bigger sharpener. ",2
"Fun to try out fun color and new pencils for summer- these pencils stay on and were fun to mix up too for the summer ""shine""! Good value- would probably buy 3/5 full size so nice to check them out first. Good travel size too! ",3
"Fusion Beauty's Full Out Pout Set is an awesome value for an awesome product! Color Shine is a fantastic lip color and plumper in one. And the lip plumping pencil (in Pout, which is my favorite color) is the softest lip pencil I've ever used...it's incredible! I am going to go back and purchase a second set as a backup because this is such a remarkable value. ",2
"Gentle, but exfoliates very effectively - my skin needs major exfoliation to stay looking good. It leaves my skin glowing and smooth!! Amazing product, I have been using it for over a year now. Worth buying! I am 23 years old. It keeps my skin clear as well.",0
"Gentle Daily Cleanser is just that- a cleanser that you can use daily to cleanse, and soften, gently. If you are a fan of foaming cleansers, this is a great choice. It is a milky, creamy liquid soap that lathers into a light, foamy face wash that leaves your skin feeling clean and soft. ",2
"Gentle... Effective... and Simple. Received the Purity Made Simple cleanser as part of the ""Makeup Optional"" kit. Actually intended to buy only the moisturizer, but the kit was an amazing deal. DIdn't think I would love it as much as I do. But now I am hooked. Don't waste your hard-earned $$ any longer! This is the one. If you have the opportunity to purchase the kit, do so! Well worth it!!",2
"Get it, use it, love it! Your skin will plump, tighten, tone...it's like reversing the irreversable---your skin will become virgin-like again! Minus the blemishes, the fine lines, the sun spots, etc. If you've used any glycolic acidic product formulations previous to this, you'll be fine...I began with this product, skipping over WR1. This is wonderful stuff, & the tube is huge! A little goes a long way; fantastic value for $25! ",3
"Glossing cream makes my hair so smooth, shiny, and SOFT. I love that it can go on damp hair, because I don't always have time to dry mine, and it helps it dry naturally without getting frizzy. Just make sure you don't put any too close to your scalp or it can make you look a little greasy. ",0
goes on easily and is not too dry. not much sparkle to it so it is perfect for day/work wear. lasts a long time and has a perfectly realistic sun-tinted color like you have just been on a vacation. i would definitely buy again! ,2
"Goes on smoothly and stays on all day. I bought this liner as an alternative to the Makeup Forever waterproof pencil. It wears well, but smudge slightly below my eyes. Other than that, works great. I haven't tried to sharpen it yet, so I don't know if it fits a standard sharpener. ",3
"Going to that special event and you want a smile to dazzle everyone...use Flashlites...no strips or trays at the get ready panic time...put them in your purse for that ""afterwork"" party...your white smile will set you apart...another ""don't leave home without it"" ",4
"good brush, soft and easy to handle. However, the shape of the brush was a hard to use; I felt like it was easier to use this brush on someone else rather than myself because the brush was a little long while the handle is short.",0
"Good primer, but not as good as Smashbox Photo Finish...I was hoping that this would provide more moisture. That being said, it does have a nice, light, smooth quality, and would probably work better for someone with more oily or younger skin. Like the hint of coverage (I rarely ever use foundation, so this is plenty for me) and the SPF. ",2
"good product. Get the color one shade lighter than what you normally use. can use this product over the smash box primer or alone. I use it alone on hot, humid days which are 8 months out of the year in south Texas. ",3
"Good stuff! Dry, processed hair felt and lookd immediately improved--like hair again!. However, my hairstylist warned me that one should only use protein masks 2x a month or one's hair can get brittle. That should be on the label, rather than use 1-2 times per week. ",3
"Good stuff. I have really sparse eyebrows - there's almost nothing there to pluck, & maybe 3 tiny hairs at the outer edges - so pencilling looks creepily unnatural. Anastasia also makes a nice eyebrow gel, but if you don't have brow hairs, gels have nothing to hang on to. This product goes on easily with an eyeshadow brush, fills in the (large-ish) gaps in my thinning brows & the colors come in ""duos"" for blending so it looks completely natural. Makes me feel like Brooke Shields!",4
"Good value for the money -- these are very concentrated, thick and shimmery, and richly scented; a little goes a long way to produce rich, fluffy bubbles that don't leave my skin dry or irritated like many bubble baths. I'm only giving this four out of five stars, though, because the packaging could stand some improvement -- the flip-top lids can be a little tricky to open, and the plastic bottle is not shatterproof -- I dropped my small birthday sample in the tub and it cracked right across the bottom. The scent selection could stand to be a little broader, too -- right now there's an overrepresentation of intensely sweet foody and fruity-floral fragrances, nice for all the sugar lovers but not so great for folks who like scents that aren't as sweet! I preferred some of their older, dryer scents like Asian Ginger or Citrus Sage that have recently been discontinued. Still, if you can find a scent that you like in the current lineup, these are a good buy. ",2
"Gorgeous lipstick (and case! I just bought Positive Red... a beautiful warm red with a touch of gold. The formula is light, creamy, moist, long wearing and does not bleed. I slightly prefer the full coverage of Rouge Dior Replenishing Lipcolor however this one has a bit more of a sheen. I'm sold on Dio lipsticks! ",4
"Gorgeous shades, creamy and blendable, but it creased and smeared early on, even after setting with loose powder. I did not find it up to par with NARS powder shadows which stay beautifully If you love the shades, I suggest some powder shadow over to prevent creasing. ",4
"Gosh, is there anything out there that can give a shine to dark brown hair from the inside out without it looking even darker? I don't like the greasy looking sprays. This is the best of what I am searching for though I wouldn't purchase it again until I have tried others. ",3
"gosh, you spoil us, Sephora! look at all of these yummy colors! great formula, a tube lasts FOREVER, and a great price point! I like to layer the colors; darker around the outside of the mouth, a lighter shimmer in the center bottom lip. you can't go wrong with these glosses. ",2
"Got a sample of this and loved it, but when it absorbs, not so much. Cologne is such a personal preference kind of thing. I got the small bottle and will wear it but probably with another fragrance to layer it with. ",4
"Got a sample of this shampoo in an order and gave it a try. Fantastic for thin, damaged hair like mine. Smells fabulous, makes my hair look as good as it has in ages and I love it. Bought the shampoo and a heat protective treatment and am thrilled with both. ",3
"Gotta have it. And now my 80 yr. old mom loves it too. My skin is a normal combination, with some light oiliness in the T-Zone. Whether it's needed or not, I love to put it on. Minimizes pores too ! It's a neccessary object.",4
"Got the gift set for my birthday and was immediately taken with the scent. I get compliments all the time. Unfortunately, I just tried to order the gift set and it's sold out. I'm going to order the perfume for my daughter. If I'm lucky it won't go with her chemistry, and she'll give it to me. ",4
Got these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. They are the perfect size to tuck in a pocket and gives her a chance to try out the colors. We both use the regular size of Buxom lip glosses and it's the only kind we buy now. Great product! ,3
"Got this as an early Christmas present, and it smells amazing! I love the combination scents, and my hubby loves it even more! Layering the scents (body wash, lotion and parfum) really helps the scent last all day. ",0
"'Got this for my daughter for when she goes away yo college. The container will be good to put in her toiletries basket for trip to the dorm shower/bathroom. The price is good and it will not ""break the bank"" should the set, or parts of it, have to be replaced. ",3
"Great all around collection. The mix of cream and powder eye shadows are great, and there is a great selection for blending colors. However, some of the things I know I'll never use. Specfically the eyeliner and some of the brushes. Those of us who are Sephora junkies most likely already have much better quality items. I did notice that some of the eyeshadows look much brighter in the palette than on your skin, so don't be afraid to use the bold colors! ",1
"Great brush....Works well at seperating and reaching ALL lashes. The formula, however leaves little to be desired. If used in moderation [5-8 swipes of the brush] then you'll be amazed at how well this does! any more than that and lashes become cumbersome, sticky, and slow drying. ",0
"great buy... but definitely doesn't leave your skin flawless as what this package promised. Everything in the package is great except for the mineral powder... seems like the ""look"" looks better w/out the loose powder. All in all, it is a nice gift set. ",1
"Great cleanser, smells like a fresh orange and doesnt leave skin tight or dry. My skin is oily in the t-zone yet dry on my cheeks. This stuff works great for balancing out my face. Doesnt cause breakouts and doesnt cause dryness! what else do you need! Plus my skin always looks brighter and refreshed after using this stuff. Definately recommend!",0
"Great color. I love both the color and the coverage of this lipgloss. I wish they used a sponge applicator, but I really like the color on me so I can put up with the brush. The color is great on my medium brown complexion. And when I want to kick it up a notch, I use Smashbox's lip pencil in Gash as a liner and all over... dramatic, dark reddish lips. Love it! ",2
"Great concept: lip exfoliant/moisturizer in a lipstick style packaging with a good size mirror. Great style of the product and great portability makes this a unique as well as a very useful product. However, the exfoliant side felt very hard and rough ironically it did actually exfoliate the lips well. I ended up using the balm side of this stick. ",1
"Great flavour, but then again I am not 8 yrs old. I found the colour uneven , unless you put a lot of product on. I also found the formula stick and my lips didn't glide easily over my teeth when I spoke. Love the scent. ",1
"Great for girls with light brows but darker hair. I only use the brunette color on the left side, as the one on the right side is too dark for me. It would be 5 stars if I could get that color only. I get tons of compliments on my brows too!",0
Great for travel. Especially like the eye shadow. Blush brush is too soft -- ineffective. Next edition: different blush selection. Hot pink is too extreme --others are too pale Lipsticks are ok. Well priced. ,4
"Great Foundation. Covers well - better than any Ive tried so far and trust me, Ive tried a lot. Just cant give it 5 stars cuz Im still on the hunt for that PERFECT foundation - still havent found it!! ",0
"Great foundation, not too thick but not too thin. Great way to start your face before applying powder. Wish packaging was in a soft tube so it's easier to travel with but the product is top of the line! ",1
"Great fragrance that lasts. I have never been able to wear musk and other bass notes that make fragrances last. One of the few ""white flower"" fragrances that holds it's scent all day. Tiare is unique and you have to like it in order to love this scent as I do. The most similar scent is tuberose. ",4
"Great gift and great value! The powder eye shadows are very high quality... cream powder texture, good pigmentation, blendable without flaking or creashing. Also beautiful selection of shades. The blushes are ok... nice color selction but be sure and apply loose powder first so they do not ""grab"" on the skin. Also always use professional qulaity brushes, not the ones included with palettes as they tend to be low quality and ""shed"". if you use professional applicatos (other Sephora brushes sold separately), you'll be pleased with the palette. The lipsticks and glosses are ok but I buy tjis for myself and give as gifts for the eyeshadow and blush range. ",4
"Great gloss, feels light on your lips, tastes like cherries. 4 stars because the cherry oil makes it tingly, which some people might not like. I have a cool complexion, and the light purple looks great on me. ",0
"Great gloss... not sticky and very moisturizing... creamy with a very light pleasant scent... works very well over lipstick too... the color I have is very natural and pretty, but I will try one with shimmer next. ",3
"great herbal fragrance, nice lather and gentle on my color. I have been using this daily and the scent helps wake me up a little in the morning at 5:30am. I like the texture of my hair after using it and it's a good lather to wash out all the buildup from styling products but still gentle. ",2
Great highlighter i always have problems with cream based makeup but this is the only thing that does not streak or melt or nothing it stays on and makes you glow its the best also for eyeshadow base !!! ,0
"great in defining, volumizing, lengthening and great color of a very rich deep black like the product is officially described above. i usually apply one layer, curl and apply a second layer and add to the tips of my lashes and it looks like a very very full set of eyelashes, so nicely defined and lengthened that it looks so close to false lashes. most def. recommend!",0
Great look for the workplace. Applies easily and makes eyes look like they were done by a professional. I have to agree with a previous reviewer - All colors are not used equally. The palette should be designed so that there is more color for LIDS and less for the OUTER CORNER. I recommend this for anyone who wants to look polished rather than 'made up' or trendy. ,4
"Great mascara for achieving high definition lashes quickly. It tends to clump a bit, but if you comb out the lashes after allowing the mascara to dry, then that takes care of most of the clumping issues. The black shade is the best for achieving mega lashes, which this product provides! ",1
"great nail polish....purchased the shade ""gimme shelter"" and have had sooo many compliments.....i usually wear the opi brand and this stays on just as well.....it seems to have a nice gloss in it even before the top coat is applied.....super product i will purchase again! ",3
Great product. A little certainly goes a long way. I live in the south and I never leave the house without sunscreen - this product combines the best of both worlds. It makes you skin a little bit oily if you use too much - but definitely worth the investment! ,1
Great product! I always take one when travelling and keep another in my make-up bag. This product is in pencil form but creamy enough to use under eyes or to cover any lines or flaws. It's blendable but stays where you put it. Use it to outline outside the lipline and use a lip pencil within the lipline close to the shade of your lips or lipstick for a fabulous lip liner... no bleeding even with bright or deep reds. Also camouflages fine lines around the kip line! ,4
"Great product - I dust this over my face after using a spot concealer and my skin looks nearly flawless. Unlike other compact powder formulas, this one turns into a loose powder the minute a brush is swiped over it and tends to be messy. i can deal with the messy part; however, it seems as though more ends up on my bathroom vanity than on my face :-) still, it's a great product which i intend to order again. ",2
"GREAT PRODUCT. I have tried every eye cream out there and this one dominates. It has a wonderful velvety texture and reduces my dark circles, which is a miracle in itself, but it also reduces puffiness and fine lines. This is the only eyecream you will ever need. ",1
"Great product. It is very moisturizing, without being greasy. I use it immediately after I get out of the shower and it soaked right in and and made my skin feel so soft. I think all moisturizers work better if you warm them in your hands first. The fragrance is clean and light. ",3
"Great product selection or starter kit for those who haven't tried these items from Benefit before... But not great for those who already have and don't need all of the items. Highbeam, lift and lemon-aid are the best, but couldn't definitely do without the other two. The lip plump doesn't plump and I just plain don't like it, and the boi-ing is too dark for my skin and isn't really good at blending... also it dries out pretty quick after you've opened it for the first time. So my advice, only get this if you want a quick way to try a bunch of Benefit products. ",1
"Great product! Smells good, leaves my combination skin clean but not dry and works as a makeup remover so one less bottle to travel with. Has worked for me in widely varying climates and goes through airport security with ease. Even my boyfriend loves it for himself and now my thirteen year old son is using it, too. It is great for all of us. ",2
"Great product. Smells terrific - not overly fruit-y, not icky sweet - a light, fresh scent that I hope Bliss will keep forever (but am stockpiling in case they don't). Best moisturizer I have ever found for ""lizard legs."" Nice buttercream texture, non-greasy. Outstanding value - a small amount goes a long way & keeps my skin looking & feeling smooth all day. ",4
"Great redness coverage. One of the best SPFs for a powder foundation. The best powder foundation I've tried yet. Be sure to moisturize if you're normal to dry - this powder will tell on you! I give 4 stars because I believe CD could add more shades. Also, takes practice to apply evenly. ",3
Great results! I freak out about the thought of aging skin. I feel like this one has a noticable (not irritating though) amount of vitamin C in it. This serum made my skin look and feel noticeably better. It's another great Ole Henriksen product... I think I'm getting addicted to their skin products.,1
Great scrub with some salicylic acid added to really help reduce that oil in those hard to reach places. Great for mild to moderate backne and for those little bumps on the backs of the arms. Also makes a terrific foot scrub without the tickling!,2
GREAT SEPARATION & VOLUME!!!! THIS MASCARA RANKS RIGHT UP THERE WITH LANCOME DEFINICILS. I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE EYES & THIS MASCARA DIDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL. I'VE TRIED DIOR SHOW & HAD A TERRIBLE REACTION BUT NOT WITH THIS ONE. IT'S A MUST TRY! ,2
"Great shade of gold, perfect either over or under a darker shade to add shine and a soft gold tone. Feels very nice also. The gold loose powder is very subtle and can be used alone as a eye shadow or as an all over subtle glow. Not too glittery! Cute gold clutch (very small!) ",4
great smell and the gel formula gives your skin a silky texture...I have'nt used toner for awhile but after buying this -I I remebered how using the right skin cleaning products and process makes the difference. ,2
"Great stuff -- it really does do what it says, and locks down even your smudgiest non-waterproof eyeliners. The only downside is that some colors may end up streaking off a little bit when you apply this, but it's layerable -- just touch up a bit more liner over the thin spots when it's dry and then reapply the sealant. This is going to be a permanent staple in my makeup kit! ",2
Great style aid. This can be put on damp hair to help with defining curl while drying or to make hair smooth. I also use it when my hair is dry to just add a little more definition. A little goes a long way and is well worh the cost. ,2
Great to have both the wax and color in one pencil. I have pale brows that need flling as well as a better shape. The wax helps keep the powder on for the extension of my brows. Nice color of taupe for fair blondes like myself. Bought one for my sister as a gift after I tried it and loved it. ,3
"Great value for the money. I like this cream. I think it is beneficial for depuffing and hydration. My dark circles tend to get less pronounced when I get enough sleep and watch my alcohol consumption so its hard to say how much a cream actually contributes, but overall its a silky, fast absorbing cream that lives up to Korres quality. ",1
Great value. Products last a long time -- not skimpy amounts. Love the entire package and they led me to other products in the line. Can tell a difference in my skins texture and in fewer underskin blemishes and those tiny oil deposits in the oily areas. ,4
"Great way to find your perfect mascara, I love the bad gal lash and will buy it now that I know. I would never have tried it on my own, this gave me a great opportunity to buy several brands and test them at a low low price. ",3
"Guava lipstick is moisturizing, long wearing and works well under their more sheer lipsicks or glosses. If you love Korres but have had a had time with the need to apply and re-apply the mango butter lipsticks, try this underneath. ",3
"Had seen a rave about this product in InStyle so ordered it from Sephora and WOW is this mascara something! My eyelashes are SO long and gorgeous with this mascara it's amazing. They're almost too long for work but fabulous for evenings out. I'm sold on this mascara, it's really amazing. ",3
"Had to practice a bit to get it right. At first, my brows would come out too dark. However, I've learned that a little goes a long way and even though they may look light under the lights and the stencil, the end result ist just lovely.\n\nI start with a light powdering with the lighter shade, then I just dip my angle brush in the dark shade and dot at the places where my own brows are non-existant. The results are natural.\n\nA face lift in a little pot.",4
"Hands down, Nars oil free is the only liquid foundation I will ever be using. when you first apply it the consistency is very odd, and it will look cakey, but within minutes of applying it it will look flawless and beautiful on your skin. Well worth the money. ",0
"Hands down, this is the best concealer! I have even used this as foundation when I was caught one day without any foundation. It does a great job at covering blemishes, blends well, and helps rid the blemish! I usually apply on my blemish before bed and the next day I kid you not, the blemish is dried out! ",0
"Has a good rating on the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics site (i.e. no lead etc.) And the colors are fabulous. The taste isn't very pronounced and doesn't make me choke like some brands do. In fact, I'm barely aware of it, very comfortable to wear. ",3
"Have 3 of these pencils: 1999, Bourbon, and Rockstar and already have wish-listed more colors. They are very easy use, can be smudged right after you apply but then stay in place all day. Ready to ditch the rest of my eyeliners!",2
"Have always loved Bare Minerals foundation but have never tried the eye makeup for whatever reason. Finally did and was not dissapointed. Truly love the feel, the look and the ease of putting it on. I am getting lots of positive feedback from coworkers and friends. ",3
have been using this product for just a few weeks now so am not sure I have seen complete results but at my age I was noticing my skin was getting dryer and not feeling soft so thought I would try thiis - like others I have sensitive skin and did the skin test first and had no reaction. I willsay that although I havent seen a decrease in lines etc but at my age maybe that is wishful thinking!!! I have noticed my skin is alot softer and looks better. And its a good value for getting both for the price of one! ,4
"Have colored hair and hard water and my hair was beginning to feel like straw. All it takes is a small amount of this and my hair is easy to comb out, much more managable, softer, shinier and seems overall much healthier. Expensive, but worth it. ",3
"Have found a few products that treat razor burn including one by Jack Black, TendSkin, and Anthony Logisitics. Anthony's brand is by far the best. IT WORKS after just a few usages. Not messy, goes on clear, doesn't burn like TendSkin does. Just a small amount every day. This product WORKS.",1
"haven't been able to use anything else other than this powder. It gives great coverage and doesn't make yourface look dry as other powders do. As a former makeup artist, I would definately advise this! ",3
"Haven't I read somewhere that the most Beautiful Women are from Iceland. Anyway, I was happily surprised. My skin is ageing and prone to break-outs. These products actually addressed both issues without harsh chemicals. I will definitely buy again. ",4
"Have tried other Fusion products before & was disappointed; tried this only because ""GJ"" gave it a thumbs up. Sorry; maybe this is because there are really NO lip plumpers out there that REALLY work; some do plump temporarily (maybe a few hrs. at most), but that's it - have tried many myself. It does moisturize, however, and does plump to a degree for a few hrs. which makes it about the same as all the rest, only pricier! ",4
"Have used other ""high end"" products that are similiar in their description of this product. That's where it ends. This mask is the BOMB. Hair has never felt or looked better. The shine comes from within. Love it & will definitely will re-rder when my jar is almost empty Don't want to have it on back-oder. Ladies who color their hair should give this a try. ",4
Have used this product for over two years every night and have not found another anti-aging night cream to match its performance.....and I have tried. Hope they do not discontinue this one.........Love it. ,4
Having a stash of 10 different mascaras to choose from is a great idea. I have them all in a little container and grab a different one each morning. They are all good products and helpful in choosing your favorite one. I haven't found a single one that I don't enjoy. ,3
"Having been a LONG time Lancome/Defincils user....I was hesitant to change. But I LOVE Clinique's High Impact Mascara. Being a contact wearer is also a big issue, but it stays put and does not clump. Big thumbs up!",4
"Having oily skin it has always been a challenge to keep eyeshadow from creasing, or sliding off of my eyes, I tried foundation but that felt heavy; powder was also a failure. I found this product in a beauty magazine, very highly rated. I bought a bottle, took it home and tried it out and my response was Eureka! This product is simply wonderful. It is weightless, dries quickly, shadow and liner does not 'pull' while being applied, but this primer quietly, and invisibly does it's job; keeping your make-up perfectly beautiful all day and night long. No make-up bag would be complete without this product. ",3
"Having said that, the ""light purple"" is NOT light purple - it's pink. Nice shade, just not light purple. The plum is very pigment intense. This gloss moisturizes better than any other product I have tried. Not sticky/gooey at all. Color lasts a long time. ",2
"Heard great reviews about this blush so I thought I'd give it a try, plus I had an online coupon for Sephora so it made it well worth the test. It definitely passed! It stands up to all the great reviews and is really a wonderful blush.",0
"Hello VOLUME! I change my mascara like I change my shoes, OFTEN! I love this mascara! It can go from natural looking to DRAMATIC with a couple of strokes...it's a beautiful thing! Oh wait, that's me....wink ;) ",0
"Here is your chance to try some of the bigger names. They are not waterproof, -which is my preference, but EACH has great virtues. Easier to remove as well. Cant loose, no bad ones here. Nice sizes for trials and purse. ",4
Here's your answer. Works wonderfully.I used Brightening anti-perspirant . Saw results after 1 month. It is so gentle. I have sensitive skin. Pron to allergic reactions. Zero reactions w.this amazing product. Just purchased again this month. 10 stars from me. Great product. Noe more dark ugly underarm.,2
"High SPF, great. Water-resistant , great for working out. Lightweight, great. Goes on very smooth, great. Only improvement could be just a little more coverage (can['t believe this was too much for some; this is a very light, sheer product, but it doesn't have quite enough to even out skin tone). Would love to see this improved; it would be my one & only. ",4
"Hi,\n\nI purchased this in ""Soft Brown"", and it was a fairly close (not exact) match for my very dark brows. I am going to give the next shade down, ""Deep Brown"", or even the ""Brown/Black"", a try next time.\n\nThe routine that I have found to work best for me is to first pencil this into the sparse areas of my brows, it draws on pencil-thin - and if you want to, you can almost mimic the appearance of individual brow hairs. I then take my BareMinerals Brow Powder (GREAT PRODUCT - FIVE STARS), in Brunette, and brush/blend it on top as a shader/filler. The outcome of this combination of products is always very natural and flattering on me - or so I have been told :-)\n\nAll of this being said, I just want to add that I have to agree with the above reviewer on a couple of points:\n\n1.) The product goes on very nicely (Superfine, as advertised), and looks totally natural. It is probably, out of all the Brow Pencils that I have tried to date, the absolute best in regards to both application and appearance!\n\n2.) Unfortunately, the only strike against this product is that it runs out all too quickly. The above reviewer was correct in stating that three weeks of daily use would be about it for length of use. Because I do not use eye makeup on a daily basis, it usually takes me quite a while to go through my products - so - I was totally shocked one day to find that I was at the end of my Superfine Brow Liner! I couldn't believe that I had gone through it so quickly!\n\nIn conclusion - I have to say that this is a very nice, natural-looking product for your brows. It goes on easily, blends beautifully, and I would say that it is definitely a keeper!\n\nThe ONLY reason why I am only giving this product four stars is due to the fact that it runs out way too quickly. Even though the price is good, I feel as though the product should/could be lasting longer than it does. Thus far, this seems to be the only negative - although - if they give us more product, then they will probably raise the price accordingly.\nHalf a dozen one, six the other - as they say!\n\nOh well! It is a great product, and I will definitely be re-purchasing it (in a darker shade) in the very near future!",3
"HINT is the PERFECT ""go to"" BLUSHER! It is a natural hint of color that gives you a healthy, warm glow. Do NOT judge this shade (or any of the Cheek Colors) by photo swatches or how they look in pans. They all are beautiful shades on, extremely wearable, apply smoothly, never grabbing, are highly blendable and last ALL Day. HINT is a great basic shade for everyone with Fair to Medium Dark complexions. It is almost impossible to apply too much of this shade! Primer under foundation/ tinted moisturizer and a light dusting of translucent powder before applying blush, will provide all day wear to anyone who experiences product fading. ",4
"Holy Cats! Talk about tasty colors that make a sexy statement ... this is THE palette for blues. Love that bright white, that deep, dark black and the silver is shimmery cream ... totally cool. What are you waiting for? Buy it immediately! ",3
"Honestly, I don't like the name ""Urban Decay"", because I believe strongly in the power of words. BUT, I also believe in this product. I have oily skin and have always had problems with creasing. I wear a soft black eyeshadow, but I blend very well for the smoky look. Since I started using this ""potion"" it never creased again!! I even use it under my lower lashes for my eyeliner. Oily skinned girls unite! We have finally found the answer to the creasing!!! I wish they would consider changing their name though! ",2
"Honestly, there's nothing I can find to dislike about this miosturizer. The spf is a little higher than most products in this catagory, it's buildable so I can put on a second coat for more coverage if I like and still look natural, it has excellent skincare ingredients and it's lightweight enough for me to not even feel that I'm wearing it. I can use it under my powder make up, or go without the make up if I'm in a hurry or I just don't feel like it. I can wear this alone occasionally if I don't have time to do my usual skincare routine and still feel that I've got the basic skincare essentials to get me through the day. This stuff even has a light pleasent scent! ",3
Hope in a jar has been a great discovery for me. This moisturizer is lightweight and still moisturizes my skin perfectly. I've always had a hard time finding a product with both these attributes. Eureka!!!,2
"Hourglass's Veil Mineral Primer applied smoothly and felt great on my skin. My foundation looked great at first when applied overtop of this primer, but the oil started to break through in no time at all. I have very oily skin and this primer just couldn't handle it. I think this would be better for someone with normal to dry skin.",2
"HOW CAN YOU RATE SOMETHING THAT IS GUILT FREE,HAS NO CALORIES,AND NON-FAT?NOT TO MENTION WHEN YOU CRAVE SUGAR ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SMELL YOUR SCENTED BODY OR AS I DO KEEP THE BOTTLE NEAR THE COOKIE JAR TO AVOID TEMPTATION, AFTER A SHOWER I SMELL HEAVENLY AND THE BATHROOM SMELLS LIKE A BAKERY! THE PACKAGE SHOULD HAVE A WARNING TEMPTING BUT DO NOT EAT! SEPHORA: How about room spray and candles? ",4
How could anyone ever live without BE Get Started Kit? It's beyond me. I've never had so many compliments in my life since I started wearing BE. I think it's got some magic in it's powder to make your inner beauty come shining through. All it takes is a few minutes a day to turn blotchy skin into perfect skin with a healthy glow. 'nuff said! ,4
"However, remember to use a base/primer, such as concealer, underneath ALL eye shadow. This added step allows the pigment in eye shadow to adhere to something stable; the skin is not stable, moisture is lost and/or gained throughout the day. Follow this makeup tip and I promise the eye shadow will stay in place all day! ",1
Hypnotic Poison is in a class all its own. It' the best perfume I've ever owned. I've used it for years and hope they never quit making it. It's very soft scented and I receive more compliments from men and women alike. Simply the best!,2
"Hypnotic Poison is nothing like the fruity original poison. This is my absolute fave!!!! I have been wearing it for years, people always ask and compliment. It is not too strong, but definately dark, sexy, and mysterious.",2
"Hypnotic Poisons is one of those perfumes that have a very unique smell that some people either really love or really hate. I've heard Hypnotic Poison described as ""Pure Poison's trashy sister."" If by ""trashy,"" you mean ""deep, warm, sweet, strong, and sexy,"" then yes, Hypnotic Poison is indeed ""trashy.""\n\nHypnotic Poison calls to mind a sultry temptress on a cool night. It has a very distinct, strong bitter jasmine/almond impression in the beginning and warms down to a woody vanilla. It's a very sexy, sensual progression, and it last for a long time. I would have to say that I mainly wear this on cool evening outings,and I get complemented every time. :)",0
"I absolutely cannot use this as a leave-in conditioner. even the tiniest bit weighs my hair down. BUT if you have coarser hair, I would definitely try this, as it is quite moisturizing, as it is a dense formulation. ",2
I absolutely hate it! The consistency was like jello which was repulsive and then i could taste it from my lips and it tasted like cherry cough syrup. I don't like stains to begin with but this was just awful. ,0
"I absolutely looove this. My skin is really weird. Dry patches and kinda tight, but very oily. Also, my skin is bumpy, but not super pimpley or anything. But this stuff works WONDERS on my face. It makes my face soft, smooth, NOT OILY!!! and doesn't cause any flareups. It's incredibly amazing.",0
"I absolutely love Amazing Grace...I love the smell of it, for some reason it brings me back to my childhood. It's got a great clean scent and while I could spend less money on a body wash I absolutely will splurge on this all the time!",1
"I absolutely love Glitter Eyes by Sephora. I originally bought it because I had seen glitter mascara in a limited edition by another brand at a department store. However, that was sold out, and I later saw this kit online and just had to have it. I get so many compliments every time I wear this. And the picture instructions on the package make it so easy to use. It really delivers what it promises, and it lasts all night long. I would recommend Glitter Eyes to everyone, and I hope Sephora comes out with more palettes like this!!!!! ",0
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Nars blush in 0rgasm! It matches every skin tone and stays on all day. Plus it has a tiny bit of sparkle to give you just enough glow while still looking natural. I've recommended it to all of my girlfriends and they now use it too...,0
"I absolutely love love love this powder -- it is so gentle and fine, it makes my skin feel soft & perfect.. it mattifies my skin without drying it out AND minimizes my pores. i can't see how i've lived so long without it =) go to a sephora & try it for yourself, you will be soldd. ",0
"I absolutely love Nars everything, so its only natural that I started using the blush. I started using Luster during the summer for a peach-y glow and it looks great with the Laguna bronzer. I definitely recommend it!",0
I absolutely love pink sugar...like everyone else the first time I smelt it i was in love...I've been using it ever since and all around me enjoy the pleasant sweet smells that come from my direction...I would recommend anyone to use this product!!,1
"I absolutely love the brown sugar body polish. It makes your skin feel so clean and soft. The smell is to die for, its almost like it should be used in the kitchen. I always make sure I have this product during winter months for my skin when it gets dry because of the cold weather.",1
I absolutely love the Buxom Lips. They plump without burning and the colors are beautifully sheer. I honestly don't think you could goof in picking a color. And the shine is gorgeous and it lasts. Highly recommend.,3
"I absolutely love the fresh, clean fragrance. I am amazed with its staying power and enjoy the compliments that are always forthcoming when I wear it, which is practically each day. I don't imagine ever tiring of ""Amazing Grace"". ",4
I absolutely love these blushes. I own O~gasm and DOLCE VITA and I love them both. O~rgasm is a pretty peachy pink and Dolce Vita a cinnamon pink that looks very natural but is highly pigmented beware little goes a long way. Overall these are the best blushes I have ever owned.....highly recommended.,0
"i absolutely love the smell of the Truth serum!!! ill use it alone during the summer and my skin looks and feels fantastic. i wish it would last longer. i end up using the serum up faster but the transformation cream makes my skin soo soft and ill even use it to set my eyeshadows lipliners, mix with concealer ect... i dont always use the night cream but def buy this set for the total value",0
I absolutely LOVE this blush! Angelika is a beautiful bright pink with silver shimmer and if you use it lightly it gives you a soft natural flush as if you just came in from the cold! Very highly pigmented. Make sure to tap your brush after dipping. This is one of the best blushes I have ever used! NARS is a classic when it comes to blush.,1
"I absolutely love this brush. Living in a extremely warm climate, I only use a bronzer during the day. This brush makes the bronzer look so natural. Only one thing that would make this ""THE PERFECT BRONZER BRUSH"" and that would be to have the bristles retractable. ",4
I absolutely love this concealer. I have very bad allergies which usually come with dark circles under my eyes and this concealer does a fantastic job of hiding that darkness. It is very moisturizing and I just LOVE it! ,1
"I absolutely love this conditioner! I have very fine, frizz-prone hair and Shear Splendor gives it volume, shine, and movement. It works best if you comb it through your hair and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing. It also has the best lemon meringue-y smell and the price is right. ",1
"I absolutely love this eyeliner!! I've always wanted to master the cats-eye look, and learn how to use liquid eyeliner, but usually for me, the brush is too long and flexible, so I have a hard time drawing a precise line. Not with this liner!! This eyeliner has a felt tip, and it's soft enough for the delicate eye area, but firm enough to draw really precise lines just along the lash line. I had no problem with the application, and I didn't even need a makeup professional's help! You can even change the angle of the brush to make the line thicker or thinner. Also, I haven't had any problems with smudging, even when I rub my eyes. ",0
"I absolutely love this eyeshadow palette. Every color is so flattering on and it's a great value for how many shades you get. Wear a shade alone or mix with another to create a different look. Not to mention, it's in such a cute package. Must-have! ",0
"I absolutely love this foundation. It's sooooooooo lightweight, sheer coverage, and it even smells good. A little goes a loooooooooooooooong way. Also, it practically melts into skin. The only downside is it's a little pricey for a student's budget. ",0
I absolutely LOVE this fragrance. It is my all-time favorite. My husband got this for me and it is the only fragrance I completely used up and wanted more! It is very soft and not over-powering. I always get compliments when I wear it.,1
"I absolutely love this. It's the first cleansing oil I've ever tried and I've fallen in love. I usually have to take off my makeup with a remover before I actually wash my face. This saves me that step (and many cotton pads). It takes every trace of makeup... good-bye, 10 coats of waterproof mascara! ",0
"I absolutely love this lip gloss! I am not usually a big fan of lipstick or lip gloss because I don't like the feeling of it on my lips, but this product was very sheer, non-sticky, and provided a lovely color and luster (I got it in creamy rose and it goes on smoothly and beautifully). ",0
I absolutely love this makeup. It couldn't be easier to use and it never goes bad. Plus the variety of colors is just stunning. I can never get enough of these. They're so versatile and can look so different depending on whether they're wet or dry. I will always recommend Bare Escentuals shadows and blushes. ,3
"I absolutely love this makeup remover - especially since I wear eye makeup that includes waterproof mascara on a daily basis. It removes all of it without tugging and pulling, does not dry out the delicate skin around the eyes (and for a woman of 50+ - that is a must!) and it has no unpleasant side effects like it does not blur your vision like many of the oil based products and no smell. I love it and highly recommend it. I make sure I never run out... ",3
I absolutely love this mascara. It's very silky and doesn't cause my eyelashes to break off like so many other mascaras have in the past. It builds nicely if I use two or three coats for a more dramatic look and doesn't clump. I also love that it's a moisturizing mascara. I feel like I'm actually doing something good for my lashes. It creates dramatically thicker and longer lashes that are soft to the touch and not stiff. I highly recommend this product. ,1
I absolutely love this mascara. Of course the ball tip is different than anything we've tried before - hence the reason I HAD to try it!! I love this mascara. Since the first day I tried it my lashes have that gorgeous fanned out effect with volume and length. I love the fact that there are no black specks beneath my eyes at the end of the day. I'll buy it again - but I'd love if it were also offered in a navy shade - hint hint !!! ,3
"I absolutely love this perfume, even though so many wear it. It's the epitome of clean, yet it still has a light musk that says sexy. It's floral, but more citrus than sweet. I get sweet, true apple and dryer sheets, too. Smells amazing. Lasts all day and into the night. Well worth the money.",1
"I absolutely love this perfume. I always get so many complements on it. If you are a fan of anything vanilla, you'll love this one. Its also one perfume that I think actually lasts throughout the day. I totally reccommend buying Pink Sugar.",0
i absolutely love this perfume! i cannot tell you how many compliments i get when i wear this.. my boyfriend absolutely loves this fragrance on me as well. it is definitely fresh and floral. i wear it everyday. i am definitely getting another bottle when my other runs out!,0
I absolutely love this product. Have used it for 4 years and am very happy to see that Sephora is now carrying it and I don't have to order it now and pay shipping and handling. This is also great for covering small brown spots.,4
I absolutely love this product. I especially like the pump because you waste less than the regular bottle. It is a great everyday lotion and as part of the 3-step system. I get many compliments on my skin from the 3-step and using this product. My skin glows. ,3
I absolutely love this product. I have veryvery oily eyelids and eyeshadow always ends up melting into the crease of my eye. With this product my eyeshadow actually stays until I take it off. It is amazing and I have tried lots of eye primers. None of them work as good as this one does. ,2
"I absolutely love this product. It exfoliates all the dead, dry skin from your lips, and moisturizes them, leaving them plump, moist and soft. try it. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. And you can't beat the price. ",3
I absolutely LOVE this product. It's especially great for ink. I have several tats on my legs and when I rub this over them they look wet and vibrant and stay that way all day. I also like that it's not greasy. ,3
"I absolutely love this product! I've tried many high end moisturizers and this one hydrates 50 + year old skin beautifully. It is not greasy, does not just sit on the top layer of your skin, it absorbs quickly, deep into the skin and really keeps it soft and moist all day. Thank you Shiseido, I'm hooked now! ",4
I absolutely love this scent. I am a perfume junkie so I bought this without smelling it first and I am not disappointed. I love the coconut smell and it softens after a little bit. The bottle is very cute. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that the smell doesn't stay on for as long as some of my other fragrances. I still ordered Baby though. ,2
I absolutely LOVE this scent - it smells so fresh it's like you just stepped out of the shower only better. So many perfumes out there smell so strong and are many times offensive - this scent is soft and pleasant - get many compliments and inquiries as to which scent it is when I wear it.,2
"I absolutely love this serum! I have oily, acneic skin that also happens to be sensitive - and this serum seems to tackly all of these problems. One of the best moisturizers I've used, this is light but still effective. It does not cause breakouts and soothes my skin when it feels irritated. Especially good used alone during the summer months, yet can be layered during colder, dryer months.",1
"i absolutely love this stuff! it makes my hair so shiny and smooth with such a small amount! i bought a travel size about 2 month ago and i still have a ton left... and i use it every day! a little goes a long way! i like to put a little in before i blow dry, and then a tiny bit after on my ends. it really makes a big difference with fly-aways and shine. ",0
I absolutely love this stuff! Its the only thing that has ever worked. I use KP duty EVERYDAY sometimes 3x a day and it amazingly works. It has to be used regularly to keep those nasty bumps away...or they will come back...,1
"I absolutely SWEAR by this product! It makes your skin glow with a dewy radiance! I would love the opportunity to represent this company because I believe in it so much! It would be a dream job! All of Caudalie's products are great, but this one is Magical!",0
I absolutly love this product. It's easy to apply. After applying it I dab my face with a cosmetic sponge. It looks so very natural and covers blemishes. I would recomend this product to a friend. It's a little on the pricey side but at 38 years old it's worth the expense.,2
"I actually bought this for me becuase I love lipgloss and mostly i love ""Michael"" perfume. I thought it would be great to carry in my purse! Everytime I would use it, my friends thought it was so cute and they loved it! I ended up getting 4 for my friends for Chistmas! i love this! It shoiuld be available all year long! ",1
"I actually bought this to use as an eyeshadow, and ended up using it all over my face!!! In the summer I would use it as eyeliner, eyeshadow, bronzer and blush and come out looking gorgeous and summer shimmer-y. The shimmer is incredible and it goes on deliciously sheer so you can really play with it. Love it!! ",0
"I actually felt for the hype surrrounding this product! As, I honestly though that it would be all that and more. And, I once again ended up being disappointed.\n\nThis product does have a scent to it and it didn't take off all of my makeup on the first try (so I would have to wash my face twice with this stuff). And, I don't care for its runny consistency too much either.",1
"I actually first smelled Cashmere Mist in a (gasp) magazine...I rarely open the flaps to test a fragrance.\nI fell in love. It's a scent that carries you from day to night\nwithout missing a beat. I've received numerous compliments on the fragrance, overwhelmingly from men.\nNeedless to say it is my daily fragrance. Thank you DK.",4
"I actually have 2 cleansing regimens as my skin is oilier on some days than on others. On my oilier days I use this cleanser with very good results. Thorough cleansing without stripping, and I follow this with Pick Me Up Tonic. Leaves my skin very soft, not oily, not dry. Although I use it on oily days, this would work well for any skin type. Lovely fragrant product.",4
"I actually liked this product. I don't use it everyday though. I really only use for occasions when I'm wearing make-up a little heavier than usual. I like the eye spackle because it really smoothes out the eyelid and makes color go on really well and a little deeper than ususal. I've never had a problem with it creasing. I like the lip spackle too, but once again, only for heavy lipstick. I haven't had a problem with it changing the way my lipstick wears off, just depends on which stick/gloss/stain I use. ",0
"I actually meant to buy the soap for oily skin, but ended up buying the mild version by accident. It still works great and helps keep my face clear.\n\nThe pump can be turned to a locked position so you don't accidentally dispense anything.",1
I actually really like this powder. it doesn't make me breakout at all and it's SO lightweight!! one bad thing is i have to apply it again in the middle of the day because my face does get oily and shiny. ,0
I actually really love this product especially when I want my foundation to look flawless. Also being an esthetician I was concerned with something like this being pore clogging but it was smooth silky and not at all heavy.,1
"I actually tried this product after reading reviews of it at Sephora. I'm so happy with the product I bought another color and blend them together. Although it does feel sticky going on, it dries so smooth and there's none of that powder look you get from other blushes. It truly is a natural look and stays on ALL day! I would recommend this to anyone. It's a great product and from the size of it, looks like it'll last a very long time! ",3
"I adore, adore, adore this fragrance and so does everyone who comes into contact with it -- especially men. It dries down to a fabulous, sensual base that lasts all day or night. The body mousse is also long lasting, and the massage oil to die for.",4
"I adore Nars lipsticks in general, but Masai is my ultimate favorite. I alternate colors and formulas depending on the time of year, but have been faithfully using Masai for over three years now. It is amazing how long lasting and moisturizing a sheer lipstick can be. I sometimes layer it over a darker, matte lipstick, thereby creating my own personal color.",3
"I adore Nars products. and when I was searching for a talc-free powder that matched my in between warm and cool fair skin, I was delighted to find Snow, a shade that worked beautifully and didn't turn me yellow/orange. it is a very light, very fine powder, great for touch-ups. however, the packaging on this powder is terrible. the very shallow pan encourages product breakage with just normal use, and the enclosed applicator, which performs great at first, has no longevity. these reasons are the only drawbacks to a lovely product that I would gladly purchase again if it were packaged more sensibly. if you are looking for a powder to have in your desk drawer that you pull out for touch-ups, it would work fine. but I need my make up to be portable and to stand up to daily use. I wish I could recommend this product, as the formulation is magnificent. ",2
I adore Philosophy but this one didn't work for me. It was way too orange and it had a strange consistency that did not go away. Even hours later when I touched my face it felt slimey and got very shiney. ,2
"I adore sugary, sweet smells. I read so many rave reviews I had to try it. On me, It smells like a sugary, cotton candy scented version of Raid bug spray. Apparently on other review sites I've seen a small amount of people experience it smelling...like bug spray! I guess it depends on body chemistry. My friends or my mom its smelled awesome on. The nasty part fades with time though. An hour later you mostly smell the sugary sweet.",0
"I adore the blush color O. It's the perfect flush. The texture of the powder is smooth and it is long lasting. It does have a bit of shimmer, but it's not overwhelming. I don't usually like shimmer because it makes me look greasy.",1
I adore this cleaser! It's nice and foamy and really gentle. I can use just one pump and it disintigrates my makeup. It really gets mascara off well! It makes my skin feel nice and smooth too! It's also great for getting makeup stains off your counter/sink! ,0
I adore this fragrance. It is the only one my husband likes and he loves it too. It is so clean smelling and just fresh. I put it on every night and even spray some inside the pillowcases. I hope it is around as long as I am alive.,4
"I adore this lip balm... there is nothing nicer after you've spent time pampering your skin at home to top it off with a really soothing lip balm. Goes on like a gloss, rich to feel, and does wonders for your lips. I get chapped lips ANY time of year, and since I have very full lips, that isn't a good thing! This helps me keep on top of the dryness that I am prone too. ",1
"I adore this lipstick. I wanted a lipstick that did not leave my lips feeling dry and caked with makeup, and this is the answer! This lipstick goes on smooth, and makes me lips feel soft. Though Sephora does not have this particular shade, I purchased Rose Scenario. If you can find it at your department store Dior counter, TRY IT ON! It is the most amazing, natural pink color I've ever found! I got both my sister and my mother hooked on it. If you have light to medium skin, and are looking for a lipstick that is the same color as your lips, only BETTER, you have to go try Rose Scenario. It's truly amazing. ",0
"I adore this product. I have frizzy/wavey hair which is quite unmanageable. With the help of the glossing cream , Fekkai's shampoo and conditioner and a diffusing blowdryer, I can create a beautiful, healthy head of curls! ",3
"I adpre this toner ! It sets up my face just perfect for moisturizer and make up without drying out my extra sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin, it is the non-drying toner I have ever tried, I keep 3 bottles on hand at time. ! ",3
"i agree that this is best used on eyebrows to make the pencil/shadow last longer. i use a bit over my lower lashline powder liner and it stays all day. on my upper lid, it feels too hard. i use She Laq to keep loose pigments and glitter in place. ",2
"I agree with all the other reviews, i have 2 of these shadow/liners and am buying more. They are non irritating, super blendable alone or together and make great liners as well as shadows. The Benefit shadow/liner brush works fantastic for application but in a hurry you can also apply with a finger for shadow and it will still look good. Stays true all day and can be layered. A LOT in each pot, keep them tightly closed so they dont dry out. ",3
"I agree with former reviews -- it does not matter how far away from your face you hold the bottle, it will absolutly douse your face (I mean liquid beading on your face) after one spray. Rather than setting my makeup, it rmoved my makeup when I had to blot my face after use. Returned this item. ",1
I agree with some of the other reviewers that it does have an odd scent. Not altogether unpleasant but very odd. I love to dot a couple of dots of this on and then smudge it on with my finger. It also looks very cool over a red lipstain. ,1
"I agree with the other 1-star rater. It made my face redder and made me break-out. I don't really like the cleanser because it doesn't ""melt away makeup"" like it says. I tend to use another foam cleanser right after. ",0
"I agree with the other reviewer about this curler. I loved that it is compact, curled beautifully (thanks to its curved not a flat rubber pad) and is MUCH easier to use and less pinching than the traditional metal curlers. But when my second one broke after only a few months of use (as the first one had), I gave up and went back to my old metal one. I was hoping the first one was just defective, but unfortunately the real issue is in the design. The plastic ""arms"" that attach the lever onto the curler are just too fragile. Come on Sephora - find a solution to that and you'll outsell all of the other eyelash curlers on the market!! ",3
"I almost bought this at full price, and I'm glad I didn't. It's not even worth the sale price. The color is pretty (the one I bought is blue/white), but the cream shadow creased terribly even with UDPP as a primer, and the glitter fallout was a mess. ",1
"i already have full lips so that was probably my first mistake in purchasing this product. i was simply looking for the the top lip dip and this product juss doesnt cut it. I love the fact that it gives a step by step process of ""how to apply"" for women that are first learning makeup tricks... i still use it to justify the 25+ price tag but ",0
i also found the brush to either dispense too much product or not enough .. i do like the texture & the coverage on my lids. this is my first eye primer experience. i think it could be a lbit more creamy. ,4
I also have rosacea and this has made a HUGE difference in my ruddiness. My 56 year-old skin looks smoother and almost glows. An unexpected bonus is diminished pore size! And it doesn't smell bad to me. The only downside is the price :( ,4
"I always am looking for little ways to keep skincare and make up simple. Multi-taskers like this one is exactly what I'm after. I have other primers that are great, but if I want to, I can skip my morning moisturizer and use this to prime and protect. I love having options like that. This primer feels like a moisturizer more than other primers do, but it's very light, so I can use a weightless foundation and not notice feeling either product on my face at all. Like it! ",3
"I always buy this for my son for Christmas and his birthday. It is his favorite scent and his new wife loves it on him. I am sure I will continue to buy it and would recommend it, if you need a special gift.",4
I always get compliments when I wesr this fragrance. It is a classic sent that just smells feminine. I wear the leg shine also. I bought the roll on perfumes for my purse. It is my new signature sent. Thanks~,2
"I always go back to Bad Gal Lash in Black, not just because of the name, or the packaging although those are both great too. Seriously though it defines lashes nicely and gives a great dramatic volume effect.",0
"I always had terrible cuticles before I started using this. It's great to have a choice of formulas. I love the delivery system, the texture of the product and the pleasant smell and feel of it on my fingers. I gave it one less star because I wish it would last longer, but that might be just becaust I use it often 'cause it's just so cool! ",3
I always have trouble finding a mascara that I truly like. This was a fantastic way to pick something without wasting a lot of money on 1 that I may or may not like. Each mascara is different and I have found 1 that I really like but I will keep testing them out until I have tried them all. This is a great product!!! ,3
"I always love the color combos in a BE set. This is really cool, but not something I could wear every day. This would basically only be used for me when going out, which is not often. But, the brush that comes with this set is the best eyeliner brush I have gotten from BE. I love it. ",1
I always struggled with finding the right color of blush that looks natural especially buying products over the internet. I read about Nars in Allure and decided to give it a try. It looks great with or without a tan. This one is a keeper.,3
"I always use Mineral Veil over my make-up and have been carrying a a retractable brush dusted with Mineral Veil in my purse. Having this portable, filled brush insures that I won't run out of this terrific product when I'm on the go and need a touch-up. ",4
"I always use this and keep and extra on hand. If Ii am using a waterproof mascara I never worry because I buy Sephora's whole line of skincare products, even their nail care products. I just use some Mascara remover on a cotton round and the mascara is off in a second, and no stinging eyes. Sephora's whole line of skincare is inexpensive and does what it says it will do. I will not use any thing else of let myself get under 2 bottles of everything at a time. ",3
"I always wanted to know how to do Smokey Eyes. This was my first kit and I've had so much fun playing around. There is a little instruction card with suggestions for color combinations and placement. I found this really helpful in the beginning before I got brave enough to branch out and experiment. The one drawback is that if you don't tap the excess powder off your brush enough, you end up with a dark dusting of powder on your face, but it usually cleans up fairly easily with a cotton swab. ",4
"I always wanted to try this product and what a special way to do it. You get a DVD, the brushes, and all the essential basics to get you started in an affordable package. I got one for each of daughters and they are hooked too. We all look Marvelous now!!! ",3
I always wear waterproof mascara and this eye make up remover works great. I wet a q-tip (pinch out excsss water) then dip it in the make up remover and gently use the q-tip to rub it over my eyelashes. Then I use a wash cloth to fully wipe away any extra mascara . I was using another brand before the Sephora brand and and it worked just as good but it was more than double the price. Be Sure to ALWAYS shake well before using. ,3
"I am 48 and still have very oily skin (sorry all you girls who've been told you will grow out of it!) that is prone to blackheads and the occasional pimple. Since I started using Steep Clean Cleansing Milk, I have not had any pimples at all, and have far fewer blackheads. It doesn't seem to have any effect on how oily my skin is (see my reviews on Medi-Matte, that works for me) but it is the only product that ever worked as a pimple-preventive for me. ",3
"I am 49 with thick, wavy, colored hair. This stuff works very much like the salon version. My hair has such shine and is calmed and straighter. Did not need any leave in conditioner or gloss. I will use this once or twice a week with my other Fekkai products. ",3
"I AM 55, WORK OUTSIDE, OWN A BUSINESS AND HAD TERRIBLY WRINKLED SKIN. I STARTED USING STRIVECTIN TWICE A DAY 2 MONTHS AGO. I HAVE LOST ABOUT 50% OF MY WRINKLES. THE TUBE LASTS A LONG TIME TOO. THIS IS A MUST HAVE IF YOU HAVE DEEP WRINKLES! ",4
"I am 58 years old and harldly ever use any foundation. It felt heavy on my face and I would break out. I saw this product in the Sephora store and decided I would give it a try. WOW !!! I won't leave home without it now. I feel naked if I don't put it on, and we woudn't want that. THANK YOU....... ",4
I am 58 years old and have tried plenty of products over the years that have disappointed. This product (and the Caudalie Vino system) have done more for my skin in the past year than any other products before. My age spots are noticeably lighter and my skin is smoother than ever.,4
"I am 60 years young, and had good skin before Clarisonic - I am usually thought to be in my 40's. Clarisonic has made my skin nearly perfect - reduced large pores on my T-zone and gave me a glow. I have had better results with the Clarisonic than with salon facials! I'm hooked. Be aware, however, that because it works so well, products with retinol will have a stronger effect and you may experience redness, peeling and dryness where you use the product. I did. I just switched to the ""delicate"" brush head and cut back on the over the counter retinol product and my skin was fine. It takes about 2 weeks to see maximum results if you already have good skin, but I'm sure the results will be more dramatic for others. I don't like the Clarisonic cleanser that came with it, and just use my regular ones. ",4
"I am 60 years young, but my eyebrows had started to thin. I had tried Talika and it didn't work, so I gave Anastasia a try. I'm hooked - it took about 4 weeks to see results, but regular, consistent use has given me healthier, more lush brows. Don't expect overnight results - hair takes time to grow. But it does work! ",4
I am 65 years old and this hand treatment makes my hands look and feel younger. I put this on every night before I go to bed and my hands feel like silk when I wake up. It is absorbed easily by the skin and does not leave a sticky feeling on your skin. It is truly an incredible product. I cannot stand to be without it. ,4
"I am a 63 yr old woman and I have been using Absolue Makeup for about 5 years. I constantly get comments on how my face looks so soft, moist, fresh--most people comment on my very youthful ""glow"". I have used other cream foundations and none of them can touch Absolue ",4
I am a bareMinerals fanatic and this little jar is wonderful for BE face color that comes in the tiny pots as either samples or part of a kit and the lids are not big enough to swirl a face brush in. I simply transfer them to one of these jars and peel off the BE label and put it on the bottom of the jar. Fantastic! ,4
"I am about to purchase my 2nd bottle of this. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! I used to have problems with getting even coverage from foundation that LASTS because I use a pretty heavy duty moisturizer. This keeps my foundation looking FLAWLESS all day. I can put it on at 6am, come home and do minor touch ups, go right back out and be good for the entire night. A must have.",1
I am a bundle of energy and this scent makes me just relax!! I love it! I have convinced my s/o this is a room freshner. lol. I love the way my house smells when I get home-not overpowering at all. I just wish there were more products with this scent! ,2
"I am addicted to chapstick because my lips dry out easily, so I was a little hesitant to try wearing a lipstick since they can be a little drying. This was not the case with this lipstick! It is very creamy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous!",0
"I am a DKNY NY girl. This fragrenmce has all the same essences of the onle I love but is better! That Fresh clean yummy smell stays with you all day. Then when you think it's gone, Wahla, you smell it again... I love this Hespirides... ",3
I am a dry lip freak... this is wonderful! It takes off a little of the old dry skin and then you moisturize... how awesome! I have my daughter using it and I think this is going to be handed out to my girlfriends for Christmas! A MUST HAVE! ,3
"i am a huge fan of liquid liner! and when i tried this one at the store i fell in love! i ditched my old liquid liners for this queen liner instantly. the long handle makes it easy the move around the small corners of your eye, and the brush is very thin making it easy to make the lines straighter",0
"I am a huge fan of this eyeliner and have it in almost every color. It glides easily on the eye and wears all day long. I also wear Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes waterproof liner, and I think that the two products are interchangeable except this one is cheaper. I especially love it in Flashy Copper. ",0
"I am a HUGE mascara fanatic and also a Benefit devotee so I was excited about this mascara initially when it came out. However, because the brush is bent when you pull it out of the tube mascara tends to glob at the base of the brush making for a messy application. If you like the idea of a bent brush you can really do it to any mascara. I ended up straightening out the brush anyway because this one was so globby and still it wasn't a phenomenal mascara... definitely not worth the time. It's no BADgal. ",0
"I am a lip balm freak. I have lip balms everywhere (purse, office, every room of the house...) and this is the best lip balm I've tried in years. It goes on so smooth, smells great, and it lasts as long time too. It has a slight tingling sensation but not harsh like some other balms or glosses. This is my new A+ favorite! ",2
"I am a lip gloss fan, even though I am 45 yrs old, I cannot help it...I love the shine and sparkle. Out of all the ones I have tried, and all the $$ I have spent, this gloss is worth every cent! I am hooked. I want more colors now. Have only tried 2. Go out in the sun and it's beautiful on your lips. All I can say is thank you! ",3
"I am almost finished with my second jar. I use this nightly over a retinol treatment. It leaves my skin dewy. I tried lots of ""natural"" products, and often found them to either not work or have alcohol in them. This one works well and no alcohol. ",2
"I am a long time fan of Philosophy Pure Grace products. I have used shaving gels before,none of them have worked as well as this one. I use it daily and get an incredibly close shave. I have sensitive skin and have had no irration with this product. The Amazing Grace frgrance is very light in this gel. ",3
I am a long time lover of gel brow color. The one I used has been discontinued so i tried this and ordered taupe. I used it twice then threw it away. It is difficult to apply evenly and is an un-natural color!,4
"I am always a little hesitant buying makeup kits online that do not have any color variation. But, this one has really been one of the best purchases I have made! I love the Photofinish primer, I just use it on my eyes with a little powder and it sets my eyeshadow for the whole day! The creme eyeliner does not crease or smear. It is the first cream eyeliner that does not leave my lash line in the first five minutes of wear. The soft lights is a great highlighter that instantly takes away the bags under my eyes in the morning and it give a great shimmer to the cheek bone. The eyeshadow trio is great because the colors exactly mimic the ""less is more"" trend for this fall. Paired with a bold lipstick, you will look chic and fabulous for work, play or anything in between! ",0
I am a make-up artis and an Aestheticiant and I absolutely love this primer! Shadow stays on ALL day with no creasing. Be sure to tap it onto the eyelids as opposed to rubbing it in. You will get better coverage that way. This should be in everyone's make up bag!! ,2
I am a makeup artist and this is great for my makeup kit. They stay on my clients really well and I not only use them as liner but I use it all the lid. I use this personally as well and think its a great a buy for anyone that wants to experiment. ,1
"I am a make-up junkie, and have tried them all. I really love this blush because you get instant color and don't have to layer it on to see it! One quick sweep, and instant jolt of color. I don't have a lot of time in the morning, and this helps speed the process along. Best blush I've used ever!",3
"I am a massage therapist. I have to keep my nails short: I cut them with a nail cilpper, and then need them to be absolutely smooth before I give a massage. This glass nail file is the best thing I've found to give an absolutely smooth finish to my nails.....I couldn't live without one! ",4
"I am an admitted product junkie and heard great things about this line. I received a sample of the night gel and was impressed enough to buy this combo kit. Love it, love it. My skin is fresher overall, age spots have lightened and the sheer transformation creme leaves a dewey finish on the skin. I bought the same kit for my sister. Verdict = she loves it and uses it daily.",2
"I am an admittidly mascara freak ! I try just about every new one that comes out. I love this one ! It's got everything a girl could want in a mascara. I have this lashes. This goes on smoothly, building volume, lengthening, curls and is good for my lashes. Also smudgeproof and very buildable....",3
"I am an African-American with fine (sometimes curly) hair. I had been looking for a conditioner to keep my hair healthy. Based on the reviews, I ordered this product and I am totally in love. Sometimes I put my hair in a ponytail and let it dry with the conditioner on it. This is a must-have as I do not plan on being without it! ",2
"i am a new user to this product, and i absolutely adore it. it tingles when you apply it and it is very refreshing and eye-opening (i am a groggy morning person). my skin is very sensitive and i break out easily, so i've always used proactiv toner but this will now forever be my go-to. i bought the small bottle to try it out, and think it would be the perfect stocking stuffer for my girlfriends.",1
"I am an ICU nurse and need to wear light fragrances. Usually light fragrances don't last and are boring. Issey Miyake fixed this with L'Eau d'Issey Summer-it is simply beautiful-I get compliments ALL of the time from even patients that are not feeling well. His other fragrances are highly recommended, too. You will not be disappointed!!! ",4
I am a product junkie and this one definitely is a good buy. Exspenzive but worth the purchase if you tend to have dry skin. It will leave behind a nice sheen after you step out of the shower since it has oil mixed in with the scrub. It smells like lemon candy.,1
"I am a real fan of PerriconeMD ceramic skin smoother. Since I have been using it the fine lines and wrinkles around my lips have decreased significantly and my skin looks smoother and feels softer. It also lets my makeup (when I wear it) go on effortlessly. For the first time in my life I am not wearing makeup every day, but I definitely wear this skin smoother daily. ",4
I am a self proclaimed makeup snob. But in the past few yrs I've been using store brand lipstick because with all the high end brands i never saw a huge diffrent. Well I've been in search for the perfect lip stick for a smoky eye well i couldn't it so i tried Honolulu Honey and let me tell you I'm more then impressed in all 18 yrs of waring makeup This lipstick is amazing it is full of color very moisturizing and long waring I want one in every color,1
"I am a total makeup junkie and have tried just about every mascara there is. This is one of the best ones out there. I will say that the formula does dry out a little faster than some others from less expensive companies, but the level of definition and volume definicils gives is totally worth it. The stiff brush is great for taming long curly lashes, but small enough to reach short lashes too. As with all lancome products, the level of pigment is more than sufficient. If stranded on a desert island, this is the one product I'd take with me.",1
"I am big on exfoliation, use the Clarisonic, etc, so I really didn't expect a lot with this cloth. But, wow! My skin was incredibly smoother after using it. The look and feel was of polished, flawless skin. There was no redness or irritation at all, and it works on the body too. Since the cloth has no roughness , it feels as though nothing is happening while using it. Worth a try! ",4
"I am blonde and my lashes are too! WOW, this mascara is not only the best and defining and lengthing, it is the cleanest and easiest to take off. And on raccoon eyes, ever! i recommend this to everyone! ",3
I am currently using the brightening anti-perspirant. It's still too early to tell whether or not it's been effective. I can tell you though that this product does not dry as quickly as advertised. Once rolled on I usually have to wait a couple minutes before putting a shirt on. Not an ideal situation when i'm running late. Also since it's scent-less i'm not sure if I feel protected from odor or wetness.,1
"I am currently using this mascara now. It's not the best mascara I've ever used, but it is definitely quality. I prefer that my lashes look super thick and long from my mascara, and this does thicken and lengthen, but not as much as I'd like. If I were to recommend a mascara, you should try the Lancome brand, this is a notch better than the Tarte.",0
I am disappointed with the cuticle oil...which is more like a cream. I have a hard time controlling the amount of product coming out from the tube and notice no special results from using it. I'm going back to putting 100% shea butter on my cuticles. ,4
"I am due in 4 weeks and started developing the dreaded pregnancy mask about a month ago. I ordered this product and have been using it for 2 weeks. The ""mask"" is almost gone. This is totally worth the money!!",1
"I am fair, and when i have no mascara on, my eyelashes are white and non existant. this wears like mascara, doesn't flake and only comes of with oil based cleansers. it looks so natural and makes my lashes defined, long and separated. this is one of those, must haves. finally!!!!!!!!! ",1
"I am fair skinned and use the natural color. I love the easy application and the no mess for traveling. I also use bare escentuals, but this is beginning to become my favorite. The replacement sponges are also great, but a little difficult to replace. I replace mine every month. ",1
"I am fifty something and have been using eye cream since my college days. I have pretty much tried every eye cream out there. Got this as a sample and absolutely love it! It is rich and emollient yet absorbs into the skin unlike so many other creams and it has made remarkable improvement in my dark circles, Very reasonable priced too. I am so happy to have found this little miracle. Thanks Sephora! ",3
"I am getting older and I have a few wrinkles, OH NO! anyway i have had a problem with foundation or powders clinging in the creavices. This does not do this for me. It dries the oily spots and soothes the dry spots! I LOVE IT!",4
I am hooked! I can't seem to take a shower without it!!! My skin has never looked better. I really don't need lotion after showering with this product because my skin is left so hydrated and clean. I also love the scent!,2
"I am horribly cursed when it comes to painting my own nails. With Sephora's Nail Patches it's easy for me to look like I just step out of a nail shop after a fabulous manicure. I can also be pretty rough on my nails, but the Nail Patches still stay put for a couple of weeks. I love this product! ",1
"I am in love with this adorable makeup box filled with so many fantastic makeup goodies. The vain looking glam doll figurine is so cute with the reflective mirror. Don't expect her to twirl perfectly - she sort of bounces around. But that does not take away from this collection, The only thing that could be improved in this collection would be some brushes, especially for the lipgloss. Actually, it would be nice if the lipgloss in particular were portable. All in all, for $34 you get a heck of a lot! ",3
"I am in love with this bronzer. It might be a little dark for pale girls, but being olive skinned, it is the perfect color for me. Subtle shimmer highlights the cheekbones and a beautiful tan color gives a golden goddess look. Great for day or night! ",0
"I am in my 50's, have very oily skin and live in humid sw fla - this is the only foundation that stays on and looks great all day. It also fills in the little lines and keeps my eye makeup from melting. I have thrown out all my other foundations. ",4
I am in my late 30's and have monthly break-outs. I have been using this product for 3 months and have seen my breakouts almost completely elimnated. For the fist time in years I can wear little or no make-up because my skin is just that clemish free. ,2
"I am mostly a matte shadow person or none at all. These surprised me even though they shimmer they really look good. You can use them heavily or lightly, mix them and layer them. The brushes are the best I've ever used aside from sponges and my fingers. ",3
"I am not a fan of lavender smells, but I found that this lavender really grew on me. It has a very refreshing, effervescent quality in my bath water -- a little hard to describe, but very fun and very fresh. I'm also absolutely crazy about the pomegranate bubbly. It's a very sweet, tart, and sparkling fragrance that I can't get enough of. Each of these bottles lasted me a long time. A little capful in the bath was enough to fill my whole bathroom with delicious, fruity aroma. Best about the set is the very festive bottle design. It gives a very New Year/celebratory feel. Overall, it makes me feel very happy and festive. ",0
I am not a fan of liquid foundation at all and found this to be one of the best mineral powder foundations that I've tried - especially for the price! The double sided sponge really does make a difference (you choose a side for light or full coverage). The coverage lasts all day too. ,1
"I am not a fan of Nars blush. At first I thought it was just the shade, so I bought a 2nd one. I don't like the coverage, no matter what I used. I went from powder brush to fan brush to yes, a sponge - it goes on extremely heavy and appears to sit on my skin rather than blend. I didn't find it to be translucent or natural!",1
I am not a fragrance perrson because I am sensitive. But this is the perfect product for someone who is looking for double duty. Leaves a light frangrance that is clean and fresh and leaves skin soft and supple not greasy. I use the entire line of bath products.,3
I am NOT a Philosophy fan -- BUT this is absolutely scrumptious. The smell is not overpowering and it leaves the bath water smooth and silky but not oily. It makes a full and lasting tub of bubbles. You'll love it!! ,3
"I am not a powder, concealer, or heavy make up person. Just a few months before 40 and showing signs of aging I decided to add to my daily routine. This is not your mothers finishing powder, in fact, you can't see it on, or even feel it on, but some how it blends and evens out all of those fine lines and color spots. I use it over my HD foundation for those dressier events, and alone - yes alone - for every day! This and my moisturizer are great together. I don't understand how it works or why - but you have to try it to believe it! I love this stuff!! ",2
"I am not in love with this lipstick. It tends to leave my lips very dry and has ""black"" specks throughout the lipstick which I find very disconcerting. The cost of almost $30 leaves me wondering what is really worth that much in this product. The color is not what I expected either, being more brown/red than red/brown. ",4
I am not really a lip liner wearer but since it is BE I thought I'd give it a try since I love most of the BE products. The neutral is the one that I liked the best because the line wasn't to hard or noticeable. I just didn't really like the lip liners as much. ,1
I am not sure how or why it works but it does. My skin is less oily and more normalized now. This has also minimized my breakouts... I use it at night and it only requires 3 drops but I won't be without it. It lasts a long time - I am on my same bottle after 3 months. Well worth the cost. ,3
"I amnot usually ever a fan of CK scents, but this one got me. I sprayed one squirt on my wrist at a store and couldn't stop smelling my wrist all night! I bought it the next day. Its a sophisticated scent, and calms to a very pleasing fragrance! ",0
"I am now seriously in love with Korres lip glosses. No other natural lip gloss smells/ tastes this good! This color is GORGEOUS; however, I am into more muted tones right now so I won't use this a lot. Instead, I'll just buy more of the lighter color Korres glosses. The ""love your lips"" collection is fantastic!!! ",3
I am obsessed with the Amazing Grace line. I am not one for strong scents but this is light and beautiful and the roll on gives me just enough and exactly where I want it. I have made this my signature scent. ,1
"I am OBSESSED with this blush. I started out by using O*gasm because of the amazing reviews but I've switched to Torrid. It looks super pink but gives my asian skin an amazing, just ran a mile look. Nars is great because they have tons of pigment and use really high quality ingredients. I love it!",1
"I am often asked what are my absolute favorite products & NARS All About Eve is my favorite eye shadow combination- ever! The natural looking beige shadows work well on everyone I work with by making up the eyes naturally and beautifully, without looking like a ton of eye makeup, not too frosty, not too matte! I use one shade on the lid & the other all over the orbital bone., and sometimes wet them for a nice pearly effect on the lid to open up the eyes! AAE...Just perfect & worth every penny! ",3
"I am oh so in love! This 2"" styler allows me to turn my insanely thick hair into gorgeous waves, curls, & very straight w/ a little flip under. Please remember to section off hair, then use the styler ... just as when you blowout your hair. Perfect every time! ",1
"I am old and yes I have those naughty lines BUT NO MORE because IT helps hide them. Especially around the lips. Have just a little spot you want to hide? IT will do it. Thank you Benefit ""IT's"" Prefect ",3
"I am on about my 4th bottle of this. I use it every night with a cotton pad to remove makeup all over my face. I often have to use something different for tough eye makeup, but this works for everything else and is soothing and non-irritating. It leaves no residue either. Generally I use this to get the makeup off and then use a creamy cleanser on my dry skin to finish getting cleansed for the night. I also use this to refresh during summertime - if I get really sweaty and just need to perk up a bit. ",3
"I am one of those crazy women who has dozens of half empty bottles of body lotion, but this one is an enduring favorite and a must have for me. The level of moisture is perfect, rich without being at all greasy and it lasts all day. I also adore the fragrance, which is a bright natural smelling citrus scent.",1
"I am one of your older customers (56 years). I love the Nars Blush because it gives me natural color without giving me the ""clown look"" that you see on too many women. It is a great color for those of us who are losing that natural glow.",4
"I am over 50 and have very dry skin, and have tried many different body creams, but this is truly the best of the best. Mild fragrance, infused with shea butter, very emollient and creamy, a real treat for your skin! ",4
"I am pleasantly surprised by this foundation. I wouldn't characterize the coverage as medium-full. On me, it's more like light-medium. What it does beautifully is make your complexion look even - more perfected. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not find it to appear cakey. Best foundation I've used. ",2
"I am pleasantly surprised that such a creamy lipstick would last as long as these do. Even though I am a brunette, I have trouble wearing red lipsticks. The ""Rouge D' Enfer"" works perfectly for me as a deep rich red, perfect for evening. ""Catfight"" is similar enough to my natural lip colour and great for everyday. Had to take off 1 star for small amount of product for the price. But, oh well! When you find the right red, it's like finding gold.",4
"I am pleasantly surprised with this product. I didn't think it would be all that great (sorry Sephora), but because it had a $5 price tag I just thought, ""why not?"" So anyways, I got this in 115 which is a really nice neutral color. It is super creamy so it glides on perfectly, making it super easy to apply and it lasts and lasts on me. Plus, it looks soooooo good on me. The color really is very close to my lip color. It is just a bit darker so it is really the perfect liner for all the glosses I wear. Highly recommended product. ",1
"I am really liking Too Faced shadows. I use them with Too Faced's Primer potion and they seem to last a good time. I have Label Who, Glamazon, Socialite and Dirt Bag which all work great with a medium skin tone. ",2
"I am so glad I bought this fragrance. Everyone seems to love it! It lasts all day too. It blends each scent flawlessly for a sensual, beautiful and romantic scent. Plus the bottle is so pretty! Wear this perfume and feel confident and gorgeous! :) ",0
I am so glad that Laura recognized the needs of those of us with fair skin. I use to take the original Balance-n-Brighten and dig out some of the darker streaks just to accomodate my fair skin tone...I loved it that much!! Balance-n-Brighten is the best touch up powder or stand-alone foundation that I have ever tried. So thankful for this FAIR version. ,3
I am so glad the lipstick is back. I used my old one to the very last bit. I like to use the rip stick as a high lighter and the powder on top of it for an nice shine at night. The gold powder is fun as an high lighter on the brow bone. This is a keeper. I think will order two. Teh lip stick is glossy and has a nice shen to it. . Put it on top of red for a night look. ,4
I am so happy with my train case! Everything fits beautifully! & it's pink!! I can't wait to purchase another one. I have increased my makeup collection & I can't wait to pick out another case(maybe the croc one)! ,2
"I am sold on Mineral Veil. This product gives your makeup a flawless, finished look. It seems to hide those flaws that just makeup alone cannot. It helps keep my makeup set longer which is especially good during hot humid weather.",4
"I am sold on Too Faced Shadow Insurance! Absolutely no creases at the end of the day. I think if I'd forget to put it on, I might just wash off the shadow and start over again! The smallest dab is sufficient.",3
"I am sorry, but for all the hype on this line of products, I thought I would try it. I am NOT impressed. The shadows crease almost right away and you can barely see the color, no matter how much you apply. Total waste of money! ",2
"I am so sensitive to many good perfumes. When I used the sample of Rock & Roses, I was amazed. It not only didnt bother my allergies, But my husband of 30 years commented on how nice it was!!!!!! He never comments on any perfume I wear. hank you Sephora. ",4
I am so thrilled that I was told about this makeup. It is absolutely the best that I have ever tried. I feel that I look younger since it does not soak into my skin and clog my pores. It stays on all day and is just amazing. Please try it and you will never try another makeup again. ,2
"I am starting to fall deeply in love with the Korres line. It all started with the ""Love Your Lips"" kit. (Buy it! Buy it!) This was my first foray into their eye makeup. I am very impressed. I got the gray color. It's soft and goes on nicely. It lasted all day. And it's natural. What's not to love? ",3
I am still using the product but it really hasn't done much for the vertical lines around the lip area. I have tried many products for vertical lines around the lip area and very few have been impressive. I would love to know of one that really comes through! ,4
"I am such a devoted OPI customer, I even searched all walmart and target to look for it, then I came across to Sephora's new OPI nail polish line! True it's $9 but they have fantastic colors that you can't find elsewhere. Yesterday I managed to go in the actual store to check out the colors. I highly recommend to do that prior purchases. The colors are MUCH different in person!! They are gorgeous though! I purchased ""On stage"" and ""metro chic"" I took their last ones. Lucky me. But overall I am very satisfied with OPI's performance and am not surprise that only Sephora carries them. Good taste. You get what you paid for!! Those cheap nailpolish not only makes you nails turn gray after wearing them for a while they also chip easily. Invest on one of THESE, pay the price and you'll get great results :) ",0
"I am thrilled to find this product! I am a mascara junkie and a lover of all things natural but finally, I think I can stop trying every single mascara. This is great and NATURAL. I HAVE to curl my eyelashes or they're stick straight. Korres mascara really holds the curl! And, it's not heinously expensive. I highly recommend it! ",3
"I am thrilled with Sephora Professionel brushes. This is a great eyeshadow brush, not too big but big enough to hold enough product to cover your whole eyelid. Very soft bristles too. Really like this a lot. ",2
"I am totally cosmetically challenged-so this was right up my alley! All the tools plus a handy lesson in one little box. It really did help me brighten up my eyes and gave me a subtle but fresh look. My only complaint is the brushes are a little small which makes handling them a little tricky. Overall, a great little kit. ",3
"I am truly in love with this foundation. It is so light and natural. My skin looks and feels younger than it has in years. So easy to apply, feels like nothing on your skin and covers any flaws. I get so many compliments on my skin. ",3
"I am trying to use more natural products, so I gave this moisturizer a try. It is extremely lightweight, a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly. I have pretty normal skin, but I felt like I had to apply the moisturizer twice because I always felt dry after the first application. Also, my makeup did not seem to apply as smoothly as with my regular moisturizer. This moisturizer might work really well for people with oily skin. ",1
"I am used to use exploration cleanser for my face.\nI liked it.\nBut one of my freind told me that FRESH is nicer than that.\nUImbrian clay face treatment helps my face skin to keep clean and give hydration.\nAlso, my face skin is used to turn red and get pimple during examination or when i get stress.\nThis product helps me to keep my face skin as normal.",1
"I am very happy that it actually works. I put it on this morning at 8:45 am and it is now 9:11 pm and my eyeshadow looks as if I just applied. No crease, no lines, no anything. I even cried today and used tissue to blot my face, but the eyeshadow was resistant. I have been sold. I will be a faithful buyer! ",2
"I am very picky and eclectic when it comes to fragrances... I have bought and become bored of coco chanel, juicy, flowerbomb, and cashmere mist to name a few. Voile de fleur is the first one that has held my attention. Its a little too heavy for day, especially in the summer, but at night its the perfect rich and sexy accent for going out! i love it. ",0
I am very pleased with the results of this product. Simple to use and application is easy. Packaged nicely. Light lines disapear within weeks. Recently at family gathering and could see the difference between me and younger siblings. I have no lines to speak of and they had the lines around mouth and eyes. I felt pretty good about myself that day. I will continue using this product in conjunction with vitamin C cream from Korres. ,3
I am VERY pleased with this kit the brushes are great the color are fabulous the clutch makes for a nice makeup bag so ladies if you want a great kit for a bargin price this is it really I can't say enough about this kit and also for a bit of added drama try mixing the eye colors with the silver extreme glimmer from the extreme glimmers kit mix with the vintage ruby wet it is VREY PRETTY ,0
"I apply my make up at 6:30 every morning, by the time I get off work at 3, my eyeshadow is gone or has fallen. With Shadow Insurance, my eyeshadow looks the same when I leave my house as it does at 10 pm. I did not know this was possible. It is so easy to apply. I am a believer for life!",0
"I began wearing Opium when it was first introduced (hate to admit how long it's been). It's in the top two of my favorite fragrances (switches from #1 to #2 at my whim). I'll wear it for months, then tire of it for awhile. But I always go back to it. Opium forever! ",4
"i bought 22. it's the bright orange that i was looking for. it stays for the whole day, and it looks really cute on fair-light skin. it's a bit powdery, so the case becomes little messy, but doesn't bother me too much. i think i will use it for quite a while, it looks like it doesn't wear out. and i will purchase the item again, i'm surely in love with it, and very satisfied. ",0
i bought 3 different kits and THOUGHT that each applique in each box was a combination of the 3 colors noted on the outside of the box. I WAS WRONG. i was disappointed in the multi color appliques in each kit. only a couple from each kit worked ok for me. a lot of money for only 2 applications for each kit. am returning 2 of the kits for a refund. a little messy and a little difficult to apply but worth trying. ,4
"I bought 6 of these for the office girls and I love them! The recipe box is much nicer than the picture and each of the bottles smells wonderful There's also a great recipe inside! Would make a great ""Secret-Santa"" gift, babysitter gift, or co-worker gift! ",3
"I bought an Amazing Grace set which contained the perfume, lotion, bath, shampoo and shower gel. The first time I used it I wished I had bought the bigger bottles. It is truly ""amazing"" and it's the only thing I ever want to smell like!",2
"I bought Envy Me for Fall because I'm not into lipstick & really could not be happier! It looks dark but is actually very sheer & pretty or you can layer it on a little thicker & not only will it look darker but maker your lips look thicker & so luscious! The dazzling shine really is almost blinding, especially in sunlight but the only problem is that you have to keep your mouth frozen because the second yoy rub your lips together (which you will def. want to do it feels SOOO good) the shine is gone & you will need to retouch. Luckily the tube is generously sized so I can go ahead & decadantly do this without feeling guilty! Tastes & smells great too! ",1
"I bought GlowFusion Active Bronzer in the color ""Golden"" and it is absolutely beautiful. It is not too dark to wear in the wintertime because it just gives a glow to the skin instead of a tanned look. The powder is silky soft and blends very easily. I've tried zillions of bronzers and this is the first one that I've felt that I can wear in the winter and not look too dark. Great bronzer! ",2
"I bought Granite, which is the perfect shade for my dark brown eyebrows. I love this because it adds just enough color and keeps the hairs in place. It's much easier to control the color and coverage than with a pencil. I love not having to mess with a separate brush or pencil sharpener.",1
"I bought it in Ghetto Girl and clear, and it's just fantastic...it's a great pick-up when my lipstick starts to fade, and it stays on for a long time giving great shine and protection! Tastes yummy too! ",1
"I bought it to wear over my regular foundation and it just makes my skin look pasty and deathlike =P I heard from many people that it works well even as a powder without the whole set, but maybe it would work better as a part of the bare-escentuals set.",4
I bought my first shu uemura eye lash curler at the famous Sephora store in Paris in 2000. This is one of the best tools for make-up -- everything you read is true -- there really is no comparison. It makes your lashes curl like no other. A must-have. ,2
I bought my sister a set similar to this for Christmas this past year. She is a dance major so she performs a ton and she said that she loves the longevity of this make up. She also has problem skin and said that she has no extra problems using this make up like she has in the past with other brands. This is a great value and a good gift for the ultimate girlie-girl! ,0
"I bought Nars lipstick in Belle de Jour a few months ago, and it's one of my favorite lipsticks. The color is really pretty, but also, the consistency of the lipstick is wonderful. It doesn't dry your lips out after wearing it for a few hours and it's long lasting. The best moisturizing lipstick I own. Plus, there are a lot of colors to choose from within the range - the colors compliment a variety of skin tones.",1
"i bought Nars ""Orgasm"" because of all the hype surrounding it. it did not disappoint. Nars blushes are amazing. a little bit goes a long way and u don't have to reapply. i love these blushes. i will def continue to purchase more! i hate the price but i will buy more",1
"I bought one of these a while ago, and completely used up one of the pink colors. It went on very well (usually used just my finger), and was not sticky at all. I never used the darker color but once in the quartet, and would have liked to have purchased one of the pinks by itself. It wasn't very long-lasting, though. ",1
"I bought one of these for each of my grandaughters, ages 5 and 8. They loved them, especially since Sephora is their favorite store, They were thrilled with the clear mascara and all the goodies in the box. ",4
I bought Orgasm Nars Blush and its very light but last a long time. It provides a natural looking flushed look that is flattering to almost all skin tones. I will definetly buy this again. The only surprise? No blush brush included.,2
"I bought several sets for sister-in-laws as well as myself for Christmas. I think it will be a fun way to try out the different ""flavors"" as a way to kick up your morning or night. :-) And, the recipes on the box look yummy! ",4
"i bought She Laq to keep loose pigment shadows in place, as well as to keep glitter from falling off. it works great to keep the eyeliner on my lower lashline from smudging, but it does feel a bit like glue if you put too much. it's really great to keep eyebrowder powder in place all day. ",2
"I bought some of this after trying a small bit on my neck at the store. I can't remember the color but it was the next to lightest shade. The first time I tried it on my entire face I liked it. It felt good, looked good...until an hour later when I looked in the mirror and my face had turned ORANGE! The gold pigments in this foundation don't work for all skin types so I recommend you get a sample to try at home before you buy it. I took mine back and tried the lightest shade and had the same problem. ",3
"I bought Taos to compliment a red lipstick, and it is absolutely beautiful. The color is perfect, it lasts pretty much all day, and it felt very light on my face; like I didn't even have any blush on. NARS blush is AMAZING, and I will never buy another brand.",1
"I bought the blueberry flavor. I love blueberries but this tastes nothing like them. I've tried to drink it twice, but I just can't get the whole glass down. Sorry, it may be healthy but it tastes awful. I'll just drink lots of green tea instead. ",4
"I bought the color ""Maui"" and it is a good everyday matte blush color. This is a good choice if you have dry skin. It stays put but doesn't look cakey. I have also bought the ""Orgasm"" shade. It is more of a highlighter with the sparkles and light peachy shade, and looks great at night.",4
"I bought the color online, which is always risky, I love UD, so I went for it. The packaging is fun, cool, worth showing to friends & coworkers, The coverage is perfect, although I wish I stay put longer. The only gripe I have is the taste. Yuck! ",2
"I bought the earlier version of this kit and it changed the way I think about makeup. If you want more coverage try the kabuki brush for applying your bare minerals. If you have oily skin or large pores don't buff too much as it becomes too shiny. Don't give up! All of my friends who tried this had to have at least two tries before they got the hang of it. It will feel so light like you're not wering makeup so you might feel a little strange but keep trying and you'll see what everyone is talking about. If this is too dark you'll need to buy ""fair"". I mix fair with fairly light and love it! ",2
"I bought the glittering black , crystal, and taupe. I was pleased will all except the crystal. The crystal shade was like a light aqua and was very sheer. The other two worked well though and looked very pretty on my lids. ",0
I bought the grapefruit and it was a total waste of money. It feel really greasy on and smells like cheap kids makeup up..almost like a crayon. It doesnt hydrate the lips at all... Invest in something else! On a positive note..The packaging is soo cute. ,0
"I bought the head shot trio and loved the colors, I could create a natural look or go with a more dramatic one, the shadows blended perfectly. However, the pink shade just fell out of its slot after a few days, bummer! ",3
"I bought the light version and won't buy it again. It blends on well, but my T-zone starts to shine much more quicker than with any other primer and I keep touching up throughout the day. It is too rich for me or just not the right product.",3
"I bought the NARS blush in ""the pink color with the profane name"" in 2005 and I still have the same compact. I love that all you have to do is dab a little on the brush and you still have amazing coverage. The ""pink color with the profrane name"" is by far my favorite colors by NARS and it looks marvelous on everyone. By far one of my most essential makeup piece.",0
"I bought the Neutral color, and it is the perfect shade for me! I like the texture of this gloss -- it's thicker and doesn't feel like its gone 5 minutes after you apply it. It's got a nice minty fresh feeling too. ",3
"I bought the Peach Blossom scented Sephora Body Butter in a Sephora store. I liked the smell when I bought it but never sampled it on my skin... To me, it feels somewhat greasy and not moisturizing at all. The packaging goes on to say it's made up of natural shea butter, jojba and olive oils, etc which makes it sound wonderful, but looking over the ingredients list is an EYESORE!!!! Overall, the product smells yummy and enticing, but the feeling is somewhat sticky. ",0
I bought these in Crash and Radium for my teenage daughters and they love them! My 16 year old says it is the coolest eyeliner she's ever used and wants some in every color now! I think it looks pretty on and according to my daughters it stays put till they wash it off at night. ,3
"I bought these pencils in deviant (blue), covet (green), and lust (purple) and love every single one! They go on smoothly and come in great colors that are bright and fun, and they really do make a huge difference in lighting up your whole eye. They stay on all day, are easy to apply thickly or lightly, and are great to use for a smudged cat/smokey eye effect. Completely worth the money!",0
"I bought these to see how they'd work. They're interesting, but I don't quite have the hang of getting the makeup on both eyelids properly yet. It will definitely take some practice to get these to work for me. I like the idea though and will probably buy more if I can get the application down. ",3
"I bought the Shea Butter shampoo and conditioner and they were both worthless. My hair is not particularly dry, but it is curly.This conditioner smells great, but my hair was an unruly mess after using it. ",3
"I bought the smalll version of this at a Sephora store in Las Vegas. I LOVE the scent so much that I want the full size of G! I may be on the older side of the fence, but I still love cute things like these adorable Harajuku Lovers Scents! It gets really dark for a long time here in Barrow, so I need something happy to look at and smell on those long, dark days ",3
"I bought the Vanessa and I love how it smells and the color is absolutely fabulous (it's intense so I would go simple with the rest of the face), not to sticky but its hard to put it on thin sometimes b/c the brush holds a lot of product. ",0
"I bought the Vanilla Cinnamon one, and I love the creamy scent. It smells like real vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg, however, when I used it the smell didn't really linger. It was too faint for my liking, yet, I loved how hydrating it feels, and not at all drying, as well as it consisting of natural ingredients. ",0
"I bought the warm ivory. I didn't like it much. It was very drying. Even when applying it, you really had to work it to get the foundation to cover your entire face b/c it dried so quickly. I felt like my foundation was caked on, very unnatural feeling. The funny thing is, as drying as it went on, I still had a lot of oil in my t-zone area. I have better luck with mineral foundation. ",2
"I bought this about a week ago. I do like the lip gloss, but you can sort of feel the glitter/sparkles when you rub your lips together. I like the shimmer and use it as eye shadow. The mascara is nice, but it does clump a bit. But I think that it's the perfect size for a night out in a clutch or other small bag. Worth the money. ",0
"I bought this after all the hype in my local Houston sephora - couldn't get it in store so I ordered online. What a disappointment - if you are looking for mascara to ""tube"" your lashes then look somewhere else like Blinc. Texas lash flakes, is clumpy, wet/sticks to my eyelids when applying and is hard to get off compared to Blinc. You can do better for the money. I have used many other Cargo products and been very satisfied - not again for this one.... ",2
"I bought this after hearing that it makes pores appear smaller. I didn't notice any results with that, however it did gave a long lasting matte finish for my oily skin. I also notice that my make up stays on longer while using it. So I love it as primer, but will continue my search for a pore minimizer. ",0
"I bought this after I read all these rave reviews... but I'll be honest, I didn't expect it to work as good as everyone says because my eyeshadow literally creases 5 minutes after I put it on. Today, it is 85 degress, I walked up 104 steps to the hospital where I work/ go to class. Walked up more steps to my lab on the 3rd floor, where it was 80 degress inside. Case in point, I was sweating. My eyeshadow did not crease AT ALL, and 7 hours later, it still hasn't! I am absoultely amazed. ",0
"I bought this after reading all of the great reviews, it really does make my skin brighter and more youthful looking. It's very gentle, I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any problems. I would highly recommend, there is a reason it is the best of Sephora!",0
"I bought this after reading a review in a magazine. I love it and will never use anything else. This does it all. Cleanser, toner, and makeup remover. It's great when you're in a rush and don't have time to do an entire face cleansing routine. It does a great job at removing makeup. You don't have to rinse after using it and it leaves your face feeling dewy. I highly recommend this to anyone. ",2
"I bought this after sampling it because I like that it didn't make my armpits feel dry or flaky. After a week I noticed the darkness I had after having my baby had a cleared up quite a bit. However, the protection is not all that great perhaps b/c I still have post-pregnancy hormones and nothing really works for me. :(",1
I bought this along with her mineral foundation (which I like) because I have very oily skin but I did not find that this primer made any difference in oil breakthrough. I also let my daughter-in-law try because she also has oily skin and she was not impressed.,4
"I bought this along with the scrub, which I just wrote a fantastic review on as well and rated 5 stars, and I cannot say enough good things about it! I finally gave these products a try after reading all of the reviews. I've had redness and bumps all over my arms all my life, I've been using the scrub and this lotion (by the way, a little does go a very long way) and my arms have been so smooth, and immediately after I shower, scrub and apply the moisturizer, my skin is glistening smooth! I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and totally notice the difference and am loving every bit of it. I definitely recommend buying both, save up for it if you must, I did! Didn't know why I went so long without trying this product!",1
"I bought this as a gift and when I saw the gorgeous colors and fun mascara and brushes, I just had to get one for myself, too! I have to be honest, I haven't used it yet but I sure checked out all the pieces before I wrapped it up and placed it under the tree...FOR MYSELF! ",2
"I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law and fell in love with the scent, so I bought it for myself. You only need a little bit for this fantastic lather and the most yummy, sensual scent that luckily doens't last all day or they would think that Grandma was baking all day long.",4
Ibought this as a gift to my hubby as he sufferes from dermatisis (dry skin condition) during winter.\nHe used this product and loved it. I have bought him another tube as this is the only other product outside of a can that he uses happily. The prrice is reasonable & shave is awesome :),1
I bought this as a present for my best friend for her birthday. She loved it! She said they all smell amazing and the scent stays! This is a great gift it comes in an adorable package...perfect for the holidays! ,0
I bought this as a sample and fell in love. I spray it on my hair before heat styling and find it holds the curl and helps straighten. It adds shine and a bit of texture and makes your hair smell fantastic. ,1
"I bought this at first to use for my Stila Smudge Pot. I hated it. Yes, it did give me straight lines. But it takes a lot of getting used to and practice. I think that if you want a brush for cream/gel eyeliners, go get a bent/angled brush. They're much easier to use. I use this now for packing on eye shadow and defining my outer edge and other things like that. ",0
"I bought this a while ago becuse I have constant breakouts and wanted to try something different. It worked well but it dried out my skin and I have very oliy skin. I stopped using it because I didnt want it to completely dry it out, it's good to use if you can every other day. But I dont recommend for consistant use ",0
I bought this based on a tube of the eye creme that I received as a sample. I loved the product and the fact it had sunscreen. But the packaging just doesn't make sense. The opening is so narrow that I would have needed a tool to get it out once you got past the first little amount--and I have short nails! I sent it back because it was so frustrating. ,4
i BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE WARM COTTON AND I LOVE IT. THE OTHER SCENTS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THE ORIGINAL CLEAN I DON'T CARE FOR AT ALL. THE SHOWER FRESH IS TRUE TO ITS NAME. CLEAN ULTIMATE REMINDS OF LEVER 2000 SOAP. THESE ALL LAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT ARE NEVER OVERPOWERING OR OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS. ,2
"I bought this because I loved my Clinique Rock Violet pencil which they stopped making. This eyeshadow is terribly disappointing. It is neither crease-proof nor is it smudge-proof. It doesn't even have staying power. Plus, it is gloppy. ",2
"I bought this because it got rave reviews from Sephora & was looking for a new cleanser. I used this 3 times and decided this was not for me. I have dry skin & did not find this very helpful. I found it to be harsh, stripping, & my skin felt drier after use and very taut. I put my usual moisturizer after use & found that I needed to apply more after it soaked in. I don't think I would recommend this for mature or dry skin.",1
"I bought this because I travel a lot. I love that I can use it for quick touch ups right before landing so I look and taste yummy for my hunny when he picks me up from the airport. The eye con feels great on tired eyes and makes them look brighter. The California Kissin reminds me of home (Cali), tastes great, smells minty, and shines beautifully. The benetint is my fav blush on the go! The Some Kind-A Gorgeous is okay, I haven't really used it...BUT it's all very convenient and has a handy dandy mirror! ",0
I bought this because it was inexpensive and have since used it everyday and bought another shade for summer skin. This concealer does not show dry skin like a spotlight and is great after a long night on the town. ,0
"I bought this because I was traveling and did not want to worry about a loose powder mess. In order to get in out, you have to shake the brush. Powder spills every where!!! And I did not like the consistency at all. ",1
"I bought this blush on a whim because it had been so popular. I completely know why! I bought it in Orgasm and the color went on great, stayed on and was a perfect amount of pigment. This color looks amazing on so many different skin tones as well...",0
"I bought this book and then I returned it because it wasn't really what I thought it would be. I thought it would be something with ways to do different makeup styles. It ended up being more like a catalog for sephora, that unfortunately was pretty expensive! There are a few tricks and tips in there, but not enough to make it worth the money ",0
I bought this brush and at first thought it was stiff and may have been to hard to apply anything with. I was so wrong! It was the perfect brush for cream eyeliner application. My second one is used as a lip brush and it gives you percise application. Great Brush! ,2
i bought this cleanser in a sephora store. a sephora beauty rep recommended it for breakouts. i used it for 2 weeks and started breaking out worse than i had previously. this product is not what i needed.,1
I bought this cleanser on a whim and was slightly taken aback when I realized you had to use a cotton pad to use this cleanser but I have to say I love it. I used to only wash my face at night but this cleanser is so refreshing that I've become a morning convert. This never leaves my skin feeling dry and after putting it on your face it dries in seconds so you there isn't a long wait to put on moisturizer. ,0
I bought this color online from the Sephora. I much say I like the color alot. It's peachy with a little bronze. I'm very fair and Luster works well with my skin tone. The staying power is excellent. lasts all day.,4
"I bought this cream for my daughter who works outside as a geologist. She loves it. It protects her skin from the sun, but is not heavy or greasy like sunscreens and also moisturizes. There are no breakouts and her skin stays healthy. ",3
"I bought this for a gift for my hard to please daughter and I'm sure she will love the unique-ness of it. What a great idea,I can't wait for her to m open it. The sample perfumes are all top notch-agreat way to actually wear for more than 2 mins in a store to pick what it really smells like, ",3
"I bought this for a girlfriend who was looking for a longer lasting shadow. She won't wear anyting else. Loves the way it smoothes on her eyes, never tugging and loves the lasting vibrant colors she uses..... ",3
I bought this for my 8-year old granddaughter (who loves to play with Nana's makeup!) and was really surprised at how cool it is. The products are age appropriate and the treasure box is very sturdy. I would highly recommend it for any little girl who loves to play dress up! ,3
"I bought this for my boyfriend, who has whiskers you can light a match with. Of course, I had to road test it for him. I got the closest shave ever on my bikini line (and legs), even with a slightly dull razor. So far, no ingrowns either, which is a chronic problem of mine. I think I might get some for me now....because it has a gender neutral scent, too. Minty/eucalyptus-y.",1
I bought this for my choco loving coworker and was thrilled when it arrived!!! It comes in a super cute reusable tin and all the substantial sized balms smell wonderful! I know she will just love it!!! ,1
"I bought this for my teenager, who has similar skin to me, with a severe Blackhead problem and it has worked wonders!!!! I have tried it as well and it does not dry out skin while pulling out gunk like other clay masks.However, use more than once a week and it could leave red scald-like marks that fade after a few days. The smell is not THAT bad and does not linger onthe skin but would recommend showering AFTER use as it takes a bit of scrubbing to get off. ",2
"I bought this for my teenage son seveal years ago, hoping it would help his acne. thought maybe he would use it beause it was made for men. Worked wonders and now his skin is clear. He even realizes it and reminds me to buy more when he is running low!! ",3
I bought this gloss in Mongo soda and it smells great. The gloss stays on your lips for a long time and the color is VERY sheer more of a tint but I still like it. Also it's not all super sticky. The only reason I gave this a 4 is because it DOES NOT plump whatsoever. But it's a great gloss for everyday use. ,0
"I bought this gloss in the peachy pink universally flattering shade that starts with an 'o'. . . maybe in blush it flatters everyone but definitely not in gloss. I was not impressed with this gloss, it's very sticky/gunky and washes me out if I'm not careful. Not to mention it isn't all that shiny. ",0
"I bought this hopeful that it would help out my puffy eyes in the morning... and I havent noticed a difference yet. I've been using it for a few weeks now and no major changes, but it does help to brighten the eye area. It does feel nice though, very soothing! ",0
"I bought this hoping to stop that hated midday shine. However, the product itself gave an appearance of shine, even after the application of powder. The velvety texture is the redeeming quality of this product. In short, buy this product as a primer but do not expect much shine control. ",0
"I bought this in ""Bettina"" to fill out my lips and compliment my medium-golden skin. The first thing I noticed was how smoothly and easily it glided on, and the second thing I noticed was how good it looked! Like other NARS products, it is very pigment-rich, so it lasted most of the day and looked very good - no weird feathering or fading. VERY moisturizing...as a plus :) Enjoy!",0
I bought this in Disco Blue to try something different but I really didn't like it. It is too clumpy and I feel like it weighs my lashes down. The part of it being flake resistant is pretty accurate. Other than that I was not impresed.. ,0
"I bought this in May and it's been the only scent I have worn ever since. And I have a drawer of at least 20 different fragrances--but I just loooove the way this one makes me feel. Light, sweet, pretty, and not a too-overwhelming floral.",1
"I bought this in Rumi Joon. The color is a perfect natural color for me. Normally I don't like lipstick, my lips can get dry in the desert climate where I live. This lipstick is just so soothing to wear Doesn't feel at all drying like many do. And it stays on nicely. I didn't expect that from a lipstick so silky and creamy. Makes me feel great to wear it! It's even replacing my favorite gloss for what I put on as I run out the door. And I didn't think any lipstick could ever do that. ",4
i bought this in the org@sm shade because i've heard so many great things about it & it really does live up to it. i work as a makeup artist and this looks great on everyone! it's so complementing for every skin tone and gives the right pop of color on the cheeks. must have for every artist.,0
"I bought this in the popular ""O"" shade for myself, my sister, and sister-in-law. We are different skin tones and believe it or not, this looked great on each of us. It is a very versatile color; somewhat neutral and unimposing. It goes on smooth and does not feel sticky. Definitely one of my favorite glosses. ",3
"I bought this item, as I was looking for something not too heavy. This product is not heavy. It is also very long lasting and good for your skin. However, it does not cover blemishes. If you use concealer with it, it will cake. I wear it on a ""clear"" day, but otherwise, I don't use it. It is perfect for ladies with discoloration problems, or mild redness (rosacea). It is also perfect for oily skin types...But NOT for acne. ",1
"I bought this kit because I adore anything ruby. The kit was the typical bare essentials but the colors were a bit much if you aren't into drama make-up. I really loved the Ruby Boxom lip gloss but the only way to get it is to buy the whole kit. The other colors are too much ""make-up"" for my needs which is why I rated this fair and not beter. They should offer the lip colors separately because a great blue based red is hard to come by. ",3
"I bought this kit to try the eye primer as I already use the foundation primer which I find to be as good as if not better than others, especially for the price. It definitely does make a huge difference when applying the mineral foundations as they glide onto the skin evenly. I was using BE a long time before I decided to prime my face with this product and what a difference! You will be pleased with the results, much more so than without it. Same goes for the eye primer. I only wish the eye primer was offered in a larger size. ",4
"I bought this last christmas prior to traveling. I really liked the milk, but I didnt see anything special with the products. The toner is nice, don't get much of a feel for the tightening of my pores.. I have yet to use the rest. ",0
"I bought this lip gloss to replace Benefit's now discontinued ""Kiss"" (not Kiss Me or Kiss You). The shade is great for a little somethng color, but not overly obvious you're wearng color. The product itself is everything I look for in a good gloss: not tacky. It's also pretty long-wearing for a lip gloss. I am certainy eyeing other shades.",2
"I bought this mascara b/c I hear it works well, but when I tried it, it was a disaster! It neither lengthened nor volumized my lashes, but it did clump my lashes into little clumps! Try it for yourself before buying it, it might not work on you. ",0
"I bought this mascara thinking it would be good stuff. I was disappointed. It seemed clumpy in the tube and was clumpy on my lashes. I had to use a lash brush to straighten everything out. Assuming I got an old tube or something, I threw it way and figured I stick with my normal mascara. Then I bought a Tarte set and one came in the set. It, too, was clumpy. It's good mascara, adds volume and length, but I hate clumps. I want to put it on and go, not comb my lashes out afterwards.",1
"I bought this mask because i started breaking out all along my jawline. I am 50 years old and in peri-menopause, but feels like my skin is going through purberty right now. This mask seems to work fine, i apply it twice a week, leave it on for 15 minutes. ",3
I bought this on a whim because of some ads I saw. I don't find the lip gloss that useful but I love the whitening aspect. It lasts for about 2 weeks. I have very sensitive teeth and I usually use GoSmile. But this is something to use in between then plus the price is the best around. ,0
"I bought this on the recommendation of a sephora makeup artist when i could not decided which primer i would like to try. I have been a little lax on using it often enough, just because it is an extra step in my routine, but when i do use it i am happy with it. however, when i first apply, it seems to bring out the redness in my skin, but once the makeup goes on it is fine. when i run out, i will probably not buy again however, because of the price and i am not WOWED by it",0
"I bought this pencil about 3 weeks ago. I was curious about filling in the ""bare spots"" in my eyebrows. I've never used a brow pencil before and I must say that this one is a breeze to use. I have Black hair and amazingly the brunette blends well. I gave it 4 stars only because I have to keep it sharpened to a fine point every time I use it otherwise the color doesn't draw on well. I love how it holds up in the heat of Hawaii's weather too!",1
"I bought this pencil after reading many glowing reviews on Make Up Alley. I was very disappointed. The color of he pencil is perfect for me, and I've looked for a long time to find one, but the pencil itself is as hard as a rock. Needless to say, it doesn't make for ""natural"" looking eyebrows on me and actually hurts to apply. Sorry all! ",4
"I bought this pencil in black and brown specifically since I work twelve hour days and dont want my eyeliner to give out on me. The colors are rich and velvety-they draw on like a dream, but by eleven a.m. I would be in the bathroom trying to fix my raccoon eyes. I ultimately just gave up on them.",1
"I bought this powder because it was one of the few at Sephora that was light enough for me to use on my fair skin without turning yellowy. I know this product is positioned to allow use of the different tones on their own, but I just whisked the [very nice] enclosed brush across the top of the panes of color in the compact, and applied it. the colors blended nicely into a soft, neutral translucent powder. the container is very luxe, and the brush is soft, and I was glad to have a powder that would work with my skin tone. it IS a very nice powder, all in all, if a bit pricey, and leaves a nice velvety finish. ",2
"I bought this product after a Sephora employee recommended it to me. The first time I used it I was not impressed. In fact, I thought that maybe I was not using the pencil correctly. It smudged too easily, even when applied on top of a base, and did not last long. Not very flattering on my fair skin. I think you can find a similar product in a drugstore and get a better deal. ",0
"I bought this product after reading reviews in beauty magazine and found they were very accurate. I recently wore this perfume to a black tie party and every man who danced with me, all commented "" You are absolutely intoxicating; what are you wearing?"" as they leaned in to me to take in more of the scent. What else can I say about this perfume? It's very classy, sensuous, although not overpowering, and very ,very memorable.. Do get some ladies, I promise you will not be disappointed. ",3
"I bought this product after seeing it on the models in a fashion magazine. On the models, appilied by make-up artists it produced breath taking results. So when I got home I opened the compact and applied the make-up. I thought it looked quite lovely, but imagine my surprise when the first person I saw told me I looked like I had Angel Eyes! Due most likely to the subtle shimmer of the shadows. Easy to apply, very long lasting, and Voila! Angel Eyes! ",3
"I bought this product along with the glossing shampoo and conditioner. While it did make my hair shiny after blowdrying, it began to look a little greasy and weighed down by the end of the day. I dont know that I would continue to use this product after I finish the bottle up. ",0
I bought this product because I ejoy the Youth As We Know it moisturizer. This product doesn't leave my skin feeling clean. It feels rather oily. I like to use a refreshing product that makes my skin glow. I wouldn't recommend this product and I won't be buying it again. ,3
"I bought this product because I heard great reviews about it in magazines. After trying it for a few days, my skin got even drier and it even felt rough. It does not work at all and not worth the money. ",2
"I bought this product because I liked the look of the tin and I like Schweppes Tonic Water. Though it didn't taste much like tonic, it has a pleasant ""taste"" and is a great moisturizer--especially now during this cold, dry Midwest Winter! I'd definitely purchase this lip balm again. ",4
"I bought this product because in the description it has a quote that seems to say that it works on inner rims and this product does not have any staying power whatsoever on the inner rims. So... other than that this is just another kohl eye pencil. I liked the color, but I can achieve this with a liquid liner that actually lasts all day with no smudging. Nothing special here. Very disapointing. ",1
I bought this product because it is supposed to be smudge and budge proof and line the inner rim of the eyes. This product does not work at all as it states it does. Before I am done putting on my makeup this stuff is already faded off my inner rims. VERY disapointing. ,1
"I bought this product because I was out of the eyeshadow primer so I went online to order it and noticed they had it packaged with this eyeshadow palette for not that much more, it has so many colors and many of which i was thinking about purchasing...a great deal! ",0
"I bought this product because the staff described it as very close to the smashbox primer, and it may be, but I wouldn't say that the product primes my skin. I would say that it creates a layer of moisture which might be good for some, but it makes me feel like my face is oily. I imagine for older skin it does keep makeup from settling, but I wouldn't suggest it for the under 30 crowd. ",1
"I bought this product for my daughter, it does thicken lashes and does not flake, clumps occassionally but rarely. Our biggest complaint was that it didn't seem to last long at all, in other words it ran out fast, she seemed to use it up faster than other products we used.",2
"I bought this product for my wedding day makeup - which I decided to do myself since I know what I like best. Its great, cares for skin while making sure makeup stays in place. And, makeup in photos came out looking great.",2
"I bought this product to give as a Christmas gift, so I can't tell you about the products themselves. I thought the packaging was quite clever, and that it was a great gift for someone that lives (or goes to school) up north where it's cold and dry! ",4
"I bought this product to use on my big dry naturally curly hair. I loved the feel of it, but unfortunately, because the wonderful essential oil fragrance was so strong, I had to return it. If you have fragrance sensitive eyes, this product may not work for you. If not... it is a fabulous feeling mid weight curl lotion. A little on the oily side, but if your hair is dry .. try it. ",3
"I bought this scent for my husband, and I'm impressed! I love this aroma. It's very clean and green. The dominant note I can pick out is of cedar. Like taking a walk in the woods after a rain! It's very unique smelling and not at all overpowering. Love it!!!",2
"I bought this scent last year because I loved the fresh sweetness to it, and loved that it wasn't overpowering.\n\nOne year later, it still sits in the box, I think I used it once, maybe twice.\n\nVery boring smell, tires verrrry quickly. It also has an unpleasant chemical tone when you spray too much of it.\n\nPlus is it's not a very expensive perfume, but still I feel like I threw my money away. Wont buy it again.",0
"I bought this set about 4 months ago and while i am obsessed with the flat iron, the products that came with are nothing worth trying. I thought they all had a funny smell to them and the flat iron heat protect spray made my long hair very greasy. I do like the heat proof travel bag that came with it though, its very pracitcal and has a cute design. ",0
"I bought this somewhere else first, but when I went back to get more they were out. I knew Sephora carried L'Occitane brand. So, I was glad you had this. I put it everywhere on my body. It's great for winter leg dryness. I've even put it on my face and neck if they are unusually dry. ",4
"I bought this thinking how great to only need mascara every 4 days. Not the case, my eyelashes were so sticky, and forget it if you wear contact lenses, I felt like my lenses were also coated. My lashes feel sticky and look clumpy...this is going back, today. ",2
"I bought this to cover the redness of my eyelids, and to cover undereye circles. It is quite effective, but I think it is too dry, and it requires tugging on that gentle skin to apply. Maybe it is normally more creamy and I just happened to get a dry one. The sample seemed creamy, but mine isn't. ",4
"I bought this today in love bites after much contemplation. I have other Too Faced glosses but I wanted something new. i really like the coverage as well as the color. It goes on smoothly without being overtly sticky or gloppy. the applicator has a good shape, almost like new lipstick, which makes it really easy to apply. it also has a pleasent scent and taste. ",0
"I bought this to line the inner lower eyelid. The right consistency is difficult to mix, and unless it is just right, the liner seeps down onto the lower eyelid. I notice my eyes burning after a couple of hours, and quit using this product after the irritation continued even after removal. It also did not stay on well, flaking into my eye area. ",4
"I bought this to replace one I received in a kit where the brush was short handled. The closer you hold a brush to the hairs the more color you deposit, If you want a light sweep of color for bronzers, illuminators or blushes then this is THE brush to own. The quality is excellent and as a closet pack-rat I can not say that I will pitch the old one that came with a kit but I know for sure that it is definitely going to be placed in my back up cubbie, ",4
"I bought this to take to a Christmas gift exchange party and got my own gift back! These creams are non-greasy, absorb quickly, smell wonderful - but lightly scented - they will not overwhelm your perfume. These are 3 1 ounce tubes. You use only a small amount so they will last quite a while, but each tube is small with a screw-top - great for throwing into your handbag. I really like these. ",3
I bought this to try out the line. While I really liked the smell of the products I didn't see any difference with my hair versus my normal shampoo which is less expensive. I would not buy the full size products. ,1
"I bought this wanting a very neutral creamy shadow and I was not disappointed. The finish has a subtle but noticeable glisten which is perfect for my not-so-perfect middle age eyelids. The color is a gorgeous shade, just enough pigment to color but still remain sheer. I don't know why anyone would wear powder shadow when you can wear gorgeous color with a really beautiful finish like this. I did need just a teeny bit of shadow primer but stayed beautiful all day. ",3
I bought this with high hopes and was a little disappointed. This mascara does give full lashes but I find the formula very dry and it clumps easily after one coat. A much better alternative it Diorshow Iconic. It is clump-free and much more fluid in texture. ,0
"I bought this with the Balance and Brighten and have dramatically shortened my makeup time. It is easy to apply and doesn't build up or look cakey. It is perfect for the quick face, and can also work for a more made-up look. I don't have to touch it up; it lasts all day. ",4
I bought three of these mini tweezers as stocking stuffers since my husband loved the ones I gave him for his birthday around Thanksgiving. The tension is great. I was happily surprised that I also received a pair in my own Christmas stocking. ,4
"I bought two of these for Christmas gifts and it comes in the cutest packing that looks like a log holder. I wish I could open them and smell everything, but I'm sure everything inside is yummy-licious! I can't wait to give them! ",1
I bought two of these for Christmas gifts for girls that work at the salon I frequent. They absolutely loved them. They actually called me to tell me how much they loved them. The packaging is really cool and the lip glosses aren't teeny. They aren't full size but they are certainly big enough. Definitely worth the money!! ,2
"I BOUOGHT THIS SET FOR MY GIRLFRIEND AND GOT ONE FOR MYSELF CAUSE I LIKED IT SO WELL. THE PRICE WAS PERFECT AND I LOVE BRIGHT TROPICAL COLORS; GREEN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE COLOR AND THE PACKAGING ARE IN SYNCH. NOT ONLY DOES IT SMELL GOOD, BUT IT COMPLIMENTS THE BATHROOM. GIRLFRIEND IS HAPPY WITH IT AND SO AM I. YES, WE BE LOVING THIS AND CAN'T WAIT TO TRY ANOTHER. ",4
I came across this brush while shopping for others and I must say for the price it is definitely a handy tool to have on hand. I have a very old version of a similar syle brush with comb teeth which are plastic and a few are broken. I also own a separate comb with metal teeth and a short handle. With this tool I can pitch the plastic which was not much good when it was new and have both the brush and metal-teeth comb in one. I love it! ,4
"I came back and bought the full size of this product after receiving it as a sample. It absorbs nicely and makes my skin feel fresh and not greasy afterward. Smells fresh too and I can tell a difference in brightness overall since I started using it twice daily, along with the Full Strength Peel 2 times a week. Definitely would recommend to friends. ",3
"I can get a lot of shine esp by the end of the day...so I've been using this daily before applying my makeup. I think that it definitely does help, but I'm trying to decide if it's worth it. I think it is. It goes on easily and smoothly, dries quickly (not drying), and smells fine. ",1
"I can go without any other item in my makeup bag, but this, this I have to use every day. It's the best eyelash curler ever!!! It doesn't pinch and gets close to the eye without irritating it. It's a staple for any makeup bag....I have four. :) ",1
"I cannot begin to explain how useless this product is! It made me look like I was trying to be a geisha or something. It made me pale as death, and I used a tiny amount too. Does not blend well. Kind of just settles into the contours of your face. I promptly returned it. Wish I could have kept the brush though, it was so soft and plush! ",0
I cannot believe it has taken me this long to be introduced to this fantastic aroma! Its aromatherapeutic abilities took me on a journey of simple sophistication. It took me back to a time when I THOUGHT I was grown-up; when simple romantic things filled you with elation. ,2
"I cannot be without this product. I have had several large sun/age spots on my hand, and one was particularly large and quite dark (and I am fair skined). Nothing worked for me until I tried this product. After using it for about 2 months, the spots are hardly noticeable and barely there. I used to have to put foundation on, no more. This product is amazing, now I don't feel so self-concious anymore. Love this product!!!!!",4
i cannot get enough of this ultra feminine fragrance. i love the smell and the way it makes me feel. i always get compliments on it. the fragrance lasts throughout my day-no reapplication needed. a must buy!,1
"I can not say enough about this amazing product. I first got it in a deluxe sample with the exfoliant and I fell in love. When I saw the price I was apprehensive but I knew how much I loved the sample so I went for it. WOW I am so glad I did. This has to be the best product I have ever used. It is light, smells great and leaves your skin rosy and glowing. I use it twice a week and I cannot say enough about this. Try it you will be VERY glad you did !! ",3
"I cannot say enough good things about the Philosophy products in this kit! This collection made such a difference in my already good skin! The clarity and smoothness are greatly enhanced, and the winter dryness is all but gone! Love this stuff! ",3
I can now mix my own shadow color combos or even blush combos...just by using the same brand and mixing it together well I can just dip my brush and go. Plus you can see through the lids to see the color. ,2
"I can't believe the rave reviews for this brush. It's very soft, but the outside case dents easily and is juvenile looking. I feel it's overpriced too. I'll take a natural hair quality makeup brush anyday. ",4
I can't do without Moisture Surge or All About Eyes - they are fantastic! It was nice to get to try the Spray -- it's perfect for freshing up your face and giving the extra bit of moisture during the day without disturbing your make-up. Adds much needed moisture with the change of seasons! ,2
"I can't ever seem to get my foundation right. Applying concealer looks like I spackled my face.And bronzer? Forget it! I thought I was hopeless! And then, I found this. It gives you everything you need to create a beautiful look. I got a lot of compliments on my complexion perfection, which just goes to show how inept I was before. The DVD was a disappointment-too short and no further tips. ",3
"i can't give it zero stars! i think this should state that it's best for very fair skin (like caucasian women). i have dark asian skin, and this stuff looked like green paste. i tapped it on, and it still looked green. it went back to the store. ",2
"I can't live without this product. Without this none of my eyeshadows would stay. The only thing that's not so great is the packaging because at the bottom, it seems to collect more primer & you can't get the wand to go there. Other than that it's the greatest primer ever. ",0
"i can't overstate how much i love this product. it's a great thin, smooth texture, it doesn't taste or smell strongly of anything weird, it doesn't leave your lips goopy or sticky - just moist, like lip balm. i've recommended it to other people and they get hooked, too. if i was on a desert island, i think this might be the beauty product i'd want with me. ",1
I can't say anything good or bad about this product. When I try a product like this I need to be wowed by it in order to justify spending money on something rather than using a washcloth. I am sorry to say that I was not impressed. ,2
I can't say enough about this scent..IT'S MY PICK ME UP SCENT..I can just sniff the spray and I am in a great mood..this Light Blue is awesome and the scent lingers for a long time..I love that in a perfume/cologne..I wish they made some products for your hair of this aura,4
"I can't say enough good things about the Amazing Grace line. The scent is so pleasing, and just right so that I don't overpower people. The shower gel makes me feel SO pampered and the body lotion really does firm my skin.",4
"I can't say that this shampoo makes my hair look full and thick because that would be an impossibility, but it makes my fine and thin hair look the absolute best it can look. I use it along with the conditioner and some other after shampoo/conditioning products and still use Velcro rollers to get some added volume. I've used a lot of different products and this is my favorite in the shampoo category. ",4
"I cant tell you how often people stop me and say, boy do you smell great. What are you wearing? I have to take a minute to remember that I put on Daisy hours ago and I didnt even realize that I still smelled from it. Its so light and clean smelling, but it does say on and people love that fresh smell",4
"I chose #213 Silky Sunset because I always like purples, and because the duo seemed to be the only one likely to look good on my extremely pale, cool toned skin and dark brown eyes. It has exceeded the expectations and is easily my biggest pleasant makeup surprise of the year. The light pink is very light, but works perfectly with the lavender-purple. The two blend easily and last all day. They don't rub off if you happen to rub an eye (assuming the use of an eyeshadow primer). I've had no problem with creasing or fading. Most importantly, they can be layered to be subtle or not, as the wearer pleases. Those who don't like shimmer should be aware that both shadows do have a slight shimmer. It's too bad that the tiny brushes which come with the duo are useless. Finally, I'd never recommend a product based on the packaging, but I very much like the sleek look of this little compact. ",2
"I chose this product for my whitening regimen because it claimed to be the only one on the market to work on crowned, capped, bonded teeth as well as natural teeth. Having many crowns I chose to plunk down my 90 bucks. Wish I didn't. No difference whatsoever, not even in my natural teeth. ",2
"I combine Oscar Blandi's Jasmine Oil Serum and Curling Serum for use on my naturally curly, color-treated hair... a trick suggested by an associate in a NY Sephora store...along with a small amount of another company's conditioning volumizing foam. I love the way my hair looks and feels! ",4
"I consider myself to be a mascara junky. I have tried virtually anything and everything expensive to build, lengthen, volumize and give my eye lashes that full, sexy, va va voom look. I first tried this product months ago, but in the Navy Blue color. I loved it. I loved the texture, the long lasting lengthening and the glimmer of color that just added the extra pizzaz I was hoping to achieve. The black color just received does not seem to give me the same affect. I like it, but I'm not loving it. The product is very, very good. I like this line very much. But, my next order will be for the Navy instead of the Black. ",3
"I could have sworn there were roses in this perfume. It's beautiful, girly without being sweet, and ethereal. It isn't necessarily ""pink"" to me, as it's floral but includes a bit of greenness. Very daytime. ",0
"I could not be happier with this kit. It includes a perfect matte bronzer, a tasty, cherry lip gloss that's not sticky and mascara for perfectly seperated, dark lashes. Plus, you know the ingredients are good for your skin and from the earth. I will definitely buy more Korres products after using this kit! ",1
"I could not believe how amazing this product is. By using it on top of my foundation, it transforms my skin instantly to a dewy finish. And suddenly, there is a young-looking, silky finish with no pores showing! This product helps give me a youthful complexion, for someone in their mid-fifties!",4
I couldn't believe how great my face looked once i started to use this. I even had a patient whom had seen me using other blushes & asked what I was doing because I had never looked better. If you try it you'll become a fan too. ,4
"I couldn't have been more disappointed. I'm returning my order. I had such high hopes. I have very difficult, dry, tangly hair. I loved the idea of buttering up my locks. I really thought this stuff would do the trick. Au Contraire. It's thick, and sticky, and did nothing but make my hair a tangled, thicky sticky mess. ",3
"i couldn't wait for it to come in the mail. i'd read all the reviews about organsm but i cannot get it light enough. i was hoping it would be more of a pink color WHICH IT IS NOT. it is more of a bright color. i like be sorbet and i guess i will stick with that one. this one goes back i'm sorry to say. it has staying power, it just isn't even a little pink.",4
"I could put up with the tingling, burning sensation if I actually saw a difference for more than half an hour. So, bottom line is -- What's the point of hassling with it? I'll give this one a pass from now on. ",4
"I'd been neglecting my cheek brush for a long time, and it had turned completely pink. After I used this brush shampoo, the brush looked as good as new! It didn't lather into foam like hair shampoo, though...",1
"I debated about buying this brush as well for a long time and now that I have it I am so glad! I do not know why I waited so long. There are a number of angled ""contour"" brushes out there and I own a couple of them but this by far is THE BEST ! The brush is full,round,soft and yet compact at the base and the tip is definitely angled so the delivery of color is controlled and exact. This makes working with your shadows so easy, the colors go exactly where you want them, not all over an area! ",4
"I debated a long time about buying a ""duster"" but let's face it. I have been dealing with fragments of powders under my lower lashes for much longer than I spent debating whether or not to get this brush. I came to the conclusion that if I was willing to invest in other good quality brushes, I should include this brush too! I have owned a lesser quality fan brush (note the past tense) which was less expensive, flimsy and worthless. It sat around for a long time until I finally got rid of it. This brush accomplishes more than just ""dust off the crumbs"" if you want to use it for a light application of bronzer or illuminating powder. This brush would be excellent for both as it is soft yet full and substantial enough do deliver any form of powder you like. I am so glad that I got it! ",4
"I decided to try the Laura Mercier eye liner since I like the tinted moisturizer. This color lacks pizazz and is just too light for my tastes. I do not like how it goes on at all. I always use liquid eye liner; however, I won't use this one. ",4
"I decided to try the Ojon thickening spray. I have baby fine hair and I am always looking for a good volumizing product. To be honest, I wasn't really impressed with this product. I really did not notice any extra volume. I'm glad I purchased the small size. ",2
"I defintely love this product! It gives you a warm, sun-kissed glow that's great for your face day or night. All you need is a dime size amount and it covers your face completely. It defintely lights up your skin without it looking like you have on too much make-up. It goes great with foundation too. Great product! ",0
"I desperately wish this worked. I'm only 18 years old, I eat healthy foods, I get plenty of sleep, but still I've had under eye circles for 3 years or so now. They just won't go away. After I use this product I really see no difference at all. ",0
I'd have to say that I do not complete my look without Nars Blush. I even bought the multiple to use on the go. It gives your skin a natural sun-kissed look during any season. The hint of sparkle makes your face stand out and shimmer.,0
"I'd heard how good the NARS products are, needed blush & decided to try this. For the first time in a long time, I actually got a compliment on my ""makeup""! And, a little goes a long way - as well as lasting all day.",4
"I did like parts of it in the beginning. I loved the brushes, still use them. The final step, blending powder looked very white on me. I wouldn't buy it again due to trying other things but enjoyed it while it lasted. ",3
I did like the shampoo & conditioner although they're a little pricey. The Hydrating Mask is very heavy and made my hair feel waxy and greasy. I have fine fair and you can imagine how this would not work well with my hair type. ,3
"I did not care for this pencil. it has an odd, waxy consistency that made application difficult. it also seems to be low on pigment. it smeared pretty quickly also. oh well- lots of other GREAT Sephora eye products to choose from. ",2
"I did not like how this applied. It just seemed to crumble all over the place. Was almost like just dropping regular glitter on my face. Maybe i was doing something wrong, but I use many products like this and this one i would not buy again. ",1
"I did not like this product at all. This was my second try at color coordination -- I have lighter hair with low lights and high lights. I have tried two colors now, the second being the medium blond which I thought looked like mustard on my hair, plus the fact that it was sticky and gooey and made my scalp itch. Couldn't wait to wash it out. ",4
"I did not like this stuff at all. I'd be better off using baby powder. First of all, I only got about three applications out of the entire can, not worth the money. I had a hard time combing it through my hair. I have dark hair and I could see all the white stuff in my hair no matter how much I tried to brush it out. Didn't like the smell either. ",2
I didn't buy this product first from Sephora but bought it at a departent store when the salesgirl told me she used to work in Vegas and the show girls bought this stuff by the case so that their makeup would stay on through four shows a night. That sold me. I have not been disappointed. It is the real deal. I dab a very small amount on the top of my hand and then dip the brushes into it in order to not contaminate the bottle. Works like a charm. This means I can wear any of my favorite products (I wear almost exclusively bareEscentials) and they stay on even longer. What a wonderful thing to get what you pay for! ,4
"I didn't feel the warming, tingling, heating sensation that's supposedly so great. I've used it several times and I just don't get it. It smells good, but I don't really think that it's that great as far as a moisturizer either. ",0
"I didn't have high hopes for this purchase, but thought it might be a good thing to have around to doodle with while watching tv. The surprise - YES, it is a good thing to doodle with while watching tv but it also conditions the cuticles and extends your manicure. I give it 2 thumbs up for improving the appearance of overused hands. ",4
"i didn't know i was supposed to change curlers every 6 months. just read that on line. can't find the replacement pad that comes with it so i guess i will just have to buy a new curler and keep up with the pad. wonder why you need a new one in 6 months??? it really is the best eyelash curler out there. tried other kiinds, even heated ones, and this really does the best job. ",2
I didn't realize what good masacra was until this. It is extremely voluminous and makes my lashes look fluffy. Its an all natural product which i also love. It is not clumpy and comes off extremely easy with gentle soap but doesn't run either. ,0
I didn't really get into lipsticks much until my sister in law mentioned this to me. It's my new favorite part of make up. It feels great on...lasts and lasts and lasts...it rich and hydrating. I don't feel like my lips are drying out while I wear it. Love this shade too.,1
"I didn't really think this would make much of a difference with my skin since my skin is really good, but you can totally see improvement--even if you didn't think you'd be able to. It makes everything so smooth and my skin looks like porcelain. Plus, I think it's fun to put on. And it was a great deal! ",1
"I didn't really understand what this product was when I bought it. I wanted a natural product I could use as a moisureizer around my eyes. I thought the concealer-like effect would be a bonus for daytime. What this really is (as is apparant from the product insert in the package) is a daytime only, under-eye cream. The insert warns against using this on the upper eyelid, and says to use daily, not morning and evening like a regular moisturizer. I've been using it on my fine lines, and for that it's fine, but I still need to find a moisturizer. Won't buy again since I would rather just use one product. ",3
"I didn't regret purchasing this, but I probably won't again. It basically did nothing for my hair plain water couldn't have done. It was definitely refreshing on my face, and I loved it cooled in the refrigerator and then taking it to the beach. Again, water would have done the trick. In fact, that's what I use the bottle for now! ",1
"I didn't see a difference in my hair whatsoever. I had extremely dry hair at the time I tried this, so maybe it's for hair that's already healthy. And I also have really thick hair, so it might be geared towards fine hair. Overall, i can't say I liked it because I didn't notice anything. ",0
"I discovered Hypnotic almost 10 years ago and it remains my favorite. I am very disappointed that I do not see the lotion version available at Sephora anymore. I always prefer lotion becaus ethe scent lasts longer and this particular lotion formula is so extremely moisturizing, it is amazing. L de Lolita Lampika has a similiar mix of sexy, exotic, feminine, but Hyponotic remains supreme.",1
"I discovered Pink Sugar about 3 years ago and I wear it on a regular basis. It smells like vanilla, a little musk, cotton candy. I too like other reviewers been asked time and again what I am wearing by both men and women. There are always people saying ""wow something smells so good"", not realizing it's me and pink sugar. I just smile to myself. My husband loves this fragrance and often buries his face in my neck and hair just to inhale it. I have the eau de toilettes in probably every size and I carry the solid in my purse. Sometimes I can smell it on cardigans and sweaters that I have previously worn and after several days or weeks the smell is still lovely not stinky like some perfumes can turn with time. This fragrance works for an evening out or just going to the grocery store or wearing to work. It is a young fragrance but it is supposed to remind you of childhood not mark you as a child. It's not Loves Baby Soft by any means. Give it a try you will love it. I also recommend Lavanilla pure vanilla fragrance, lighter in scent and little more subtle.",3
"I discovered this perfume at Sephora and I fell in love.\n\nI've noticed that it smells significantly different on each individual.\n\nOn me, it transforms into a beautiful scent that I can only describe as warm and seductive with a touch of lime.\n\nAnother great quality of this Eau de Toilette, is the lasting power.\n\nI spray it on early in the morning after my shower and it lasts until my next morning shower.\n\nIf you are looking for a perfume that will be uniquely yours, give Burberry Brit a try.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.",0
"I discovere this 3 years ago, and nothing even comes close. I'll either mix this with some loose powder, or a tinted moisturizer and I'm ready to go - really diminishes appears of pores, and makes my skin feel smooth and flawless. The SPF is a bonus! ",0
"IDK if I love this Lorac palette like the Best Dressed palette but it is still a very nice palette. Pros 1. The packaging is cute (gray & silver snake skin) 2. Most of the e/s are very soft & go on silky smooth. My favorites from the palette are Serenity, Heavy Metal (which looks a lot like the new MAC starflash Smoke & Diamond e/s), Sapphire Storm & Dreamy. 3. The blush is very pretty (peachy w/gold shimmer, I have no idea why they call this a ""cool"" blush) 4. The palette is a great deal. The e/s are 0.05oz ea (reg Lorac e/s pots are 0.06oz) so they're almost full size & the blush is 0.12oz (reg Lorac blush pots are 0.09oz) so it's actually more product than you'd get in a regular pot Cons 1. Rockstar is chalky 2. The silver glitter in Techno is chunky, the fallout was pretty bad & it was impossible to get off. Overall, it's a very good palette w/a wide range of colors, it's a great value & the pros far outweigh the cons so I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase. ",0
I do a bit of traveling and the sizes in this kit are perfect! I love Laura Mercier and was thrilled to be able to pack the products I love and be able to carry on my bag. I didn't have to give up the things I use to go on a trip. ,3
"I do a lot of outdoor activities and camping and wanted lashes that needed no maintenance. This product goes on without clumps and makes my lashes look great - but natural. The only downside was after I slept in it, I had some dark smudges below my eyes. These were easily cleaned off, and I didn't have to re-apply the mascara. ",3
"I do a lot of work with my hands and during the winter and it gets very rough and dry, regular lotion only work for an hour or so before it go back to being dry. This lotion works amazingly for a long time, I only have to use a tiny amount maybe 2-3 times a day at most. I definitely recommend keeping this small size at your desk or in your purse. It's well worth the money. ",0
"I do like the Dior Concealer. I am 60 and have had dark circles under my eyes since I became and adult. This concealer does lighten them quite a bit. They are not completly gone, but I do think they look much better. I would buy this concealer again. ",4
"I do love Laura Gellar and her products and find them flattering and beautiful. But, this kit did nothing for me. The lip gloss product was not flattering on my skin tone. It is quite bright and pink. The small size Bronze/Brighten looked like talcum powder on my skin. (I have 2 of the large size which work great) I did like the primer which was light and lovely. I also enjoyed the eye/lip primer palette. But, all in all, it was just average to me. ",3
"I do not care for the formulation; this shadow has too much filler and not enough pigment for me. it goes on way too sheer. good for someone who wants a more translucent eyeshadow for a subtle look. has a nice, silky texture, though. ",2
I DO not like this mascara at all! Its clumpy and too thick!!! For the price and its a no go! The only thing i can say is that it lasted forever!!!! I had to completly use it before i bought a differant mascara!!!,1
I do not typically have problems with my shadow staying on but this primer definitely makes shadow last longer and crease less. It also tends to make the color pop a little bit more. Definitely recommend if your shadow doesn't last. ,0
"I do not use the shampoo or conditioner that goes with this product, but I really love this particular product. I use it faithfully once a week - leave it in my hair for about 30 minutes. I'm in my mid-forties and I think my color-treated hair has never looked healthier. ",3
"I don't always wear full-out makeup, but I NEVER go without my Smashbox Photo Finish Light Primer. It is all that it promises to be - lightweight, easily absorbed, decreases shine and helps my powder foundation go on flawlessly. Even my friends have noticed the difference!",1
"I don't feel like this is moisturizing enough for daily use but I took it with me on a recent trip and loved that it was a combination of sunscreen, moisturizer and foundation all in one. It saved me a ton of luggage space! ",0
"I don't feel like this product did anything for my hair. Luckily I only purchased the small travel spray, but it was still $11. For all the wonderful things I have heard about this product, I expected much more. ",1
"I don't have the greatest complextion, so, I'm always up for trying something new. After using this product for awhile, I'm not seeing any change in my skin. Maybe it needs to be used with the other philosophy products to help ""clear"" up any zits. Not loving the results, but do like the light weight texture... ",1
"I dont know about ironless. I think this is excellent for styling with an iron.. and probably good with rollers on the ends of my hair. I believe it protects my shoulder length hair, and leaves it with a lot of movement. My hair needs styling, no matter what. My hair was shiney and i my style stayed.. for 4 days at least! Not a bad price since you need so little. A nice luxury that lasts. ",4
"I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ""FIRMING"" AFFECTS OF THIS, BUT I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD (LIKE A CLEAN/FRESH-COOKIE ALMOND SMELL). IT WORKS GREAT ON DRY ELBOWS & HANDS. I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE SCENTED LOTIONS, BUT I WISH THEY MADE THIS FRAGARENCE IN A SHAMPOO OR EVEN A PARFUME!",2
i don't know how ever lived without this product!! I had always heard great reviews and seen it in the stores but i though just because i had nice skin and my makeup seemed to stay put i didn't really need primer. After getting a sample i was HOOKED-my makeup goes on soooo smooth it looks airbrushed and doesnt crease or settle into fine lines all day. I love too that they have developed different formulas so there is something for everyone. If you havent tried this primer or are debating between primers choose this one!!!,1
"I don't know how it tones/reduces look of pores, but this spray is an essential on the go refresher! It's full of minty essential oils that are energizing and cooling, and makes your skin glow. The smaller size is perfect to pop into your bag when you're traveling--whether abroad or just to work!",1
"I don't know how I've gone all these years without using it. Now, I never wear eye shadow without putting this on first. I have super oily skin & my shadow was always in my crease within an hour. Not any more. I don't know how they do it, but now the shadow stays all day. A little bit of product goes a long way. It's not hard to blend the eye shadow for me (as I've read on some other reviews). I use a medium stiff eye shadow brush to apply with no problems. I really love this product. It's worth every penny. ",2
"I don't know how to describe this scent, but Omnia Crystalline by Bulgari is just fabulous! It is the perfect scent for any woman; it is a light scent, not overpowering, but it lingers nicely. Everytime I wear it, I feel sexy...even if I am going to a meeting or grocery shopping. I may switch scents from time to time, but Omnia Crystalline is always in my beauty cabinet!",1
"I don't know if it extends my color, but it definitely brings out highlights and makes your hair glisten in the sun. I like to use it in combination with the Glossing Cream for the top of my head, since it doesn't weigh the hair by the scalp down like the Glossing Cream can. ",0
"I don't know if it's the actual curler itself, or some magic they put in the curling pad - but this eyelash curler is hands-down the best I have ever used. I only wish they sold replacement pads for it at Sephora - when the pad wears out, I have to buy a whole new curler! :( ",1
"I don't know if this does all that it claims to do, but the truth is it feels refreshing and clean on my face, dries quickly, and helps with headaches. It's a great pick-me-up! If you have the money to spend on something like this, go for it, but there are other products more worth a splurge.",0
"I don't know what it is with this ""expensive"" eye product but no matter how many times I try purchasing the cheaper ones (to save some money), I always miss this one! I'm 50 and don't look it but nevertheless one must moisturize always. I do notice a difference in this product and the cheaper ones out there. I'm not much of an eyeshadow person but I do use undereye concealer and like when it goes on smooth. During the course of my day, I can see the difference between this product and the cheaper ones, BIG TIME! What I have decided to do is just continue to buy this product and settle for a different face moisturizer (Eucerin), which Doctors recommend. Try this product to moisturize the eye area and I bet you will love it too!",3
"I don't k now what Mr. Armani put in Acqua Di Gio, but it's something! I have never met a man that does not smell wonderful in this. It lingers after your guy leaves the room , lasts longer than any other men's fragrance, and in my exposure to it strangely increases the attractiveness of the wearer. It is light, clean and alluring, while leaving a very strong, masculine presence that doesn't overpower you. Acqua Di Gio has this je ne sais quios (French for an attribute you cannot express.) about it that makes it the best men's fragrance around. Plus, it doesn't bother my allergies when worn on my boyfriend, so it's great for allergy sensitive dudes and their dudettes. Acqua Di Gio is a buy that you will not regret!",0
"I don't know why BE or someone hasn't come up with this before but Sephora got the job done! I put my Bare Minerals and Tinted Mineral Veil in this and carry it everywhere - no muss, no fuss, no mess! ",4
"I don't know why it took me so long to try this! Love it. It smells great, not overly coffee, but kind of sweet too. It goes on very nice, not too thick, but enough to feel moisutre. I use it every night before bed and wake up to soft lips! I don't like to dip it in colors, that just didn't work for me, I didn't like the way it felt kind of gritty or looked. I use Buxom by day, and this by night or non-make-up days. ",3
"I don't like the brush applicator and never feel like I have used this product properly. Sometimes too much product comes out and you're kinda stuck with it and have to use your fingers or a sponge. Too messy for me, but the finish does look nice once you're done. ",4
"I don't like to wear a lot of make-up, and Buxom Lips gives just a bit color and shine - and actually lasts! Feels tingly at first, but that goes away in a few minutes. I do not like other Bare Escentuals products, and was hesitant to try this, but received ""Dolly"" as a Sephora sample. I tried it...and loved it!",3
"I don't really know a whole lot about plumpers, so I can't really compare this to others, but my lips really do look fuller when I'm wearing this. It lasts a super long time (3.5 hours if you don't do any eating or drinking!!) and the colors are really pretty. I have Kanani and Dolly. Dolly is kind of a natural pink mauve ish color and kanani is a really pretty pink.",0
"i don't seem to be the only one who wasn't impressed with the stencils, they were all way huge and i have naturally large eyebrows! everything else is great though and the packaging makes it super convenient and very portable ",0
"I don't think its that Bad. I have tried all the newest mascaras that come on the market claiming biggest longest, thickest, etc. I felt this was kind of dry right out of the package, hard to get it to stick to lashes. Color was beautiful though.",3
"I don't think of myself as a finger paints kind of person, but decided to try these for somewthing different. I find myself using them every day. They are light and easy to apply, the colors are perfect for a daytime look. I'm still playing with color combinations. They'll be great for travel too, because the airlines have crumbled some of my favorite powder cakes even when well packed, with their rough handling. These should make it through a flight intact. Flattering soft colors. ",4
"I don't think this smells cheap at all. I think this is a great cologne with a nice scent. Most of the Kenzo line is infinitely wearable; they aren't all phenomenal but you could pick out any without trying them and probably be okay. While it;s true that nothing out about this cologne is unusual, it is a solidly good cologne, true to the woody notes represented by Sephora. If you like Hermes Eau de Terre, you'll probably like this cologne. ",1
"I don't understand all of the hype about this foundation. I found it to be greasy, too unnatural, hard to use and way too expensive for the amount you get. Perhaps it's a good product if you have flawless skin that happens to match one of the 3 shades they offer. I just broke out (really bad) and looked orange.",1
I DON'T USE IT WITH THE SPONGE. I BOUGHT THE AIRBRUSH BRUSH AND IT IS AWESOME. MORE COVERAGE THAN BE BUT LIGHT AND AIRY. I WISH IT CAME IN A DIFFERENT CONTAINER THAT IS MORE CONDUSIVE TO USING THAT FABULOUS BRUSH. ,4
"I don't use this all the time, because it doesn't remove eye makeup very well, but it leaves my face feeling refreshed and soft. It might be a little too gentle, but could be good for someone with skin that is more sensitive than mine. ",0
"I don't usually buy kits anymore but I am glad I purchased this one. The colors are so wearable and the Ruby Radiance All Over Face Color is absolutely gorgeous!! The brushs are outstanding and deliver the perfect amount of color. I just wish the lip polish was more ""red"" than ""mauve"", but it is still very pretty. Don't hesitate! ",3
i dont usually buy shiseido products but i went out on a limb for this one it is absolutely amazzzzing i use it everyday as my only foundation i have red discoloration and it covers everything exelently ,0
"I don't usually like any kind of lip product in a pot. They're messy, kinda gross, and rarely work well. This one was different. My favorite thing about this balm is that the container has a rounded edge unlike most other pots. It allows you to smoothly grab product without the edge scraping it off and making a mess.\n\nThe flavor & scent are great. It's perfect for a balm. You don't have to worry about kissing pets or humans! The tint is perfect for wearing with or without makeup, around the house, running errands, work, or dinner out even.\n\nIt works decently, but nothing magical or extraordinary. I would buy it again, but only to hold me over while I search for a balm a little more fabulous. I wish they'd make it in a tube with a wand!",1
I don't usually like pot blushes but this one intrigued me with the title. I liked it fine but found it hard to get out of the pot with my nails getting in the way so I discovered a great way to apply. I used a blush brush and kinda dabbed it into the pot and then brushed it back and forth on my cheeks. FABULOUS! It imparted a greatly natural looking blush and I was able to put it where I needed it. ,4
"I don't want to bring down this highly rated primer, but it didnt do anything for my skin. It made my skin feel greasy for the entire day after putting it on and to top it off my foundation didnt look even a tiny bit more smooth. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because it might work better on dry/normal skin as opposed to my combo/oily.",0
"I DO recommend this lip gloss, although it is such a high-gloss formula that it can be a bit sticky. [in truth, almost every lip gloss can be described as 'a little sticky.'] HOWEVER, the colors are amazing, and the product wears very, very well for a lipgloss. I make sure to use a lip liner- I recommend Make Up For Ever's Aqua Lip pencil- which I blend slightly into the Cyber Lip color. [don't be afraid of the blue or other bright hues. they go on translucently and are lovely.] after I apply Aucoin's gloss to my lined lips- sparingly: the colors are very concentrated- I seal the edges of my lip line with a lipstick sealer. Sephora makes a good one. I do NOT put the sealer all over the lip product- this would start an unfortunate 'texture war.' instead, I paint the sealer over the lipliner and a TINY bit beyond, which acts as a barrier for the gloss. you can increase the wear time of any high-gloss lip product using this technique. so, I will continue to buy Kevyn Aucoin Cyber Lip for the dazzling colors. they have a perfect amount of sparkle, and are never garish. don't be put off by the price, because these glosses are concentrated in formula, and will out-last your other glosses. I wear them when I want a special 'glam' boost to my look. ",2
"I drink tea and an occasional soda. My teeth show my age. I look younger than my age, except for the stains and color of my teeth. So when others talk about dying their hair for job interviews, I think about tooth whitening. I chose this product because it came so highly recommended. After using it for the prescribed 7 days, I was disappointed because Go Smile lighted the overall color only slightly and it had no affect on two stains. ",4
"I ended up ordering this on-line since my local Sephora store was sold out the first day it hit the store! I love all the Bare Escentuals makeup, but find their regular eye shadows a bit muted. NOT THIS BABY! The colors are phenomenal - I have green eyes, and the gray/black combination really makes them stand out. I use the black glitter shadow wet as liner and also in the crease. It truly is a ""Rocker"" eye look! ",3
I ended up returning this. I felt for what it did it wasn't worth the price. I've used cheaper plumpers that did the same. This made my lips tingle and i liked that but it went away quickly and didnt really do more than other plumpers i had to my lips. just more of the tingle. ,2
I enjoyed this little sampler. I wish I could find a few shadows without the glitter--but I adore BE shadows so much I stick with only theirs. I loved this because I can add a hint of color and blend it and VIOLA a new look! Turned my blah routine into a fun new approach! ,2
"I enjoy lip plumpers and this one works well, but it was almost too sting-y for my taste. IF you make the mistake of getting this outside of your natural lipline, you'll temporarily have a red, tingly spot to remind you to be more careful next time! ",2
"I enjoy using this before I turn in at night. I like the light scent and smooth, creamy texture. It does a good job of moisturizing my hands, but I'd prefer using something with more anti-aging properties. ",3
"I expected this kit to work wonders with my long, Asian hair. Unfortunately, it performed similar to drug store brands. My hair was hard to comb and when dried, it looked a little frizzy and heavy. Adding the oil as a leave-in did help tame the fly-aways. The smell was nice, but the price is a little high for the lack of results. ",3
"I eyelashes are thin, these give me big beautiful eyes. they go on easily, they're easy to adapt to my eyes and the adhesive holds! I have fallen asleep with these lashes on and the next mornig the glue was still holding strong. I suggest that you use a good quality eye make-up remover to remove these lashes ",3
"I Fall in love with it the first time I smell it, it's convenient for winter. Strong and heavy but luxurous, sexy seductive, sensual fragrance. I've been stopped everywhere (work, street, mall) asking what I am wearing! a must have!",1
"If BE would change to a sponge applicator instead of the brush this product has I'd have given it another star. I like the color I got (Sophia) but it was difficult to apply evenly with the brush. Also, the sheen took away from the lovely color which is why I bought it in the first place. ",4
"I feel qualified to give my opinion, as I am a lipgloss addict. These are the absolute BEST glosses ever. All four colors are gorgeous, and the staying power is quite impressive for a gloss. Even when your lips feel completely un-sticky after several hours, the color and sparkles are still there. The tingle effect is great. I don't know that it really plumps the lips, but the high-shine and sparkles (not to be confused with shimmer) give the lips a fuller appearance. I was looking for another Buxom gloss that gave a similar effect as my Dominique Busom gloss. These have what I was looking for, and more. I am also a fan of the ""brush type"" applicator (rather than the awkward slanted sponge-type), and these have the brush. It's easier to get full coverage and to apply it more precisely. They are also a GREAT value. These glosses are perfectly purse or pocket sized, and last a long time, since a little goes a long way. You will not be disappointed! ",1
"I feel so soft and sexy after using this product. It quenched all my dry patches, like the heel and knees. Gave my skin a dewy glow and the intoxicating fragrance. Made me irresistible to my husband. I would have given it five stars but it is greasy so use sparingly. ",1
"I feel that Bare Escentuals , Well Cared For, is the most luxurious shampoo a brush could ever want.I would use it on my own hair, that is how great it is. My brushes come out so soft and shiny after I use the moisturizing shampoo, and they are so clean, which is essential when you are constantly using a mineral powder based makeup. It really gets deep down into the bristles and gets all the excess makeup out of them. I know I could just use my own shampoo, but I feel that this product is worth buying and using on my brushes to keep them in the best condition possible. ",3
"I feel this product does a good job protecting from wetness and odor, although I don't feel it lasts all day. I'm pleased with it's no-irritation formula and it doesn't stain my clothes. I've been using it for about a month, and so far I have not seen the ""brightening affect"", but after reading other reviews, it looks like I need to be patient. Also, I really wish this didn't cost so much money! So, the long and the short of it...I'm really on the fence with the pros and cons!",1
"I fell in LOVE! I loved having a nice purse size with all I needed for my day. OOh la lift brightens nicely, love the highbeam for a dewey glow. The Boing and Lemon-aide are great and I use them together nicely. The lip plump doesn't puff your lips but does let you believably cheat your lipline and have your color stay great! I now refill this from full sizes and continue to carry with me. LOV IT ",4
"I fell in love with the shape of the brushes and how they contour your brows perfectly. You can lighten the color by applying it softly, or you can make it darker by adding more brow powder. Definitely an essential to me! ",0
"I fell in love with this mascara the 1st time I tried it. I'ts not clumpy like a lot of mascaras, and it doesn't smear or run during the day, which is a problem I always have with others. It looks so natural! I Love It!",1
"I fell in love with this shade. The lipstick is luxurious. It makes my lips feel so pampered. The color is the best for summertime. I wear it whenever I feel like being extra flirty, or just want to hang out by the pool. ",2
"I felt I had a lot more control with this eyelash curler than others I have tried. Curls easily and as much or as little as I want. They tell me there is no difference between this one and the metal one, but I swear this one worked better for me. ",2
"I felt in love with the clutch! The design is so beautiful and elegant! You can take out the make-up and use the clutch for other things. And, as always, YSL's eye shadows are superb. The powder is fine and soft, and the colors are very vibrant (The shadow can be both day and night looks, depending on how you use them). I also liked the pink lipstick since it gives off a great baby doll color (the payoff is 2 shades lighter than pictured). However, I did not find the lip gloss very useful. It is not really that glossy/shiny, and it is very hard-you can barely scoop out a tiny bit. Overall, I am satisfied. ",0
I felt like a new women. My body was soft and silky. I had my daughters begging to use the soap. I am buying the soap as a Christmas for my girlfriends and daughters. I also found out my husband was using this great soap. OMG,3
"I felt like I wanted to wipe my face off all day long!! I've never used so many blotting papers in one day! Gave it to a friend that didn't like it either. Maybe if you have dry skin, but my skin is oily & I live in FL so maybe that was just a bad combination.",1
"I finally ""bit the bullet"" and bought a concealer that really works. After using inexpensive concealers that didn't conceal, and ran if my eyes watered, I am very happy with this one. I use without a brush which works fine.",4
I finally found a mascara that doesn't straighten mt eyelashes after I curl them! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's so darn hard to get it all off. This doesn't stop me from using it. ,4
"I find myself constantly searching for the perfect blush,and after reading all the fantastic reviews for this blush, i decided to try it. So pigmented and soooo beautiful.comes in great shades. This blush is sure to please.",0
"I find myself reaching for the beat every day. It seems to me like a very homey fragrance. Not as much fresh, but more sweet and delicate, but somehow, it finds a way to be perky and upbeat. A fan favorite. one of Burberry's best. ",0
"I find that this product is extremely helpful with under eye circles. I use my middle finger to pat on and gently blend just the little amount I need, and I like to use Bare Escentuals concealer powder over that. I use the BE concealer brush and pat on a very small amount of powder. This sets the ""calk"" concealer and provides excellent coverage that won't budge until you take them off. (I've got pretty dark circles). I think that once you've found the right colors to use, this trick may be helpful. I use light Calk with BE ""Summer"" multi-tasking concealer powder. If this sounds like a lot to spend; rest assured, both products really last a very long time. Only 4 stars because the sponge is pretty much useless as far as I'm concerned, but thank goodness for the sharpener. ",3
"I find that this product only did half the job. When I used the products, it did make my hair look thicker but the results are not permanet like the description suggests. As soon as you run out of product and wash your hair just once with something else, you are right back where you started. I found that just using the spray and/or cream after washing my hair with my regular shampoo worked just as well. Also, using the sampoo made my hair not only appear thicker but frizzier as well. All in all, I say save your money. ",0
"I find the Frederick Fekkai line of products to all be wonderful. This one rates right up there with the others that I have used. The scent is not sweet, but it is all natural, therefore - has that very fresh scent, which I like too. Makes your hair very soft and shiny. ",3
"I find these daily pads a little too intensive to use on a daily basis on my dry, acne prone skin. I use these about 3X a week, and my skin tolerates them just fine. Overall, they help keep my skin smoother with a better tone and smaller pores. ",4
"I find this little atomizer sturdy and easy to use. You can buy a non spray fragrance, pour into the little glass vial protected by the metal case, and you're good to go. It is true that you have to be careful unscrewing the glass vial which is the reaosn for the 4 rating. ",4
"I first bought Smoky Eyes and had so much fun with that, decided to check out the one for Brown Eyes next. This is such a versatile product -- you can do so many things -- keep it simple and summer-sheer -- or add drama by layering on more color. The only problem is that you have to remember to tap off your brush before applying -- esp. the darker shades, as the powder tends to drop down under your eyes, on your nose, etc. be sure and do a quick check before you go! ",4
"I first bought this lipstick on a whim. This is the second purchase. I actually used a whole tube. That is a first for me. I've got 3 tubes and LOVE them. Candy Store, Raisin Cane & Ruby Vibes. The colors are true and are sheer or easily buildable. This lipstick feels great on your lips, not sticky or thick. The little bit of sparkle or glitter is perfect too. And the little ""beauty fortunes"" are so cute. AND who could resist when my name is LANA too!!!! ",2
"I first bought this perfume several years ago after first getting a sample. After trying the sample, I couldn't stop smelling it, I found it simply addictive. And now, after using it for years, I still feel the same way. It's very feminine - without being too floral or fruity. It's a little on the heavy side, so I use it mostly in the fall and winter. If you plan on getting this, get the lotion too - it's the same scent but a little lighter, and the lotion itself is light and makes your skin so soft!",0
i first discovered the waterproof eye pencil and was using my old pencil sharpener..which was bad anyways. I didn't realize that I had a bad sharpener until I decided to give this one a try. I was dissappointed that the pencil was so dull and not sharp and was blaming it on the pencil not the sharperner. It truly makes a world of a difference. ,1
"I first discovered this body wash, shampoo, etc. at a friend's house and fell in love. If you like margaritas, this is the product for you. It lathers up and leaves your skin fresh and smooth - with a slight hint of margarita to it. I've also used it as a shampoo (just to give it a whirl) and found that it did a great job. This is a MUST BUY and always on my gift list now.",2
"i first got this as a gift and was reluctant to use it. well, that was dumb! i don't know what i waited for! it has a light, fun, totally girly (without the frilliness) fragrance and feels downright silky on the skin.",2
"I first got this as a sample a then had to get it. What a great color. Goes on perfectly smooth, has great shimmer, and lasts a long time. Slender case will fit into any pocket too!! Good job Sephora!! ",2
"I first got this sample from Sephora back in 2007. I loved it then, and remembered everything about it. I had to have it at all costs, but could never get around to buying it.\n\nI finally saw it again after so much time at a place called Anthropologie in San Fran. It invoked such a miraculous feeling I knew I had to have it. Since they were out the next time I went back, I bought it here from Sephora.\n\nIt is one of my all time favorite perfumes, and always will be. It has a divine essence that is both lovely and timeless. Tocca hit the jackpot with this heavenly floral scent, and I hope that everyone who comes to buy it, gets the same satisfaction I do every time I put it on.",0
I first purchased this is San Fran several years ago. Liked the color and consistency sooo much I ordered it online to get it. Not in my local store. I think the shade moght be universally lovely on everyone. ,4
"I first purchased this item in the small travel size to try it out. I found my self using it all the time, especially when going out! It leaves your hair so shinny and soft, and it smells pretty good. I sprayed some on my sister once while doing her hair and she fell in love with it too! Now neither of us can do without! ",0
"I first read about this blush in allure magazine a few years ago, upon purchasing the 1st day I wore I received compliments and I have used it ever since, its the perfect color and I even have purchased the cream stick formula because I like it so much.",3
I first read about this in a fashion magazine. It really feels nice on my face and seems to help the makeup go on smooth. I mix it with Clinique skin tone cream. The combo is very light oil free scent free. ,3
"I first received as a holiday gift in 2006; the cinnamon fragrance is warming and inviting. I love that the product is both body wash and shampoo so convenient to take on trips or to the gym (or in the case of the bottle received as gift - to the showers at my husband's office as that Christmas our plumbing failed and required 3 weeks repair). The wonderful cinnamon scent kept my spirits up as we made do with offsite showers. Since the gift I've bought several ""refills"".",3
I first received this lipstick as a sample and loved the feel & color...so much that I had to buy the full size. It goes on smooth and doesn't come off on my glass. The color is absolutely amazing. This might make me wear lipstick every day and not just special occasions. ,2
"I first saw the Nars shadow in Silent Night in a Sephora ad. I was struck by the richness of the golden color, and I was not disappointed when I tried it. It really gave sparkle and shine to my eyes without being too sparkly. It is the perfect eye make-up for the holiday season. ",4
I first smelled the version for men. I had a neighbor who wore this cologne every day and all the women loved it when he walked past. I tried the perfume for myself and I love it. It is my all time favorite scent. I also have a summer version that smells out of this world also. This is a must buy.,2
"I first smelled this fun, stylish fragrance as a sample with a Sephora purchase..and I was hooked! I saved it to use for only special occasions until I was lucky enough to realize I could actually order an entire bottle online...Imagine that! Wearing this always brightens my day! Lllove it!!!!!",1
"I first smelled this scent in a fresh store in NYC. I really liked the perfume but wasn't ready to commit to the purchase. When I saw this at Sephora I was excited, but extremely disappointed when it arrived. I disliked the smell enough to return it. I would test first in the store if you have never experienced the scent. ",1
I first tried the samples and then ordered the collection. I love the lip glosses but find that they are too runny (should be in a tube). Love the blush )a very subtle color that would look good on anyone. I'm just ok with the powder. Wasnt fond of the mascara (no thickener) and really liked the tinted primer. Would make a great gift for a friend. ,3
"I first tried the shadows in a kit. Smashbox is showing only a few combos here and now, but their range of seasonal colors is astounding. Plus, the neutrals look smashing with the vibrantly colored cream eye liners for a sort of "" reverse color"" look- neutral eye with stand out liner. I love it!! The combo with pink, gray and black is identical in shade tones to the now-discontinued BE "" Renegade Chic"" smoky eye kit, which I love on special occasions. I adore the warm neutrals for every day use, and the "" featured"" seasonal collections can't be beat for the latest in eye shadow colors. I have never had a problem with the product quality in the container, or on my eyes either. These shadows work extremely well with Smashbox's cream eye liner palettes with some vibrant hues as well as more traditional shades. ",3
"I first tried this when given a sample at the Benefit counter, and I instantly fell in love with it. It smells fantastic (I love that it contains natural ingredients - the idea of ""breakfast for your face"" is great), and exfoliates my skin wonderfully while being gentle enough not to irritate (I use it a few times week - every day would be too much). Once you rub it in, leaving it on gives skin a wonderfully tingly feeling. A+++! ",1
"I first used it when I got a free sample, and really liked it. I figured with long-term use it would make my skin look so much better. Unfortunately, like most products, it is just a temporary fix. It is rather pricey for the six vials, which will probably only last a couple of months. I find the results fair, yet better than many products I have used. Will I buy it again? I'm not sure! ",4
"I first walked up to a cosmetics counter asking for concealer for my dark undereye circles when I was in junior high. Since then, I have tried a lot of products. Now that I am older, I also have some brown spots I wish to minimize. At first, I thought this concealer would be too light to provide the coverage I need, but I have found it conceals and highlights very naturally, which is great for my fair skin. I like a natural look. ",2
"If it were just me I would rate this as 4 stars since it is a ""plain"" scent but my Dial soap-using boyfriend LOVES this too. He even admits his skin is much less dry since using this product. AND he smells sooo good!\nIt's hard to go wrong with Philosophy and their fun ""flavors""",2
"I found a decent set of ""waterproof"" liners! I took a long shower with this stuff on and not even a smudge appeared; A testament to their waterproof-ness. The white liner is also great as a highlighter for brow bones, cheek bones, nose... etc. They go on easily with no tugging or skipping, the colors are outstanding, they are long wearing and a GREAT deal! Grab these up before they quit selling them! ",1
"I found that Nars has the most natural looking blush out there! It applies wonderful, blends with foundation perfect, lasts long, and gives a great highlight of color to the cheeks. A definate must have!!",2
"I found that this kit saved me a LOT of money. Because I love Hope in a Jar so much, I find that I spend more money on this than anything else. When I found this kit, I was thrilled to be able to try the serum, eye cream and exfolliant as well...with the awesome cleanser, Purity Made Simple, which literally lasts forever. Wonderful, excellent kit! ",2
I found the miracle product. I have never had complements about how great my make-up was until I started using Smashbox. I've told my friends and NOW they are using the product. One word describes it- AWESOME! ,3
"I found this brush to be too rough on my sometimes sensitive skin...I exchanged it for the Angled Face Brush and I love that one much more, and they do the same job in terms of getting the Bare Mineral powders on my face.",0
I found this by chance looking online for a reasonabley priced bronzer before vaca. Once I tried it on I loved it!! I purchased the zebtra safari since my complection is more olive toned. You get what you pay for and this was worth the bargain. Blends great and depending on your brush you can control the amount of coverage you want. ,1
"I found this facial wash gentle, yet effective in removing makeup and not leaving my sensitive skin temporarily red, which so often happens with othe products. You may need 2 applications to fully remove eye makeup. I'll definitely buy again.",4
"If Philosophy ever goes out of business.... I will be buying a lifetime supply of this cleanser for myself and my future daughters! it's simply the best... never irritates or dries out, but always leaves your skin (even with a full face of makeup!) clean!",0
If red is your deal this color is for real. It is beautiful and applies effortlessly It is a blue-red and when used with a lip pencil has some staying power. The case is glorious and I love pulling it out of my purse to use. You will not be disappointed. ,4
"If the brush that came with the sample kit is the same brush as this one, which I think it is, this is an inferior quality brush, not soft at all (but it is natural hair, if that's what you want). I have a Kabuki brush and a Baby Buki from another company that are far superior to this, very soft (synthetic so no allergy issues), and less expensive to boot. ",4
"If this concealer is supposed to be on the solid end of the creamy spectrum, then I really like it. For once, I have total control of how much and exactly where this concealer is applied. For once I don't have to worry about squeezing too much out of the tube and wasting an expensive product. For once, I believe I'm getting great under-eye and on-the-dot blemish coverage. ",1
"If you already have a fave mascara, but, sometimes dreams about what else is out there...The Lash Stash is perfect for you!!! The practicle idea for the girl who's timid of trying something new, because, of the full size price. For the price of a standard mascara you get 10 different brands, that range from glossy,waterresistant,thickening, etc. Each tube has several uses(up to a week for some) so you have a few days to see if it's right for you. If not, toss it...love it,put it aside for later purchase. Bottom line...this is a great idea for a great price!!! Thanks, Sephora!!! P.S. I am in love right now with Urban Decays Big Fatty mascara!!!:) Cool packaging, too! ",2
"If you are an ""on the go"" girl like me, this is the foundation for you. I usually apply with a ""Z"" motion over my face to cover my whole face. A bottle usually lasts me about 40-60 days. It's a little pricey, but totally worth it. The finish is flawless and I always get compliments on it!",0
"If you are expecting to go from ho-hum to Angelina Jolie lips, you're probably doomed to be disappointed by any lip plumping product. But if you want a bit more fullness to soften the lines on your lips and make them look a little younger/smoother, I recommend LipFusion Color Shine. I use the clear every day, and also apply it just before bedtime. I also have a couple of the colors, and they're great. They keep my lips moist and smooth, with or without lipstick. (I love the Plump and Re-Plump even more, but unfortunately the color selection is very limited.) I have very sensitive skin, but I never found this product to sting or even tingle. (Each person's sensitivity is different, so your mileage may vary.) :) ",3
"If you are looking for a light, crisp scent you must try this parfum. It is refreshing and smells clean. I undershtand it is a limited offering, but I wish Burberry would make it a permanent scent in their product line. It is wonderful. ",4
If you are looking for an ANTIPERSPIRANT this is not your pick - it is a deoderant like it says on the label.\nSmells just like the perfect perfume - not too strong.\nI just don't like the sticky feeling I have after applying and throughout the day. I will probably try the SUGAR deoderant after finished with this one.,0
If you are looking for a smooth-as-silk foundation Korres Ginger & Vitamis foundation is the answer! I have used it alone when I want my skin to look natural and I have also applied it as a light base under a concealer. My skin has never looked so fresh and bright. ,3
"If you are looking for that healthy flush, this product is the one. Easy to apply, doesn't dry out. Loved it so much, I bought most of the colors and it lasts. Even if you eat something oily, you can still see a trace. Feels like nothing on, apply a little gloss on top and you are ready to face the world. ",2
"If you are over 40, this is for you! The Purity cleanser removes every trace of makeup but leaves your skin comfortable and soft. The booster serum mixed with one or two booster caps at night will give your skin a smoothness and clarity you haven't seen in at least a decade - I'm happily addicted to these 2 products! The eye cream and Hope in a Jar moisturizer will hydrate and soften your skin and reduce the signs of aging. This kit is the perfect way to test the water, so to speak, or to have a nice travel kit on hand for Philosophy veterans like me! ",3
"If you are tired of oily bi-phase removers, try this one! It will take off waterproof mascaras and anything else (maybe take a couple tries for the uber-proof ones) but it leaves you feeling fresh and clean afterwards ",1
"If you color your hair, you will love this product! The shampoo and conditioner pair well together, and have a nice citrus scent without being too overpowering. A few drops of the glaze on your hands, rub together, and smooth over your dry hair and voila, your frizzies are gone. The hairspray has nice hold without being too sticky. The comb is a nice add-in, too. I love this set. ",1
"...if you do not yet own a pair of Tweezerman tweezers, you are doing your brows a tremendous disservice. :) This product is absolutely worth every penny - no tweezers perform better. Plus - you can send them back to the factory for FREE sharpening for the life of the tweezers (I think you pay the $5 for S&H). You can't beat that! ",1
"If you don't have time to wash your hair, this product will help in a pinch. Smells fresh. Sometimes too much product comes out and it is hard to get it out of your hair. I have tried similar products that I like better. ",4
"If you don't know much about shaping this brows, consider this a 101...it is such an awesome ""learn how to"" kit for the brows. I used mine religiously for about a year and then no longer needed the stencils because i had a great feel for how to shape them. It's pricey, but if you're looking to save a trip to the professional, it'll save you money in the long run. ",1
"If you don't own a make-up brush, you need this one. This is the best way keep your hands clean while applying your foundation and it also wastes less. It prevents you from putting on thick coats of foundation and distributing in a way where you will get the natural smooth feel. ",0
"If you enjoy sweet fragrances, you'll love this alluring combo of vanilla and caramel. I've never received so many compliments on a fragrance before - and it's very reasonably-priced for an everyday indulgence.",1
"If you go to lots of parties where you want to have that extra sparkle in your hair, this is the way to go! It's about as classy as sparkly hair can get, but personally, I just don't have lots of places to use it. ",0
"If you have fine limp hair, this does the trick - as someone who washes their hair everyday most Full Volume Shampoo's only work after the first day, this one just keeps on giving that fullness we all want!! Great!!! ",4
"If you have large pores and sensitive skin, this may not be the product for you. My face broke out and the coverage wasn't terrific. I liked that it wasn't a super heavy feeling on my face, but the constant brushing to get the right amount of coverage irritated my skin. I followed the DVD instructions to the letter...so that was a little disappointing. The price made it worthwhile to at least check it out. ",3
"if you have oily hair and is concerned with product buildup but your hair is dull, this is the product! obviously creamy products weren't meant for oily hair so i was glad when fakkai came up with this product. i just throw it in my bag and if my hair seems dull i just spray it once on both sides of my head as far away from my scalp as possible lol and it's a life saver! i love it. ",0
"If you have very oily skin and tend to break out, this primer is for you! I personally am not looking for a heavy product to be on my extremely oily skin and this goes on smooth and keeps my Natural Performance foundation in place. I put my moisterizer on first, and yes oily skin needs moister too, then I put the aquaPrime on, let it dry...I put a loose mineral powder on then I put my foundation on. Best primer in my opinion if you want light and without silicone to clog pores! ",3
"If you like a clean, pleasant, not overwhelming scent..this is the best of them...I usually get tired of fragrances, but this one has seemed to remain one of my favorites for a while....it's great for everyday..I can't get enough of it...and I get soooo many complements when I wear it....",0
"If you like shine, this is your shadow! I love BE shadows but I'm older and am getting a bit of the ""crepey"" problem on my eyelids. This pigment is definitely for the younger girls but it is gorgeous! The instructions are terrific and easy to follow. I rated this kit as only Average because I really can't wear it often at my age. ",4
"If you like the full size Buki, then the Baby Buki is a must have for your makeup bag or purse. It provides even coverage and is fairly soft, just like the original. It doesn't work quite as well as the full size, but is useful to have to go. ",0
"If you love Bare Escentials and love the brushes, you can't afford to be without this cleanser. This is a gentle, conditioning brush shampoo and leaves the brushes soft and clean. I have brushes from many cosmetic companies and the Bare Escentials brushes are the best and worth taking care of.. ",4
"If you love ""clean smelling"" without the hint of anything, then you will love this. I don't think fruits smell clean. Pure Grace avoids smelling fruity at all. It honestly smells like clean, plain and simple.",2
"If you love this brand, this kit is a great value and a great way to start using these products. I love everything that comes in the kit although I like to buy a different color now that I have got started since I am super fair. ",0
If you pluck your brows then these are a must have. I had 10 pair of tweezers that went in the trash as soon as these babies came in the mail! They have a wonderful pin point that allows you to be exact when plucking!!! Every woman must own a pair or two. ,2
"If you're like me, with a skin/bath/hair product graveyard under your bathroom sink, you try new products with low expectations. For once, I got my money's worth and more - this moisturizer blew me away! The first application made a huge difference. Even using other oil-absorbing gels/lotions for my face, I'm usually shiny by lunchtime and slick by dinner. I applied this in the morning post-shower and was still soft and shine-free after dinner. After using it for a couple of weeks, my pores look smaller and I have had zero blemishes. So THIS is what it feels like to have good skin.... ",1
"If you're looking for a great all natural cleanser that really CLEANS, look no further. I love Boscia's products and think that they are really effective without using a lot of the chemicals most cleansers use. I do prefer milk cleansers because of my sensitive skin, but sometimes you just want a good foamy cleanse...and this is perfect.",1
"If you're looking for something that's not floral, not spicy, not powdery, not fruity, but smells phenomenal and makes your spirit soar, this is the fragrance for you!! I get so many compliments--people just love to smell me!! ",2
"If you're one of the few who has an extra $60 lying around, get this. It's so worth it. I'm about to get mine, and I can't believe how great this is. Four award-winning NARS products for just $60 - it's a no-brainer! ",0
If you rub this product between your fingers it actually feels mosturizing. I have dry skin and love ths powder. I had been using clinique and think this is softer. I was concerned about the color but should not have been as it really is transparent. ,3
"If you've never tried Urban Decay's eyeshadow, you've been missing out. These colors are FANTASTIC: bold, colorful and are excellent quality!!!! In the lower-medium price range but definitely worth it!! Don't give it a second thought!! ",0
"If you want a fresh, non-greasy, powdery light, long-lasting foundation, this is for you! I use the color Buff (4) because I have light skin. It matches perfectly, Looks like I am not wearing any foundation! Very light feeling, but lasts all day at work and after! Wonderful! ",3
"If you want a guys attention, wear this perfume. Every time I would walk in to the employee lounge at my job. I would get at least one, ""You smell really good"" or something of that nature. This scent if playful and fun, gives a childish feel to yourself. And hey who doesn't love feeling like a kid again.",0
"If you want a plumper that really has some bite, this is for you! I asked the salesperson for a plumper that really had some zest. I have thin lips and wanted something to use during the day. I have used DuWop Venom and others with the oils to stimulate circulation, but hadn't noticed a difference. PUMP'EM UP really does sting and you don't need any color because your lips will flush. You sensitive types may want to steer clear of this one. I would give it 5stars but it does dry out my lips a little. ",1
"If you want a stiff hairspray, this is not for you. It has holding power but is light. The only problem is that it does not last all day. After about 5 hours, more should be applied.Unfortunately, I am not in an environment where I can do that. ",4
"If you want lashes that separate piee by piece this is the mascara to have. Great for doing the lower lashes in one swoop. Not gunky and chalky looking on the lashes. I do wish that the wand was a little wider to cover quicker, other that that it is the best mascara I have ever tried and I have tried them all I believe ",1
"If you want something that makes you look like you are wearing fake lashes, this is not for you. I like that it makes my lashes look nice and full without looking like I'm even wearing mascara. I personally don't like to look like I'm wearing make-up, so it's perfect for me. If you also like the natural look you will like this product. ",2
"If you want that perfect shade for everyone without the glimmer, give the Amour shade a try. The photos make this look overly pink. It gives you a very natural looking blush. It is a perfectly natural looking shade that I think would be good for almost any skin tone. I only knock it one star as I find it does not last throughout my 8 hour work day without requiring reapplication.",3
"I gave this a 3 star and will be returning it back to the store for a few reasons. It does not give me enough moisturizing, I got the light color and it makes my face look rather yellow, and it also leaves patches all over my face. ",0
"I gave this as a gift and was very dissapointed to find that the ""full size"" bottle you get from the certificate is only a 1 oz size or less. You could buy the large bottle for only a few more dollars and skip the sampler. My friend only liked 1 of the ten samples. ",1
I gave this as a gift at my office. The recipient was thrilled and mentioned several times how much she is enjoying it. How can you go wrong with Philosophy? A gift of Philosophy is always right. I am gifting a lot of Philosophy products this year -- from my 20 year old granddaughter to my 80-something mother in law. ,3
I gave this mascara a fair chance and I have decided not to get it again. For the price it dries out way to quickly. I don't use mascara all the time and there is plenty left in there but it dried up and got super clumpy after only a month. I don't pump it either because I know that makes it dry out quicker. I kept thinking it was me but friends of mine are having the same problem. It great if you can afford $25 every month for mascara because it is wonderful when it's new. I had the same problem with the waterproof. ,0
I gave this product to my very dear friend as a gift. I was concerned because the color looks very intense in the tube. I shouldn't have been it gave her lips a very light tint and she loved the product. The package it comes in is adorable. ,2
I gave this to a friend for Christmas and she just raved about it. She said she was going to purchase the products again. This is a nice way for someone to sample all the products to see which ones they like. ,4
"I gave this to my best friend as a gift and she absolutely loved it. And so did her husband, she mentioned with a smile and a wink. She loved the scent and found it wonderfully moisturizing, and I'm so glad she was so happy with it. ",3
"I generally love Tarte products, but this mascara is less than a 'meh'. No matter how I try my lashes are stiff and clumped together, hard to separate. It both flakes off during the day, and smears when you cry or wash your face. ",4
"I get more attention and comments from this perfume - it's my favorite! My fiance' instantly tells me how good I smell the moment I put it on. Plus, the bottle makes me feel like a princess in a fairy tale. ",1
"I get occasional adult acne, one (or two blemishes at the most) at a time. I've tried SO many products. This is the ONE. It's light weight and can be worn under makeup so you don't have to wait til night to treat a spot. I have been amazed at the speed with which it heals a blemish compared to other products. Non-drying and not irritating, which I truly appreciate. ",4
"I get really bad skin bumps and this lotion is the only thing that has ever made a difference after using it. The bumps haven't yet completely disapeared but I'd say an 75% improvement is for sure. Just started ussing the KP exfoiliator, hopefully that will make the bumps go away completely. I'd recommend the product highly, worth the money.",1
"I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume....and it's true, the warmer you are the stronger the scent gets but in no way overbearing. I love it...intoxicating. I have worn it for a few years now and will keep purchasing it.",1
"I get tired of makeup colors pretty quickly, so it's rare that a color product makes it onto my ""will purchase again"" list. This blush is on my ""will purchase again, and again, and again"" list. The color is so natural on my fair skin... sometimes I just use a tinted moisturizer and a dash of this on my cheeks to achieve that rosy, dewy ""no-makeup"" look. I use it nearly every day. This is one product that actually lives up to the hype.",1
"I give this perfume 5 stars. The price is resonable, the scent is just amazing. It last all day long and it doesn't take much. The smell of ginger really pops in this fragrance! I have had compliments and questions where can they find this perfume. Just think my addiction to this Pink Sugar started with just a sample. Try it, and I promise you too will be hooked.",2
"I give this scent credit where it's due. It smells exactly like it says it does. The two things I noticed most were the strong candy smell and the vanilla. Unfortunately, I think that stinks! At first it's not bad, but the longer you wear it the more the sweetness tends to give you a headache. If you hear ""cotton candy"" and want to smell like that - you'll love this. Otherwise stay away!",0
"I got a free sample of this and tried it, and LOVED it. while it didn't hide my pores, it DID reduce how much oil i showed throughout the day. Surprising, because i have super oily skin. I was really surprised by how light it was, when i first opened it, it was tinted darker than me, but i put it out, and it felt more like a cream turn powder. Don't use a lot though, just a small amount goes a long way. It might not feel like you put any on, or its rubbing off, but it's there, and it DOES mattify like nothing else on the market! Worth a shot, ask for a sample.",0
I got a sample of the face cleanser with my purchase. I used it this morning and I love the way it made my face feel. My face felt very smooth and soft. I also like that you can use it on your eyes. Many of the facial cleansers out there dry out your eye area even if you are trying to avoid the area. I will definately purchase the full size.,1
"I got a sample of this for my birthday last year and I fell in love with it. I have always had cracked heels, but after a couple of uses my heels were soft and smooth. It is a super rich cream. I'm in love with this body butter. ",0
I got a sample of this fragrance with another purchase and went crazy over the smell. My husband absolutely adores and bought the gift set for me for Christmas. I couldn't wait to try the lotion. It's so silky and the scent stays with you so much longer when you layer. The greatest frangrance I have ever experienced! ,3
"I got a sample of this from an earlier purchase and loved the way it soothed my achy feet. It moisturizes, smells wonderful, and refreshes and stimulates my feet. It's the best foot product I've ever used!",3
I got a sample of this last time I was at Sephora and I love it! I have to force myself to finish my Dior before I go buy this. I love the small brush and how I can get almost every lash without getting product all over. The lengthening is really great although I wish it gave a teensy bit more volume but overall I really like it (I also like how it does not stink) ,0
"I got a sample of this lip gloss in Sugar Kiss with a recent Sephora.com order and I absolutely adore it! It's not sticky like a lot of lip glosses can be and it looks SO pretty on! It feels amazing on, too! I LOVE it!! ",0
I got a sample of this product and I used every last bit of it. It does wonders for my 57 year old hands. My granddaughter even commented on their smoothness! This is one product that I cannot be without. The camphor scent just lasts minutes but the benefits last all day. You won't be disappointed! ,4
"I got a sample of this scent via an online Sephora order. It smells horribly strong, like something only your great great grandmother would wear. ICK! Clearly I am not fond of this scent and I'm finding it HARD TO BELIEVE people would actually BUY THIS!!",0
"I got a sample of this with a recent purchase and I can't get enough of it! At first I didn't care too much for it but once the smell settled in I realized how good it smells! It has a light sweet smell, and lasts long. I am definitely going to buy a bottle of this. ",0
I got a sample with an order and loved it. The colors are not true to life on line. I ordered in #3 and had to return for #5 Perfect match. Very natural look. Love the look and feel of this makeup. It has a wonderful radiant finish. ,2
"I got into B Kamins in a spa, and have found that their products are really great at getting results. The flower water treatment spray is a staple in my gym bag... after working out and taking a shower, I don't want to fuss with a messy lotion... this makes sure my skin stays hydrated and balanced all over. It has a very light floral scent. Also good for mid-day refreshing of your skin even if you already used a lotion that morning... we all need lots of moisture! Especially in the dry winter months. ",1
"I got one of these in a kit and fell in LOVE! Now I have several colors and cruising for more ! I love the way they look natural but better on, feel moist but DON'T move or feel gooey! the colors are really pretty but have a natural base so they never look like your lips are wearing YOU into the room first. LOVE them, can't wait to get more! ",4
"I got the blue color and it was beautiful and also versatile because you could blend or deliberately pick up darker or lighter shade. However, it is very fragile and broke into a million pieces of dust when I dropped it about 1 and a half feet. There was no part of it that was saveable . I had to throw the whole thing away after only ONE USE !! Were it not so fragile I would have given 5 stars. ",3
"I got the lotion to go with my Philosophy Hot Cocoa body wash! I love the smell but it does not absorb into body well and it is a little greasy, but that was only disappointment about it! The rest is great! ",2
"I got the tawaka kit as a gift from my aunt. who knew it would turn out to be my winter survival kit? this cleanser, along with the conditioner, saved me time, and energy. It cleans my hair, body, and face, and I use it as shaving cream all at the same time. its so hydrating, moisturizing post-shower isnt even necessary. the cacao smell reminds me of the amazon rain forest, and that is quite a nice thing to think about in the dead of winter- a regimen to look forward to! my hair and skin got compliments the day i started using it- my hair was really silky soft and shiny, and my skin was smooth and hydrated. this is my all-in-one savior! ",0
"I got this and thought at first when I opened it it would be too much color and shimmer. Boy, was I WRONG! It goes on sheer and looks like you have that great summer healthy look. The golden touch makes the skn look young and dewey. GREAT pink/peach! Mix with a pretty similar lip and you look like a vision of spring freshness, soft ,sexy, and ripe with sweet color ! ",4
i got this as a christmas present and it turned out to be a better product than i expected. the nudes i wear often for a subtle shimmer at work. the navy is really a perfect dark blue shade. and the shimmers are nice to have and i would never have paid for those colors otherwise. not the greatest quality of eyeshadow it takes at least two applications to have a nice shade. ,0
I got this as a deluxe gift and I love it. The color is so pretty. I use it alone or over other colors for a nice change. The formula is like wearing silk on your lips and it lasts a surprisingly long time for such a moist formula. ,3
"I got this as a freebie for being a Beauty Insider, and I'm definitely buying it in the full size! The color I received was ""Dolly"" and it is great. I'm fair-skinned, and I thought this color was perfect--not too dark, not to bright. Non-colorwise, this is the least sticky lip gloss I've used, which I really like. Just the right amount of gloss & glitter, not overwhelming when it comes to the plumping. Worth every penny.",0
"I got this as a free sample months ago, and I LOVED it. I am a product addict, always trying new things, and this stuff just beats it all. It smells fabulous, and it went on very light and smooth. I have true combo skin (very oily in the T-zone, and quite dry in the cheeks and eyes), and this stuff worked well everywhere. It moisturized while not making me oily. Gotta love a multi-tasker! ",1
"i got this as a gift and it makes my skin super soft and smells like milk. It is very hydrating, which could be a bad thing if you prefer to be squeaky clean. I would probably use this more in the winter than in the summer. But it's a great product!",0
"I got this as a gift for my mother for Christmas, and it smells fantastic, but... the scent doesn't last. Within an hour or two, it's gone. So, great scent, great price, but not so great lasting power. ",2
"I got this as a sample at Sephora and have been using it consistently for the past 2 months....what a sample. This has become one of my favorite products. I am careful about using shimmery shadow because of my age and light lines around my eyes, however, this does not crease at all and lasts forever and I will be buying it in every color. The sample that I got is still 3/4 full so I can't imagine how long a full size tube would last. This product really impressed me and I have friends who got the sample just like me and they have vowed to use it forever as well. Laura Mercier hit this one out of the ballpark!!! ",2
I got this at the Sephora in Paris thinking it would be a great Parisian scent to add to my collection. I have never received so many disapproving remarks about a perfume. The scent is too strong and powerful. Quite overwhelming and not too pretty. Definitely smell several times before purchasing.,0
"I got this a week ago and its ok, not the best. When I first used the bionic mascara, it seemed to work pretty well at making my lashes more lush. But now the formula got all clumpy and doesn't make it easy to apply. The soft lights is a nice color and makes my skin look glowy. Its buildable so it's hard to use too much. The gloss is a nice sheer color for a glossy look but very small. Overall, this kit was ok but I won't be purchasing the mascara alone. ",0
"I got this because I had heard raves about Phyto 7 and I always like to try before I invest a lot in high end hair products. I used up all the things in this kit within a month, and loved them all! Definitely worth it to try these out. ",1
"I got this because I loved the Welcome Matte and thought I'd give the moisturizer a try and I am pretty happy. I have oily skin, and a typically normal skin moisturizers make it worse while ""oily skin"" moisturizers seem to dry my skin out rather than hydrate. This one, on the other hand, absorbs quickly, feels good, and keeps my skin hydrated and supple without adding any greasiness. And, though the pump is a little tricky, I've figured it out: before application, you have to flick the bottle upside-down once real quick to push the product to the top, where the pump tube is. One good flick of the wrist and pumping and applying is no trouble at all. ",1
"I got this because I was in the sun alot, for the uv protection. I was very pleased with the extra body it gave my hair. My hair is curly and this product is great for curly hair. And if you are blonde, another plus for this product. It seemed to enhance the color of my hair! i think it looked a bit lighter, thank you, Oscar! ",4
"I got this brush because I figured it had to be better for applying my under eye concealer than my fingers in terms of pulling at the skin around my eyes...boy was I wrong. It does a terrible job of spreading the makeup and pulls at my skin just as badly! I find that when I try to use it, I still end up running my finger under my eye to make it more even. Don't bother with this brush!!! ",0
"I got this cuz it's so cute and because everyone say these are the softest in the world. Well to be honest, it doesn't feel any softer than the really good smashbox brushes i have. Especially if you tend to do a lot of stippling. Given that, it's still a very nice brush set to have with you. The bag is spacious enuff to carry all your essentials for touch-ups. My favorite is the crease brush. I can turn it sideways and create some very detailed strokes, which I like. And the fact that it's anti-bacterial makes it even better. ",1
"I got this face kit thinking it would be a good buy. I ended up exchanging it for the full bottle of Laura Mercier coverage. I wouldn't have gotten much use out of the other products, so I think it is more beneficial to have a full bottle. The coverage is so good that I dont need the foundation. ",0
"i got this for my boyfriend as he tends to get some ingrown facial hairs, i told him it's for men and he loves it! :) and it works out well by making his skin even in tone and softness. i tried it on my face, it works well to get rid of makeup. ",0
I got this for my daugter for Christmas but it was very tempting to keep it for myself. My daughter and I have used Amazing Grace products for years. The scent is absoulutely wonderful. The lotion is by far the best lotion that I have ever used. It is worth every penney.,3
I got this for my husband as a gift and he absolutely loves it. He said it makes his skin feel great and he gets a close shave from the cream. The only drawback was how hard the tube was to open especially with wet hands. We fixed that by unscrewing the top all together. I will buy it again for him in the future. ,3
"I got this for my sister for Christmas. It was so cute I wanted to keep it for myself! Adorable music box with great colors included - all of them are wearable, which is rare in a boxed collection like this not to have a few colors that are duds. I'd say this is a great collection for a great price! ",2
"I got this in Bunny Hop to use from lashes to brow for a base coat and I love it. It does not crease at all. Other shadows, cream or powder, blend nicely with it. On the days that I use it alone, I get a dewy, luminizing, fresh look. ",3
"I got this in Dolly as a sample. It feels and smells really fresh and minty. The color is pretty, and the consistency isn't too sticky. It was only a little tingly (which I was grateful for as my lips are pretty sensitive), though I didn't think it really plumped up my lips. The color was very natural and nice. Overall, I really liked this gloss (and I'm one of the few people who doesn't generally like Bare Escentuals!).",1
"I got this in Oil Slick after being so very dissapointed by other liquid liners. This one has yet to let me down. I love the brush, although the bottle tends to get messy after a while. I wore it to an outdoor concert in high temps and humidity, and 12 hours later when I got home, it was STILL THERE! I was so sure it would have turned me into a raccoon. I'm going to have to get myself more of these in other colors. ",0
"I got this in sand which is a perfect match for my light/medium olive skin. It covers imperfections and does not look dry or heavy. Best of all, it stays on all day and feels like your skin is makeup free! I use it most days over Hope in a Bottle moisturizer; or on days when my skin feels dry, I will use a moisturizer that is a bit more moisturizing...maybe Hope in a Jar or Clinique Moisture Surge. Any blush works well over it, gels, powders or creams. Also, I like that I don't have to powder or blot all day to get rid of oily shine! It keeps the shine away. ",3
"I got this in the blond color. I have golden blond hair with nearly white blond brows. This Blond color gel at first seemed too light because I was used to Lancome's Taupe color. However, once I got used to the new look, I can tell the color is much more natural, especially in sunlight, yet gives good definition and is not too brittle and flaky when dry. It's hard to find light color brow gels and I highly recommend this one to blonds.",3
"I got this kit in deep on the recommendation of a friend, I was sort of hesitant because I had recently had a makeover in a department store and was very happy with those products, too. She kept raving about it, though, so I got it. It is long-lasting, provides a natural finish and is easy to apply. I'd recommend it to anyone. For best results, use the primer before the foundation. ",2
"I got this lipstick in Fire Down Below, it's an awesome product. not too heavy or sticky, goes on smoothly. I would definitely say you need a good liner for this color and a good lipstick brush to apply. color does stay put for a long time. very intense red color, definitely not for the faint of heart. this is, however, the first red color I've found that works well with my skin color.",1
"I got this particular lipgloss for two reasons. First, TONS of reviews recommended it. Secondly, I LOVE Korres cherry oil lipgloss. Unfortunately, the color doesn't show up on my lips. Still, it's shiny, tastes great and is not full of yucky chemicals. Therefore the 4 stars. ",3
I GOT THIS PERFUME FOR A PRESENT A YEAR AGO AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT FROM THE BEGINNING. IT IS VERY LIGHT AND CLEAN AND THE PERFECT SCENT FOR THE SUMMER. I HAVE BEEN USING IT NON-STOP I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T STOP MAKING IT.,1
"I got this primer expecting it to really let my foundation last through the night, but what I got was a greasy feeling face that didn't look any different after I applied it. I haven't noticed any difference in how long my makeup lasts when I use it, and my face doesn't look any less pore-y. I want to try some other primers, because this one just doesn't live up to the hype.",0
"I got this set as a Christmas present last year. I occasionaly use the colours but I use the black liner every day. It goes on so smoothly, even a year after opening it. It is also waterproof and stays on all day and even if I fall asleep in it. ",0
"I got this set several weeks ago and I am already in love with it. The blemishes cleared, my skin (usually very oily and uneven) got better-looking and healthier. I don't breakout anymore and even though I've used many different products before (including Proactive) this by far is my favorite. I also got the Hope in a jar and use it as evening moisturizer - works miracles for softening and evening out the skin tone. Highly recommended! ",1
"I got this when purchasing the Starter set. This is very very disappointing. Not only it's not soft, it actually poked my face so hard that it turned red; it also shreds like crazy every time I use it.",1
"I grabbed this oil on clearance, and I'm glad I did. Whenever I plan to take a hot shower (can you say dry skin?) I spritz this over my knees and elbows. The smell is syrupy sweet and sumptuous, just like the hard toffee on one of my favorite desserts. ",0
"I guess I never realized how many lashes I actually have until now. I love the Diorshow Mascara. It really makes my eyes POP! My lashes really do look thicker, more volume, and longer. I cannot believe I have been living without this stuff! ",2
I guess this is a little different package but the same great quality as the prior kohl pencil. This is my daughter's favorite and she is very picky! Long lasting and easy to apply - not too hard tipped. ,3
I had a cold when this came and my lips were positively parched! It moisturizes and takes off dry skin in the process. It tastes sweet and cool at the same time. This product takes off lipstick too for those times when you really need to rethink that color you just put on! ,3
"I had always had trouble keeping any foundation I was using from sliding off my face after a few hours, and I'm talking about the good stuff! Finally, I decided it was time to explore the wonderful world of primers. After a few misses with some brands who shall remain nameless... I tried Smashbox's Photo Finish, not only did my skin feel incredibly smooth, my makeup never looked so perfect. And I am talking about morning till night, an hour walk in Tennessee humidity and two hours at the dog park! I have not been without Photo Finish since that day. Even without makeup my skin looks fresher and more healthy! Thank you Smashbox! I never thought something so simple could change the way I look at makeup!",1
"I had a sample of Ole Henriksen that I received in my last Sephora order and loved the under makeup moisturizer. So when I saw this trio, I ordered it and use it daily...I do love the day serum and moisturizer and the night cream. I will buy again when I've used this order up. h",4
"I had a summer of the softest feet ever! This is my second purchase of this cream and it is the best moisturizer for difficult, callous prone feet. There were none this year and I felt as if I had weekly pedicures. The wonderful natural lavender plus aroma didn't fight with any scent I wore and I will never be without it again! Thanks L'Occitane for an excellent product.",4
I had a tube of this that I bought at the Sephora in Vegas in a berry color with some shimmer. It was running out so I decided to try a new color this time. The Strawberry Daquiri is what I bought and while it is a little more red than what I normally wear. I like it. It isn't too bright and it smells good and lasts a while. ,2
"I had been hanging onto a ratty old air brush for 20 years because I couldn't find one good enough to replace it. Well, this is it! Between this air brush and my excellent new blow dryer my thick, chin-length hair dries in just a few minutes, saving my hair and my sanity. It also has a nice little pull-out wand at the base for cleaning the brush of caught hairs. Would highly recommend. ",4
"I had been looking for a good boar bristle brush. I have kind of a congested scalp, and have found that brushing will encourage the natural oils to balance this situation. I was disappointed in the beauty store and drug store brushes I purchased; they were usually cheap with weak bristles or hiding among the '100%' boar bristle brushes were scratchy nylon bristles. [always look very carefully at ANY hairbrush labeled '100% boar bristle,' as this can mean there are bristles that are boar- WITH nylon. the nylon bristles are a shiny, black plastic color usually, so look for them if you want TRUE 100% boar! Sephora did NOT mislead- the bristles of this brush are truly all quality boar.] anyhoo- I made my twice monthly pilgrimage to Sephora, and was delighted to find a brush that was- not too soft, and not too firm- but JUST RIGHT! my hair is fine, and naturally curly, and this brush is soft enough so it doesn't damage it, but firm enough to do the job. the price point, for this quality, just can't be beat. thanks again Sephora! you are my beauty super-hero! ",2
I had been looking for a great concealer to cover up my thin skin under my eyes for a very long time. I saw a article in a magazine that said Benefits Boi-ing was IT for a great concealer. And their story checks out. It's not to creamy and it truly covers my dark circles. I do set the concealer after I put it on with Bare Minerals Veil and it stays all day. Finally a product that really works.,3
I had been searching for Ash Blonde without success and finally was able to order it from Sephora on line. It's THE best color for my light blonde eyebrows. It's smooth and glides on easily. Worth every penney,4
"I had been skeptical about spending so much money on these tweezers, but they enable me to easily and quickly pluck the finest hairs and even hairs so short they have barely emerged. In addition, the color makes them easy to find in my drawer or makeup bag. So far, the finish has been quite durable; not a scratch or nick on them. ",2
I had been using a different loose powder for years but when I moved to a new state two years ago I noticed that my old foundation and powder were just sitting on top of my skin and my face felt greasy all the time. I visited Sephora looking for a new foundation and loose powder and got turned onto the Vincent Longo products. I cannot imagine ever using anything else ever again. The powder is the perfect base and finisher to create a smooth surface for make-up application and setting color once it has been applied. Since I started wearing it I have gotten more compliments on how flawless my skin looks. I also like how you get coverage but there is still sheerness so you don't feel like you are wearing a mask. ,2
I had been using mositurizer that cost me $80 dollars and didn't really contain all the ingredients an anti aging moisturizer should have. The product goes on smoothly and my faces feels nourshied but not greasy. This is an amazing product especially for the price. Sephora has out done themselves with this product. I love it.!!!!! So instead of spending $320 annually on moisturizer I'll be spending $80.... ,3
"I had been wanting to try a new foundation for quite some time, and numerous people in online communites suggested the MUFE HD foundation. I am very glad I tried it! I was amazed at how well it blended into my skin (shade #117). The color match is perfect. It covers pretty well. You can use a bit more to build up coverage. It makes skin look smooth and flawless, without looking cakey as many other foundations with a lot of coverage do. It's a bit pricey for foundation, but well worth the price in my opinion. It also does not irritate my sensitive/acne prone skin. I was pleasantly surprised by this. If you're looking for a medium to full coverage foundation, I would definitely recommend this! When used with the HD powder, skin looks even more smooth and flawless,and it feels really soft. ",0
I had been wearing the same old cheapy body spray from a popular superstore chain until I smelled a sample of Black Orchid from inside a Vogue magazine and hunted it down. I'm definitly on a budget but it was well worth the cost to purchase such a decadent parfume! I recieve compliments all the time when I put this on.,1
I had bought the try me package withe concealer and brushes - the powder is stunning on - even's out my complexion - no masky ttype of finish - very natural - brightening - love it - just bought the full size - would highly recommend it to anyone.,4
"I had fine thining hair that would break when I needed a perm... not any longer, this product was great even between perms -- I used to go to the hairdresser weekly since in my early 20's - with this line, I do my hair myself... really ",3
"I had given up on ever finding anything that would work well for my very temperamental skin. Some days I had combination skin, some days it was an oil pit. Then, I received a few samples of the Ole Henriksen line and WOW!\ni was so impressed with how the samples made my face feel, I decided to buy the Three Little Wonders kit. I am so happy I did. The pores that had increased in size with every birthday have disappeared. My dark eye circles are fading so fast and even my husband has noticed how soft my skin has become.",1
I had great arms until a few years ago when out came the KP! I saw an ad for this in InStyle magazine and had to try it. The redness is greatly diminished and the bumps are not as raised. I am diligent about using it every day. It's worth it and the tube lasts a while :-).,2
"I had great expectations for this mascara after reading about it, however I found it to be no better than others I've used and the brush was difficult to handle. It also remained sticky and was difficult to remove. Given the price, I would have expected a much better product. ",4
I had heard rumors that BE was going to come out with a brush you can put Mineral Veil in and finally it's out. I bought one for me and one for my sister and I love it. I takes up just a little space in my purse and I can use it anywhere. ,3
I had heard that this was the perfect color for every one which usually puts me off. Still I tired O. But once I bought it I haven't worry. I use the multiple under my foundation and the powder blush on top. I love the slightly gold glitter. it makes me feel pretty. I am addicted.,4
"I had heard very good things about this foundation and I was eager to try it. However, once I bought it, I was highly disappointed! The color matched my skin very well-this was the closest a foundation has ever come to matching my odd skin tone. Unfortunately, this dried incredibly quick and did not blend well. It was like trying to drag clay across my face. At first, this looked amazing and I thought my dreams had come true, but I was sorely mistaken. The first day I wore this to work I was shocked when I looked in a mirror and saw all my flaws magnified! I have combination/acne prone skin. This was very drying but my T-Zone was still quite oily and the foundation looked cakey. Works for some, but not for me. ",0
I had higher expectations from a Bliss product. I kept thinking that any day I would notice my legs were still smooth (summer requires daily shave). Never happend. I could have purchased 10 bottles of St. Ives and acheived the same results. ,3
"I had high hopes for this new product, but it did not perform as advertised. It actually smudged and ran during the first day. Thinking that the problem may have been with a too-creamy undereye concealer, I gave this product two more trials, using a different concealer each time -- but with the same disappointing results. ",4
"I had high hopes for this primer as it has been tauted for so long. But, it really did absolutely nothing for me. The application of my foundation and the end result were exactly the same with the primer as without it.",3
"I had intended to buy the Lorac water based primer after trying a sample of it. After seeing the price of the Sephora brand and reading the reviews, I decided to try it instead. It does feel much like the more expensive Smashbox primer when you put it on but I can't tell that it has any lasting effect of evening out skin or making my foundation last longer. ",4
"I had my doubts about the value of adding this finishing powder to my makeup regimen. However, after a single use I don't plan to be without it as part of the routine. The finish is smooth, flawless, and so soft. I got comments, not about the beauty of my MAKEUP, but about the beauty of my SKIN. Well, that's enough for me! ",4
I had my doubts about this mascara as it is pricey but they have been subdued since I have been using the blue I ordered. I have had several compliments on my eyes and they do pop out now. This is a large tube so I think it will last awhile. I truly adore the ease it washes off but at the same time stays on until you take it off. ,4
"I had my doubts about trying mineral foundation, as I didn't really think I could get the coverage I needed. I was so wrong! After trying the sample I am completely hooked. It really is deserving of all the hype. Well worth the money! ",0
"I had never before tried a brushless mascara but this has to be, by far, the best mascara I've ever used, especially if I curl my lashes first. It places color on my lashes three times faster than mascara with brushes and it comes off quickly and clean. I also like that there are no fibers in it. It does help sometimes to comb the lashes afterwords to separate any lashes that might stick together. I will be using this product for a long time to come. ",4
I had never seen a 3 in 1 concealer before so I gave it a try. It's excellent. You have the liquid concealer on a brush or the stick concealer and the roller ball is the best idea I have seen EVER. It blends in the concealer perfectly. GREAT STUFF. ,4
"I hadn't planned on spending this much for a flat iron, but I wanted a 1"" since I recently got a shorter haircut. I considered a T3, but after talking with a sales person, who was also a hairdresser, the ghd sounded like the best choice. The heat adjusts to your hair, so less damage if your hair is colored or highlighted. It is very easy to use, warms up in about 3 seconds, allows you to get close to the scalp without burning, and provides straight and flippy/curly options. I'm totally happy with this purchase. ",3
"I hadn't used Philosophy products prior to this purchase but this 3-in-1 gel is true to its name - AMAZING!\nThe fragrance is not overwhelming, and it leaves your skin soft to touch. I would purchase this again.",3
"I had one of the orange colour and I found it look pretty on lips, smells good, SHINY, lots of sprinkles... I am so sad that I lost it!!! (I believe the colour is discountinued as well? I am not sure) ",0
I had overplucked my brows and nothing would help them to grow back!!! That is until I picked up this little miracle brow gel! I put it on my brows and lashes every night before going to bed and in about 4 weeks I noticed that my brows werre not only growing but coming in thicker!! My eyelashes were great! long ang lush!!!! I will never be without this in my make-up case!!!,3
"I had previously purchased another brush by Smashbox but much prefer this one. Since spending the money, I decided to use the Smashbox one for applying cream blushes only. There definitely is a difference between brushes, this Sephora brush I much prefer for application of primer and/or foundation as the brushes apply the product much more smoothly and evenly. When the brush hairs flow together and do not separate into groups as with the Smashbox brush. The brush cleans up effortlessly too. Definitely worth pushacing this particular brush! ",4
"I had previously purchased the bronze kit and was absolutely SOLD on it! The color looks wonderful on and I love the creamy feel of the product on my lips. Since it was so great, I bought the rose kit and can honestly say I don't like the color on me as well as the bronze color. However, the texture and coverage is still just as great as the other bronze...I'm just not as totally pleased with the rose. I know I won't try the nude now. ",3
"I had purchased this as a gift, but I suspect I'll be keeping it. This case is large and roomy. I especially like the adjustable dividers to be able to accommodate odd-sized items without wasting space. Very professional, classy appearance, milk chocolate in color, and very sturdy. ",4
"I had read great things about the Nars blush ""Orgasm"" in Beauty Magazines. I'm sorry I waited so long to try it. It gives such a natural healthy glow to the cheeks that it seems to blend in to your complexion.",4
"I had really high expectations for this product line and it fell a bit short of having me hooked. I have oily acne prone skin with hyper pigmentation from sun and acne damage and I really wanted this product to battle all the problems. My favorite product was the toner which is more excellent than the cleanser at cleaning my skin. The moisturizer and bright and clear treatment made my skin more oily I believe, but, I did have fewer breakouts. Overall, a good product for some one with mild acne and hyper pigmentation problems. ",0
"I had recently ordered this set in the Med and thought I would try the Light for the winter, but to my dismay it was much too yellow for my complexion. I sent it back yesterday (I love the no charge for exchange!) and ask the kit be replaced with the Med. I love this makeup and will continue to use it. Love the face primer also. It makes the application so much nearer perfection. ",3
"I had seen ""Rated R"" in a Sephora Store and thought it was interesting but wasn't sure if it was for me. On my next online order I decided to go for it. When it arrived I took one look at the Bright Colors and thought Oh No I can't wear that I'm too old. But I decided I needed to try it and I have to say I fell in love with it. The color goes on beautifully and is different and interesting. To think I condsidered giving it to one of my daughters. I can't wait to try some of the other duo's. They done a great job of choosing whaat colors go together. I use an eye shadow primier so the color last all day and there is no creasing. ",3
I had smelled the liquid and loved it so I ordered the solid perfume. The difference in smell was very dissapointing. The solid smells very much like tobacco and I was quite shocked. This was a definite return product for me.,3
"I had this correcting cream recommended to me and decided to try it. I love what it is doing to my face. My face is smoother, softer and younger looking. I am 47 years old with 2 grand kids that are often mistaken for my own children. I love it!! ",3
"I had this product a couple of years ago. It blends easily, and you can use less or more, depending on the look you're going for. The packaging is adorable, and the powder smells good too. I'm really pale and it warmed up my skin. ",0
I had to buy a lip venum mini so I could give my daughters each a mini one because my full size one was mysteriously appearing in thier purses! Now neither of them live at home but they have been shopping in mom's makeup bag. ,3
"I had to see what the hype was all about, so I broke down & bought this mascara. The very next day, men were absolutely mesmerized by my eyelashes! I bought the azure blue & it made my blue eyes, bluer & just jump off of my face! It's a thickening formula with a huge brush & worth every penny! I was a big fan of L'Oreal Voluminous & this is even better! I will definitely repurchase this mascara again- it is really the best! ",3
"I hated it when I first put it on, within a couple of minutes it was a bit better. I am not sure what I think about this one. I normally love warm scents but this doesn't have that ""warm"" appeal to me. I read the other reviews before I purchased it and had hoped for better. ",2
"I hate lipstick because it's usually dry and smells gross. However, the Korres Lipstick in natural pink is one of the few I like. It feels more like a lip balm and provides enough coverage to make your lips look naturally flushed. Paired with a lip gloss; particularly the fuchsia, this lipstick yields a polished look complete with moisture, coverage, and SPF. It is not a long-wearing lipstick, but a pleasure to reapply. Long-wearing lipsticks are usually not very good for you. ",1
"I HATE THE GREASY FEELING OF ANY SKINCARE PRODUCT, LET ALONE MOISTURIZER. IT GOES ON FEELING A LITTLE BIT GREASY BUT THEN ITS JUST THE SPF. I USUALLY PREFER FULL OCVERAGE BECAUSE OF MY FRECKLES AND SPOTS BUT I AM ACTUALLY PRETTY SATSFIED WITH WHAT THE SALES ASSOCIATE RECOMMENDED. IT IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND GOES ON SMOOTH. I ALSO HATE LOOKING LIKE I HAVE LOTS OF FOUNDATION ON SO THIS ACTUALLY HELPED A LOT UNDERNEATH MY PRESSED POWDER. -1 STAR FOR THE GREASINESS OF SPF. OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT",0
"I hate to admit it, but I bought this thinking it was for sun damage, brown spots. I kept using it and after about three weeks, it dawned on me -- hey I don't need my facial scrub anymore! Therefore, the terms ""microdelivery peel"" now make sense. Since I have sensitive, reddish, skin it's GREAT to stay away from abrasive scrubs. I use it on my neck too. I feel this is really worth the money as the jar has lasted quite a while using it 2-3 times a week, and I'm definitely going back for more. I really lucked out finding this substitute for my old abrasive exfoliator. And next time, I guess I should ask for help at Sephora. ",3
"I hat mornings. I hate them so much I would rather sleep another 20 minutes in the morning than take a shower. But, with Bare Minerals, I feel better about waking up because, honestly, I know that I won't feel ugly when I leave for work. I know it sounds ridiculous, but having this system allows me to feel fresh and beautiful. ",0
I have #14 and use it mainly for an under eye concealer... it matches my skin tone and I'm able to hide imperfections without getting a cakey buildup... I love the consistency of this cream... many others I have tried are just too dry... this one blends so easily. ,3
"I have 14 foundations (yes) and this ismy latest and favorite. I hope this ends my search. I have combination skin, fair with yellow undertones. I use the lift c30. It blends easily and mlts into my skin for a smooth finish. Very pretty fomula. My 81 yr. old mom also love it ! ",4
"I have 2 Nars blushes and I am absolutely obsessed with them! They are great subtle colors, but they color lasts all day, and the best part is-- they look so natural! This is the best blush on the market!",0
"I have 2 of these; one in a duo of Caviar & Midnight Brown and one in Midnight Purple and I had to average the scores out for these to a 4. The duo is a 5 for me; it goes on perfectly, smudges just the right amount, then sets and stays put, even in water. I love it. The purple one, however, is a 3; though I love the color, it's too hard, is a bear to apply and then doesn't stay on for long at all. Don't know what Smashbox isn't doing right with their formulations, but they need to work on it! ",1
"I have 3 of these and am fairly satisfied with them. The colors are great and go very well together, but I can't seem to find a base that will keep them from wearing-out. They only last on me for a couple of hours or so, which is quite unfortunate because the shadows themselves are so beautiful. :( ",0
"I have 5 different Doir compacts. I love them because of the high quality of the product and they offer interesting combinations of colors. I have green eyes and this set compliments them.(You notice the color of my eyes, not my eyeshadow.) The green is soft, and looks great as an accent color blended with the rich brown around the eye. Then I add the grayish color (in the center) to the crease, with a little of the brown blended together.The colors are not highly pigmented. The colors are soft, some having an almost etheric shimmer to them. If you want a soft natural look and eyeshadows that blend well together, I would recommend this product. ",2
"I have about six of the shades, mostly the neutral ones, and they all look wonderful on. They last a long time for a gloss, and they are not sticky at all. Has a tiny little bit of shimmer, but not too much so you won;t look like a clown if you wear it in the daytime. Highly recommended. ",0
"I have a chocolate complexioned skin and I was very reluctant to getting such a light color. However, when I did try it, I fell in love. It gave me a great flushed look! Whenever I need to look awake and vibrant, I use a dab on my cheeks and eyelids. One of my best purchase in my makeup bag!",1
"I have acne-prone, but ALSO dryness-prone skin (depends on the area of my face). I've never used a gentler cleanser that takes care of the different skin types I'm dealing with. Smells lovely, too. Lovely.",1
"I have a difficult time finding the perfect shade for my yellowy/olive skin.This one is perfect.I have found that all of the #4 LM products are great for me.I have combination skin..it gets shiny mid day,but I also have wrinkles (I am 39).I find that this powder is perfect for me over a little oil free moisturizer and under eye concealer..not a lot of coverage at all,but evens out my skin tone and controls oil.Looks natural. ",2
"I have a difficult time keeping lipgloss where it belongs. It most always goes into the lines around my mouth, however, NOT this one! I love, love, love it, the color is gorgeous (I bought the pink shade). It's a tad bit expensive but well worth every penny!!!!! ",4
"I have adult acne and after using the product for almost 2 weeks, I noticed more breakouts and less healing. The face wash does not lather the way I like and the serum burns when applied to acne. The lotion is great and helps great a barrier between the acne and makeup- love it. Good thing is that the products do not dry skin like alot of other acne products. ",2
I have adult acne and large pores. I also wear heavy makeup throughout the day to mask it. I use this clarisonic after removing my makeup with wipes to chiesel any remaining makeup off. I really like the feeling and vibrations. The one thing I notice which I love about it is that it give a little extra bang to my cleanser. ,1
"I have a few colors of the metallic and waterproof liner and went to get a new one and was SAD :( to see only one color! I love this, it really makes your eyes look sparkling in addition to really staying on all day. I tried a lot of pencils and like this the BEST! I hope the colors return. Worth the price! SO pretty on! And SEXY for evening. Can also use as a ROCKIN' shadow when smudged on lid. Really lights up eyes and anywhere else you want some magic glimmer, maybe the cupids bow of your lips Luminous and lovely. ",4
i have a friend who has used this for years and one day i read up on it at the store and decide to give it a shot. i love a natural glossy look and this gives it to me without too much effort. plus it has several other possible uses.,1
I have allergies and sensitivity to fragrance that does not allow me to use most perfumes and colognes. I found no sensitivity to Clean. I enjoy the light fragrance. I didn't have any trouble. I could still smell it but it was not overwhelming.,4
I have almost all the Flashy Liner Waterproof colors and I love that they stay put and that little sparkle gives your eyes a boost at any age. The only thing I need to watch out for with eye liner pencils is that they tug a little when you apply them. Otherwise they apply quick and they're fun! ,3
I have almost non-existent brows after years of overplucking; this smooth pencil goes on creamy and blends beautifully with it's spooler brush. The look lasts all day without touchups. This is the best brow pencil I've ever tried!,3
"I have already used Prime Time and I would not put my make-up on without it, it has made all the difference in the world in how my make-up looks, and I couldn't wait to get this kit cause I hadn't yet tried the prime time for the eyes, I just love them both. ",3
I have always been an eyeshadow fanatic but could never find a way to keep the color from staying on smoothly for a prolonged amount of time. I have found my answer!! This keeps my eyeshadow on for ten hour days and is still on when I get out of the shower. ,0
"I have always had a problem with eyeshadows disappearing hours after I applied them. However, these shadows stay on until you remove them! They do take some practice for pefect application...but well worth the effort! Removes easily with Philosophy Purity Cleanser. ",3
I have always had oily skin and makeup only lasted about 1 hr before it was absorbed into my skin. I was sent a sample of Laura Mercier Foundation Primer which I applied before my makeup. My makeup has lasted up to 6 hours totally oil free. After that I have only had to touch up with my powder. I am now able to take of my makeup at night oppossed to it coming off completly during the day.,4
"I have always had problem growing my nails. Since I started using it on a daily basis my nails are stronger and hydrated an my cuticles look great. I highly recommended to anyone who wants to have heathly, beautiful nails! Now I aable to have professional manicures! ",3
"I have always had trouble skin. Ive tried numerous products, and this is the only one that actually makes my skin look flawless. It also doesnt clog my pores like most products, I have noticed less and less breakouts the more I use it. You dont have to use very much, and it really lasts a lot longer than most of the less expensive drug store brands. Definitely worth the extra money. ",0
I have always hated trying to find a good blush. I LOVE this NARS brand though. Whether I am tan for a week or my natural color the blush works with my skin tone and looks great. I love the packaging and have found that the pallet does not get flaky like most do anfter a few uses.,1
"I have always looked for a perfect lipliner, but have never found one that I truly liked until I found this! I use the slim pencil #129, Dusty Rose, and it complements my skin tone so well and looks beautiful for hours. ",0
"I have always loved Bare Escentuals but have found it hard to take the make up with me. This little Go Bare kit is perfect for travel or touch ups. I don't wear a lot of make up and just like to highlight my eyes, put a touch of natural looking color on my face and apply lip gloss. This kit contains an eyeshadow that highlights your eyes, a rosy peach blush that goes great with most complexions, mineral veil, which evens out your skin tone and gives you sheer cover without feeling like heavy foundation, which I hate, and a natural looking lip gloss. The little box comes with brushes and a mirror. Now I can take my basic make-up on the go in my handbag. If you like the natural look, this is the kit for you. Love it! ",4
"I have always loved the Nude look, but having a lot of natural red color in my lips alwys had to improvise to tone them down so they would appear much lighter. And then I found Lip Spackle. It is a wonderful solution! In the past I have tried to use foundation, or eye primer, but not with good result; too heavy, And then I came across this wonderful product. It takes the smallest amount and it is weightless. After applying, I can apply ANY lipcolor and get the true color, but I especially love it for the beautiful Nude lips I can now attain so easily. Ladies, you have got to try this product. . ",3
I have always struggled with that oily skin break through and high shine until now. Not only does this product help control the oil but I think it is actually improving my skin; pores look smaller and skin is smoother. The price is worth the results and I will never be without this product again! ,4
I have always used oil to moisturized my hair since I was a teenager. Then iit was olive oil from the jar...now it is this product. I prefer this as it is not as heavy as olive oil and is absorbed immediately into my hair. It rinses out easily and makes my hair like silk...which is quite unusual. I love my hair when I use this and need no product after it dries. Using this helps me with time and money on a regular basis. Just try it. ,4
I have always worn Samsara it is my signiture scent....but I have expanded on my aromatic repertoire to include Pink Sugar. Whenever I wear it I someone tells me me that I smell yummy....everytime!\nWhen my friend Shannon comes over to visit she always has to squirt some on...guess what she's getting for christmas!\n....ands most importantly my boyfriend LOVES IT!,2
"I have a problem with most parfumes in that they turn very ""flowery"" on me, even if they are supposed to have more of a citrus base. Initially, Pure Grace reminds me of the summer and the old Coppertone suntan lotion my Mom made me put on at the beach when I was a kid..but it changes to a nice, fresh, and clean scent after a few minutes on my skin. I really love it and I am so happy I do NOT smell like a bunch of flowers!",2
"I have a sample of C09, talented berry and I love it. While not shimmery, it does have shine and it is creamy. It is always out of stock when I try to order(very popular). Some lights it looks more reddish brown and others more purple red. ",2
"I have a sensitive nose, and musk does not smell good on me. Heaven has too much musk and I simply can not wear it. Charms is fruity and floral. I might wear it occasionaly, since the musk is tolerable. For me, Shine is the best. Smells citrusy at first and dries down to a hard to describe exotic scent. I might eventually buy a full size botlle. Will have to wear it more, to be sure. It's great to be able to buy small quantities that are large enought to test for many days and months. ",4
I have at best average eyelashes and this mascara makes them look so much fuller and longer! I also wear contact lenses and this mascara stays on great! I highly recommend it! And I love the blue color - more of a navy blue - looks great! ,4
i have a terrible problem with my eyeliner rubbing off under my eyes & on my eyelids. first i use a pencil liner and then liquid liner at the base of my eyelashes. when i put this stuff on it reminded me of when i'm using clear nail polish & get it on my skin. it made my eye make up hard and even though it goes on clear you could tell i had something funky on my eyes :( ,1
"I have a terrible time with eye shadows, as they all irritate my eyes. Therefore I wear eyeshadow only for important occations, until I tried Laura Mercier Metallic Creme Eye Colour. I am delighted to say that my eyes are no longer red, burning and irritated with this product. I only wish they made it in non-metallic for daytime use. ",4
"I have a ton...and I mean a TON....of BE products because I love them all and only wear BE exclusively. These shadows are great for an everyday, reliable look with cool colors like pinks and plums in cheek and lip color. Also, I am one of the older gals and sparkly shadow doesn't do well on me. These shadows are subtle and flattering. Also, they are so sheer, it is hard to make a mistake and put on too much. They will definitely be one of my favorites in years to come. ",4
I have a ton of Nars lipsticks (what beauty junky doesnt?) but one shade really stands out for me. Dolce Vita paired with a natural look to a smokey eye on ANYONE looks great. I'm not a fan of pale lips on most people so i substitute this for my clients (and self!) when an understated lip is what I'm going for. It just seems to even out the lip tone and has a very comfortable texture. It lasts too! Everyone needs this shade of lipstick and gloss. I can't wait to try the blush.,0
i have a very hard time finding a gloss that isn't too gooey and smears all over my mouth. this one is perfect. easy to use and stays put. i wouldn't say it's long lasting but i doubt there is a lip gloss out there that does not have to be reapplied often. ,4
"I have baby fine hair that's also thin. This shampoo is is great. It doesn't weight my hair down, and it doesn't dry it out. My hair is also colored, and I haven't noticed any fading. I'll reperchase. ",4
"I have BABY lashes. This mascara wand is small enough to reach even the teeeny ones in the corner for volume. I never thought I'd be able to use this word when it came to MY lashed, but it is so true! I'm glad I listened to a friend on this one, now listen to me! Love it! Love it! ",1
"I have been a fan of Roxy Beauty products and their clothing line for nearly eight years. This was a brand buy at the beginning, but when I sampled it, I fell in love! It has the beautiful scent of fresh lime juice and it feels like you are coated in a citrus cocktail. It is not too strong and is very unique. ",0
"I have been doing makeup professionally for 16 years and I will not go on set without 3 or 4 packs of these in my kit. Regardless of whether I am giving a super glamorous look or a soft pretty one, everyone looks better with a few of these woven in with their natural ones. ",1
"I have been drooling over this product for over a year and I finally bought it, without ever smelling it before. When I got it, I was a little bit taken aback. It's VERY strong, but the scent is luxurious and timeless to say the least. I was skeptical, but I squirted it on my bare chest and of course of the first spray from a new bottle, it barely comes out. So I sprayed one more time, and WOW I had to take some alcohol and remove some of it because it was so strong. Once it blends with your own natural scent it is absolutely DIVINE!!! The next morning is when I really fell in love with the scent. It's worth every penny. I love a sensual, sexy and mysterious scent, one that is un-forgetable and this definitely fits the bill! Just stick to one spray, it is more than enough!!!!!",0
I have been having a lot of trouble finding a non-greasy brow pencil for about a year now. I'm very fair and my hair is quite dark so I needed a pencil that could fill in light spots with out greasiness or looking too drawn on and silly. This pencil is perfect! It is the best I have ever used and I'm currently hoping that Shiseido NEVER tinkers with this formula like so many other companies have been doing with their brow pencils. ,2
I have been hearing about this blush for forever- finally I broke down and ordered it and all the hype is absolutely true. This blush is bright without being garish and lasts all day long. I will continue to order it!,0
"I have been in search of the perfect eyebrow powder and feel I found it in this product. I like the combination of the two colors since the lighter is too light and the darker too dark if used alone , combining the two make it just the right color and allows me to control the color I want.\nThe only suggestion I would make is that for the price I think it should also include a small brow brush to apply it with.",4
"I have been looking for a ""miracle"". Just finding something that works with my skin is hard. But I think I have finally found an amazing product. I use the Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash in the morning and Purity at night. Hope in a tube both and hope in a jar both morning and night. I haven't had any break outs. And my face feels cleaner than it ever has. ",3
I have been looking for a natural make up for my complexion and was surprised that this product actually was a great match for my skin tone. I have acne prone skin and this provides great coverage for those pesky blemishes. ,1
"I have been looking for a replacement for the original Adrian Arpell undereye brightner that has been gone for a long time, and finally, here it is... This one is a bit more sheer and greasier, but it works! I don't know about using this over makeup though... I have dark circles and I tried using a yellow brightner under my eyes, and it still does not do as well as this mint color. ",3
"I have been looking for new skincare, tried several of the new ""hot"" ones, but no luck. Think I may have found what my dry sensitive skin needs. This is a great try me, love the cleanser, wish there had been an eye cream. will buy more. ",4
"I have been looking fort the Beach Bunny Palette for awhile, (my favorite for summer) and found it along with some kits I haven't used! Great colors, portable and nice little pick me up gifts for loved ones! ",3
"I have been obessed with this facewash since it came out. It gave me a healthy glow while removing all my makeup. However, once i moved into new york city i found that the facewash was no longer removing all the dirt and oil on that the city put on my skin. Sadly, i had to change cleansers to something stronger. However, for anyone who doesnt deal with the pollution and grime of a major city i highly reccomend this product!!",1
"I have been searching for a good mascara, and boy is this it!! I've never seen my lashes look like this! I have decent lashes (pretty long, medium thick) and this stuff makes my lashes look AWSOME! I didn't experience any clumping, but I don't know about flaking as I just put it on. Thanks for the reviews as that's what sold me!",2
"I have been searching for a long wearing, creamy, flattering lipstick and liner and I finally found it!! I purchased ""Blush"". It is a pretty color. Noticeable but not extreme. Natural coloring. Would recommend for work or weekend. ",2
"I have been through countless eye creams over the years and this has to be one of the best. It is lightweight but hydrating, doesn't sting my eyes, and leaves the skin around my eyes soft and smooth. There are other nice eye creams, but I think this is the best value for the money. A beauty routine staple.",4
"I have been through countless hairspray brands, always looking for just the right one, and this one is it. The hold is soft and natural, and if I want to add more I can do so without it getting sticky or stiff. It has a nice scent, but it will not compete with your fragrance. ",4
"I have been using Baby Grace for at least seven years and I have tried to find other fragrances that satisfied me as much and were not ""perfumey"" but so far Annick Goutal's Flovaril is the only one I like. This is just a scent that is loved many and you will get compliments. It is comforting. ",4
"I have been using Bare Escentuals since it first came out, and when they introduced Buxom Lips a couple years ago, it became my go-to lip gloss...I just discovered the new Full Color line and I am blown away! The color lasts for HOURS and it still has that great lip-plumping-tingling feeling; it IS the best lip gloss out there. ",0
I have been using Bare Minerals for over 7 years and absolutely LOVE all of their products! Mineral Veil is the perfect shine stopper. Having it in a portable flow through brush is the perfect creation. ,1
"I have been using B.E. for many years now. I have always loved the fact that the products are compact and travel incredibly well. I was so excited to see this on the go package. I carry this with me ALWAYS. Even if I don't use anything but concealer, I use the mineral veil with it and it makes my skin look fabulous. One container is always better than two, and this is a great transfer system. Buy it now!!!! ",3
"I have been using Jurlique for five years and it is the best. The recovery gel is amazing. It may seem pricey but when you look at what you get-and more importantly what you don't get (like chemicals,perfume)-it is worth it! ",3
I have been using Lemon-aid for about 8 months. It is very easy to put on eye lid.It does not burn/sting the eyes. It pretty much stays on much of the day. I sometimes use it under my eye shadow. Most of the time I use it alone. ,4
i have been using mineral veil as a powder over my liquid foundation. your skin will look amazing. looks as though you are walking around with a soft light on your face. pores appear so much smaller. i have become a BE convert since trying their kits. love the eyeshadows and liners also. they stay put all day. LOVE!!! ,3
"I have been using Nars blush for years and I absolutely love it! I can't go a day without it and its the only one I use. Most of my makeup is by Nars and I love it. Definitely a must have prouct. Goes on, stays on. Perfect color for all skin tones. Highly Reccommend it.",1
"I have been using Philosophy Purity for several years now...and it has to be the most wonderful cleanser EVER made !!\nMy skin stays clear and smooth and Purity does not dry my skin out either ....and for a woman of mature age, that is amazing in and of itself.\nI HIGHLY recommend this product.",3
"I have been using Shiseido sunscreen for years by now and I just love it! It truly gives a lightweight feeling although the SPF is very high. Not greasy at all, but absolves quickly enough. also very effective! This is a perfect sunscreen for face. ",0
"I have been using Skin Rev-er Upper for about a year and my skin does feel soft and smooth. I apply it twice a day under my moisturizer and it's so lightweight that I can't even tell it's there, so makeup goes on with no problems. I use other products with glycolic acid as part of my skincare regimen, and I must admit that I don't really notice the difference when I stop using the Skin Rev-er Upper. However, it is quite refreshing and I do believe it helps to nourish my skin, so I will probably continue to use it. The scent has grown on me. ",1
I have been using step 3 lotion for more than 1 year. it's light and really moisturizing. I just put it on once a day. step 3 along already costs $23. with $24 you get three steps. great deal. I'm not a fan of cleansing soap though. it dries out my skin. ,1
"I have been using Strivectin-HD serum and the creams for about 18 months with good results. I saw the Peter Thomas Roth ""Age Defense Kit"" and thought I would give it a try. I was amazed how well it works! I think I am going to completely switch over. As a note: before I tried the Strivectin, I had the filler shots done, and both of the over the counter products work better than the shots did, without the bruising and swelling. ",4
"I have been using the face primer for about a year. Love, love it. Makes skin seem to be absolutley flawless & mineral make-up goes on much easier. New on eye primer & have been using only about a week now. ",4
I have been using the Hydro-Liquid Compact for weeks now and I must say it is the very best foundation I've used in years. It can be worn sheer or add more for extra coverage. It has a velvet like feel to it & yet appears dewy . I will be using this for some time. ,4
"I have been using the moisturizing dew without SPF for a year and I love it. This product is slightly thicker, and doesn't melt in as quickly, but its worth it for the SPF. I have never used an SPF that is so light and wearable all day. ",1
"I have been using the original Purity for sometime and I love the product. I received this one as a sample, and I love it! It deep cleans my skin and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I love it! I will use this new version from now on! ",0
"I have been using these products for about two weeks and my skin feels fabulous. I love the mousse style of the hope in a jar. The mask combo feels like it is actually doing something. The cleanser and the cleansing scrub leave my face feeling clean and stimulated. I have not noticed anything miraculous yet, but I am guessing it would take more than two weeks for a real miracle. ",3
I have been using these vitamins for years and haven't found any better. They are expensive but I only take one packet a day instead of 2. They give me great energy and if I run out I can always start to tell that I don't feel as good as when I am taking them. I highly recommend these vitamins - both for the quality and the convenience of having everything you need in one little packet. ,1
i have been using this blush in Org*sm for a few years now and it is by far the best blush I have ever worn. Before finding this shade I was always kind of afraid of blush. The colors i tried never seemed to look right on me. When I tried Org*sm it was perfect. This looks great on so many different skin tones. I love it!,0
"I have been using this bronzer for about a month now. I like the fact that it is not peachy at all, and does not make you look orange. Even though it looks dark in the package it goes on really nicely and you can create a sublte tan look. I knew this product was a winner when I went to dinner with my husband after the first time I used it and he told me I looked like I was glowing.",1
"I have been using this concealer for years. I find it has the best texture and coverage of any I have ever tried. The lightweight, powdery finish blends well and never looks greasy, cakey or too ""made up"". Although it's highly pigmented, it always looks very natural. It's great for dark under-eye circles, blemishes, and even broken capillaries, and also makes a terrific matte base for eyeshadow. But the best feature is its last-ability - it stays on all day, through humidity, exercise, and even my allergy-prone runny eyes! HIGHLY recommend -especially the ""Matte Light"" for fair skin!! ",3
"I have been using this faux tan for about 6 months now and truly will never be without it. I cannot believe how natural it really looks on your face. Have tried a lot of other bronzers, and they would always leave my face looking like a fake orange tinge, this FAUX TAN leaves your face glowing with a natural tan, no-one would ever guess its faux. I also in the summer dust it lightly on the tops of my hands, shoulders, and neck and it blends so well. (Really gives you a natural tan look) Highly, highly recommend this AWESOME PRODUCT!! ",2
"I have been using this for 1 year and I am hooked. I use it along with the emulsion, for a fresh, sweet, clean smelling body. My daughter who is at college, said, mom I just love to hug you, you smell like ""Amazing Grace""",3
"I have been using this for about 2 years - have gotten my Mother, Mother-in-Law and husband started using too for differing reasons. I have dry/sensitive skin. This product takes off the makeup (waterproof mascara too), takes of the overall grime of the day, and does not leave my skin feeling painful and dry.\nIt is not gimmicky. It doesn't smell like flowers or grapefruit or baked goods. It does not foam and make a mess - it rinses easily (good for wasing your face at the sink). It works every bit as well as advertised.",1
"I have been using this for years and think it is fabulous! It goes on well and is never greasy or heavy. I have acne prone skin and this really helps unlike other products which cause me to breakout. The only drawback is that there is no spf in it. Luckily my foundation has a high spf so I am covered, but just keep that in mind. ",1
I have been using this foundation for quite some time. You adjust the amount of coverage you want. I like it on the lighter side so I don't look as if I am wearing a foundation. Since I am a more mature woman I like the fact it is a creamy foundation and doesn't dry my skin out. I apply it with a Sephora foundation brush and it glides on effortlessly. It hides all flaws. It is only $9.75 instead of $39. right now. Some of the colors are out of stock but if yours is in.....take advantage of the unbelievable price right now! ,3
"I have been using this hairspray since it first came out. I think it is a good hairspray for my fine hair. Until I get some of this product in my baby fine, limp hair, it won't do anything. Sometimes I just turn my head upside down, spray, and then finger comb my hair. It usually looks good when I do this. Right after shampooing, I spray a little at the root as I blow dry with my brush. Good product. ",4
"I have been using this kit for about 5 months now and have been happy with the results. This is the first time I have used a powder foundation of this type and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It does not feel heavy at all; feels natural. This kit comes with a light shade and medium shade, so that you can blend them for just the right shade. I also love the blush hue that comes with this kit. Kind of a peachy glow. I have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding coverage on acne. It doesn't cover acne well, so if that is a concern for you, I would keep that in mind before purchasing. ",3
"I have been using this lipstick for nearly a year and love it. I use Roman Holiday and it is the perfect pink shade for me. I chose it initally because it was used on Katherine Heigl on the cover of InStyle magazine and I liked the color, but I have continued to purchase it because it is moisturizing, and makes my lips stay soft all day.",2
"I have been using this makeup remover for a while and simply love it. I used Lancome for years and picked up the Sephora Brand while shopping in the store because I had ran out of Lancome and I have been using Sephora ever since. It removes all of my eye makeup. It may be a little greasy for some people, but not for me. ",3
"I have been using this mascara for three years, and while I resent the price, I love the effect. My lashes always look great, even twelve to sixteen hours after application. I have tried many others (from cheaper to more expensive) and I always come back. Oh, FYI the Black looks a little blue when you are backlit because of the primer. Doesn't bother me but sometimes people ask if I am wearing blue mascara. ",2
"I have been using this mask for almost a month to fade some sun spots caused by medication I used to take. The formula is very creamy, and one tube lasts me for 3 or 4 applications. When I wash it off, my face always looks brighter. Also, my face does not feel dry or stripped afterward. This has not been an overnight miracle, but my spots have faded. I don't know if they would resurface if I were to stop the mask. However, I am willing to keep spending the money on this mask because it is a really cost-effective way to fade sun spots. ",1
I have been using this pen for about a month and love it. It is easy to use and not messy or too oily. I put it on after a shower and am able to type while it soaks in without any mess! Already I have softer cuticles with fewer hang-nails. The lavender scent is subtle. ,1
"I have been using this powder for several years. It is fantastic! No matter if I have a tan or am pale, this powder goes on without ""coloring"" your facial tone, yet it provides an incredibly beautiful finish on your face. It makes your skin have a smooth silky look. Best of all, the product lasts forever! ",4
"I have been using this primer for about a year now, and absolutely love it. I tried the light version, since I have combination skin, but I didn't like the texture of my skin as much as with this one, so I switched back. Leaves skin very smooth and even-toned. On the weekends, I just put it on over moisturizer and go!",2
"i have been using this product for about 2 months and have not noticed any positive differences in my face. i like the wash, but wish it worked more aggressively on my skin's condition with breakouts. it has a strong minty scent. ",1
I have been using this product for about 5 years now and I think it's great. It makes my Bare Escentuals foundation go on so smooth. Would highly recommend to anyone using Mineral makeup. I don't know if it has the same benefits under liquid foundation. ,2
"I have been using this product for a few years now and I love it! I keep one at work, in my purse, and in my nightstand. I mostly use it on my cuticles and hands because I work in the medical field and have to wash my hands so much that dryness becomes a problem. I recommend this product to anyone who needs something extra special for their hands.",1
"I have been using this product for at least 5 years now. IT's a must have for girls that are in love with liquid eyeliner - especially with cat-eyes. Precision is everything - and wen you finally get your liquid liner perfect, it only makes sense to have a product that will keep it looking that way. I have literally fallen asleep in my makeup (shame on me, I know) - only to wake up the next day with eye makeup that is almost still there enough to walk out of the house! Also, it lasts FOREVER. I'm pretty sure I've purchased 4 bottles TOPS since I discovered its wonders. ",0
"I have been using this product for a year. I have extremely dry skin especially the bottom of my feet. This lotion is therapeutic and has completely cleared up the dry, itchy, flaky skin on my feet. I wouldn't be without it! ",3
"i have been using this product for well over a year and am extremely happy w/ it. i have thin, blonde brows that are enhanced w/ this product. i can make my brows as dark as i want - darker for evenings out - it's amazing what good brows do for one's appearance. ",4
"I have been using this product for years now on my thighs and it gives a smooth contour efect ,the bulge is gone now.Jeans look great withourt looking ""hippy"".It does not have any offensiive smell and no perfumy smell either.I dont like products with perfume so this siuts me very well and does the job it supposes to do.worth the price. ",4
I have been using this set of Ole Henriksen products for over a year and I can honestly see a difference in the fine lines and texture of my skin. I'm 47 years old and I believe this product is making a difference in keeping my skin in the best possible condition for my age. I will not be without it and I keep coming back for more!,3
I have been using this stuff for about six or eight months now and I love it. I wouldn't want to live without it. I have combination skin (oily in T-Zone) that gets really oily in the summer but I also want to combat aging. This stuff is a great toner it really cleans your skin and it seems to exfoliate well and thus aids in the absorption and effectiveness of my other products. I think I am going to try some of the other products in the line as soon as I finish off some of my other brands. I highly recommend it if you have oily skin or combo skin and are looking for something that really works well. Others have commented about the bad smell but that smell only lasts about a minute and there is no residue left behind. ,2
"I have been using this wonderful fragrance for about 3 years now and everytime I wear it I get stopped and asked what is that I have on and I just say DKNY, why give out my secret :) It is light, airy and not overpowering. You know when a man asks you what it is, it's got to be working.",4
I have been wanting to try this blush for quite awhile now after hearing so many glowing reviews. And it is everything everyone says it is and more. I got it in Sin and really like the color alot. I plan on purchasing more in the future.,2
I have been wearing Light Blue for about 7 years and don't know what I would do if D&G ever stopped offering it. Thank you Sephora for providing free shipping and allowing me to use a coupon for my purchase! You rock!,1
I have been wearing Shalimar for 47 years. I have tried many other fragrances during my life time but get more compliments and comments when I wear my all time favorite fragrance SHALIMAR. You will never go wrong wearing this\nfragrance.,4
"I have been wearing this mascara for years now and I am happy with it every time. It's pretty much the same formula as Dior Show, same concept of a large brush but it's cheaper! It gets all your lashes really well and makes them longer and thicker instantly. If you really want a dramatic look use 2 coats. Also it's really black so it plays up your eyes automatically even if you wear it alone without liner or eyeshadow.",0
"I have been wearing this scent for about 3 years (exclusively) ever since I smelled it on a 20-something young lady who came into the jewelry store where I work. I smelled the light clean scent across the counter. I had to ask her what it was. She wasn't very clear on the name, said it was ""something"" Grace and she got it at an upscale department store (where I never shopped) . But I HAD TO have it! So I went to the fragrance counter and asked for the product..not knowing there were several to choose from. I smelled ALL the ""Grace"" scents before I got to Amazing! I get compliments at the malls, at the grocery stores and at work my co-workers tell me over and over how good it smells..and it lasts all day! Why would I wear anything else if I'm getting THIS kind of attention!",4
"i have blade runner (received as a gift) and i really like it. the quality is nice, and there isn't a lot of creasing. while i like it, i'm not sure i would pay for it for myself, there are others just as nice at a lower price point (see stila) ",0
"I have blond hair and thin, light eyelashes. I got a sample of this mascara from Sephora and gave it a try. It does a great job of lengthening and thickening without getting clumpy. I don't care much about the conditioning part...I just need serious help with my wimpy lashes.",2
"I have both shades of ""caramel"" and they are my current favorite neutrals. Both are sheer but one is a lighter brown while the other deeper and redder. The fact that they are not super moist helps them stay on longer. I just ordered a third color, cream one this time. Can't wait to get it. I'm a real lipstick girl!! ",4
"I have bought many disappointing hair products in my day. This is exactly what it professes to be. It is weightless and it truly prevents frizz. I tend to get a ""halo"" of frizz around my face, but not with this balm. And it makes my hair very soft. I love this product. ",2
"I have brown hair and the brown shades blend well with my brow color. I use the petite stencil, which really helps to get a uniform shape to my brows. I like to use the wax to comb my lashes up and it wears well throughout the day. Highlighter is subtle, which I like. ",3
"I have Cargo lip glosses, I have other compact lip glosses..they have no brush! What's a girl to do? Buy one of these! They rock. It retracts so it stays clean. Heck you can even preload it with your fav. lipgloss and retract it. This is one of my favorite beauty tools. ",2
I have Catalina and it looks beautiful. It blends amazingly and the jar lasts for a very long time even though I wear it everyday. I have fair olive skin and this color looks very natural even though it looks neon in the jar. ,0
"I have Clinique's Fresh Bloom All-Over Colour in Peony. It's a beautiful blush that's subtle and shimmery. When worn alone, it adds just enough color so that it looks like you're not wearing blush, but actually ""blushing"". For a more dramatic, longer-lasting effect, I brush it over my Smashbox O-Glow. These vibrant pink hues swept together created the perfect blush. Definitely worth the buy! ",0
"I have color/highlights done every 5 weeks, and I have medium weight hair. This helps with the frizzies and makes my hair shinier and thicker. I lose many fewer hairs since starting this routine (including the conditioner). ",4
"I have combination oily/dry skin and this product is the only one I can use to keep the pH balance in skin normal. It is a thorough, yet non-stripping cleanser and the bonus is that it removes make-up at the same time as well!",0
"I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts in the summer and when the seasons change but also have very dry cheeks. This cleanser is perfect -- it is gentle, definitely foamy and always helps clear up breakouts within 3-5 days. ",2
I have combination skin and have tried all kinds of products. This is the first one that has stopped the oily feeling in my T zone. Will never have to find anything else to use. The improvement in my skin apperance and texture is amazing. ,4
I have combination skin that needs a light moisturizer before applying mineral powder makeup. This absorbs quickly and provided just enough moisture. It did not cause me to break out like some other moisturizers. Two negatives could be the herby smell and the fact that it might not moisturize enough during the winter months.,1
I have combition and somewhat sensitive skin and this stuff does awesome things. Not only gets rid of flakes but somehow balances the oilier parts as well. The couple mornings a week I use this my makeup goes on and looks flawless. ,1
"I have combo skin and found this product by accident when I was looking at Dr. Brandt's poreless line for oily skin... needless to say I use it everyday, whether alone over my moisturizer or under my Bare Minerals makeup. Either way... my skin feels and looks much smoother and even. Several people have commented on my skin since using this product, that was not the norm before, believe me. I believe anyone would benefit from this product as an under foundation evener and if oily patches, it absorbs the oil nicely. Love, Love, Love this product!!!!!",3
"I have combo skin with occasional adult acne. I use this Hope in a Bottle both morning and night during the spring/summer months. During winter, when my skin starts to dry out, I use this for mornings and use regular Hope in a Jar for evenings. I like that this absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a feeling of residue on my skin. ",2
I have concealer brushes to even our darker areas and age spots and imperfections/blemishes from a number of companies and have paid more than $22 for most of them and yet this is the one I reach for so often I just put the others in a drawer. I use it with Bare Escentuals bisque concealer and it is small enough to use on a snamall blemish and around the eyes. It seems to hold just the right amount and covers evenly ,4
I have confused combo skin (oily forehead and chin and dry or normal everywhere else) so it's really hard to find a product that won't break me out or make me drier. I swear I will have this product in my shower for the rest of my life. It scrubs any flakes away without irritating and helps clear up some of the congestion in my oilier areas. I use this 2-3 times a week and my foundation has never looked so good. ,1
"I have course, thick, semi-curly/frizzy, color treated hair and this really helps smooth my hair out with just a blow dryer. I still set with curlers, curling iron or a flat iron, but I have to say that if I'm in a pinch it makes a difference. I've tried some of his other products, didn't love them, but this one I love! ",2
"I have curly hard to manage hair and I can't live without this. It's meant specifically after you dry your hair, but.... it works great if you put it in before you dry (air or blow). I never have a bad hair day with ""dirt."" ",4
"I have dry hair, but not as severly dry as need be for this shampoo. When I suffer through using this so I don't waste my money, my hair feels greasy. I can only dare use this once a week and alternate with other shampoos as it never feels washed out. ",3
"I have dry, mature skin and most daily moisturizers are either not rich enough or are too heavy to wear under make-up or when it's warm outside. This is just perfect - blends in well, doesn't feel greasy, but leaves my skin feeling soft and well hydrated - plus it is an excellent anti-oxidant treatment as well. The best moisturizer I have ever used. ",4
"I have dry skin and have a hard time finding a face wash that doesn't dry my skin out and leaves my skin feeling clean. This was recommended to me by a sales associate and I gave it a try. I absolutely love it! If you have dry skin and want a great wash that leaves your skin refreshed and hydrated, this is for you! It is a little pricey, I'm used to drug store prices, but lasts so long it really ends up being a great deal!",1
"I have extremely dry skin and have had trouble finding a good cleanser that doesn't leave my skin greasy or too dry. This one is perfect. I keep one in my shower for morning cleansing and one in the cabinet for night cleansing. It's creamy, smooth and feels great ",3
"I have extremely pale skin (even in summer) with blue undertones. I expected to like Party Crasher, and I do, but was surprised to also find that Breathless and, my favorite of all, Dessert First, look good with my light skin. I never wore lipstick before I discovered these because it seemed too dry and dull. But these lipsticks ARE wonderfully silky and nearly as moist and sheer as lip glosses. ",2
I have extremely sensitive as well as aging skin. This Caudalie product is gently effective without irritating my skin. I like the fact that it has natural ingredients. Unlike many other skincare products it does not have a strong fragrance which bother my allergies. The best news is that it works! It makes my skin look and feel smoother and softer. ,4
"I have extremely sensitive skin, so I have tried all kinds of products in all kinds of price ranges in an effort to find one that was not harsh on my face or caused my face to break out. This one is a winner!",2
"I have extremely thick hair, and it's chemically abused from coloring. I absolutely loved what this did for my hair but I hate how watery the formula is. I used way more then I should have because it just would not lather up for me, which is why I docked it 2 stars. I just wish the formula was a little less runny. ",0
"I have fairly dark undereye circles and don't like to use a typical concealer because I think it draws more attention to the problem. Well Touche Eclat in shade 02 has become my HG! People have even commented how bright my eyes look and it is so easy to use. I use it under my eyes, on the inner and outer corners and any where I might need a ""little lift"". My only negative comment it that it was rather quick to spoil, I noticed a little mold on the applicator and had to throw it out before it was used up. It may have been sold to me as an old product thought, not sure. All in all this product is worth the money and very good.",2
"I have fair skin and I think this looked perfect on me. I don't like anything very shimmery and I think this had just the right amount to give me a subtle glow. I think that the people that think it's too shimmery are putting on way too much. If you think it's too intense, just don't put so much on. This should be applied with a very soft brush and it has to be worked into the brush. Try just touching the brush to the cake and then tapping the brush hairs against the mirror so the powder will go into the brush and apply to your face in sweeping motions. This is the best bronzer I've tried.",0
"I have feet so dry they crack and bleed. These do soften feet, breathe on top which is more tolerable for long wearing, the 3 stars is because there is seemingly no way to really clean then, good for 30 uses, but wash your feet first and cover up with socks or slippers, Seems a little non-hygeinic, BUT they help..they're still new so we'll see in a few days...perhaps 3 pairs per packet with less ""wear"" in each so they can be disposed of and cleaner one's put on ",2
"I have finally found a full color, shiny gloss that lasts fairly long per application. No more tube of lipstick and gloss and blah blah blah. I had read some negatives about the brush applicator and finding it awkward...not so. If you have any experience working with a lip brush, you will love this. I does require playing with application a couple of times, but I always play with anything new before I wear it in public. I love the tingly feeling as it warms up on my lips. Now I just need more colors...;-} ",3
"I have finally found my Holy Grail -- my perfect foundation -- thanks to Aldona at the Westfarms Mall store. She highly recommended it, applied it for me, and VOILA! I suddenly had flawless, natural-looking skin! No concealer, no blush, nothing else needed! PLUS, it was $15 less than the foundation I was using before! I could hardly believe it myself! THis gift from the makeup gods goes on easily with your fingers, a sponge, or a brush. It blends seamlessly and makes me look 10 years younger (eliminates spots, discolorations, doesn't highlight lines and wrinkles, etc.). It is very moisturizing for my dry skin and keeps me looking dewy fresh. I plan to try the HD powder and other items in this line in the future. I think I'll be buying stock in this company! ",3
"I have fine, color treated hair and have tried them ALL. This spray doesn't coat hair in some gooey mess. It's clean, easy to use and leaves hair with about as much volume and lift and you're going to get from fine hair. ",3
"I have fine, curly hair. This is the perfect product for when I want to leave it curly and air dry it AND if I want to blow dry it straight. You don't need a lot so it lasts a long time. Also great to put on after stying to smooth and shine. The only hair product I'll use now! ",2
"I have fine hair, so hairsprays that aren't stiff tend to do nothing for me. This spray, however, gives me good hold withou stiffness. It also leaves hair shiny and washes out easily. This is a good product! ",2
"I have fine hair that tends to break easily especially if I have had it colored recently. A lot of leave in conditioners make my hair limp but this one prevents breakage, saves my hair color and doesn't make my hair limp. ",2
"I have fine, oily hair that I abuse daily with washing and blow-drying and monthly with color and highlights. I was beginning to see quite a bit of damage as my hair aged and began trying all sorts of hydrating shampoos. Most left my hair limp and flat. I've been using Ojon Hydrating Thickening Shampoo for several months now. It has significantly reduced my dry, split ends without making my oily scalp worse, and I love the volume it gives my hair. I do use both the shampoo and conditioner together. ",3
"I have fine to normal hair and have been looking forever for a product that actually works...finally found it! it doesn't make my hair feel ""heavy"" but it makes it light and full of volume...also soft and smooth. I love this stuff! ",0
"I have found the key to using this product is to not use very much of it. It is not necessary to use a lot to get results. I found it to be not gummy at all, and it responds nicely to heat treatment. It's not my favorite, but it is definitely a useable product, and is better than most. ",0
"I have four of these colors and they are wonderful. Zero smudges at the end of the day, but the others are longer wearing - they set well, go on easily without skipping and come in gorgeous colors. Don't be afraid of the purple color lust - you'd think it's teenager-y, but it's not. It's gorgeous on brown eyes.",1
"I have genetically dark undereye circles. This concealer is light and blends well without pulling, the yellow-based c-3 does a better job of hiding the blue than anything else I've tried. The pot looks tiny, but seems to last forever, making it a very thrifty choice too. I like that!I ",4
"I have had great luck with NARS eyeshadow. My favorite is Cyprus - a really pretty bronze. Goldfinger looked just yellow applied straight on, but with a good primer it came out really nicely gold. Lasts all day. ",1
I have had more compliments on this fragrance than any other product I've ever used. Is very subtle and smells wonderful! I only wish they would come out with a powder to go along with the lotion. I prefer the lotion to the spray perfume...lasts longer. ,4
"I have had problems with lots of mascaras bleeding onto my undereye area. This mascara stays on all day and stays fresh looking. Also, it is easily washed off using the Philosophy Purity face cleanser. ",3
"I have had the KP bumps for a few years now. I use this scrub once a week in tandem with the kp duty cream and after 1 month the bumps and redness are gone! This scrub works well on your other bumpy parts too! I am so happy that the Sephora advisor showed me this scrub! If you have the dry, bumpy, back of arm bumps that look like chicken skin or have any kind of acne looking bumps and scars, it will make a huge improvement. I am seeing the scarring fade from years of irritation and picking. This product works! Im sold forever! Thanks Sephora!",3
"I have had tons of issues with my skin. I've struggled with breakouts, tightness, oiliness, big pores, and even flakiness in certain areas. After a consultation with a Sephora employee, I found my answer. Use a gentle cleanser (THIS ONE) that will remove makeup and dirt daily without over-drying my skin. Then, once or twice a week use a cleansing mask (bliss steep clean for me) to deep clean my big pores of all the dead skin without drying/stressing my temperamental skin. So far (after 1.5 bottles), I've been able to totally avoid the big, red, deep pimples that made me really self conscious even though they were occasional (hormonal breakouts, I think). Nothing but a few blackheads and an occasional whitehead now. I'm a believer!",1
"I have had women and men chase me down in malls, Doctors office, grocery stores.....to ask me about the name of my perfume.\nSexy, alluring, romantic scent.\nGo for it girls!!!You won't be sorry. I'm not......Shadi",3
I have heard some really great things about Laura Mercier and wanted to try it out. I want a bit more coverage then the tinted moisturizer gives me. I like the Stila illuminating moisturizer much better. The powder is nice but I am not sure for all over use. I just don't know that this is the one I will stick with. ,2
"I have held on to my BAD gal mascara for too long - but I can't let go! Even still, after a time frame I'm embarrassed to admit, the mascara wand/formula applies to my lashes perfectly. I have naturally long eyelashes but often wage a war with trying to get them evenly separated - there is never a problem when I wear BAD gal. I always feel glamorous. Try the black with some gorgeous liquid black lined cat-eyes.",0
"I have horribly dry skin, and Alaskan winters do not help at all (nor does walking around on campus at 40 below!). My normal foundation can't cut it up here, so I ran to our local clinique for some rescue. This stuff is fantastic. It's super creamy, hydrating, and after being outside in the cold I came in to put this on and not a single flake appeared. I was so pleased. It matches my skin tone perfectly (which I have problems with) and it doesn't look like I have makeup on at all. I've coupled this with the almost makeup moisturizing compact and I'm in love. I'm glad to be back with this company! ",0
"I have incredibly oily skin and decided to trying something simple for cleansing. Like many of the other reviews, this really cleans my skin. I wear a lot of makeup every day and this removes it all. I love how my skin looks and feels thanks to this product. There is a definite improvement!",1
"I have incredibly oily skin and no matter what kind of mattifying ability a brand says their product has, I'm always a greaseball. This product is amazing! I never thought about going to the source of the problem - my pores! Usually by the time I get to work, I have to break out the powder. Now, I have a healthy glow and don't need powder until noon or so. A VAST improvement! I would think this is too drying for anything less than oily skin.",1
"I have item in the ""blend (apricot color)"" and the texture is just to die for. I wear it alone to even out my complexion and when I go out i layer it with bare minerals or mac studio fix and its an airbrushed finish! I will by the one that has the purple tint too (even yellow tones)!! Must try!",1
"I have just gotten a new supply of my new favorite lip gloss. This stuff can be worn all by itself, as I did last night, and I looked and felt fabulous. It's shiny,glittery,moisturizing, and feels so plumpy! Love all the new colors!",3
"I have Knickers, which has more of a pinkish-berry tint than swatch shows. This lipstick lasted through 8 hours of sorority recuritment without a touch up or more importantly, without winding up on my teeth. I look forward to trying more colors. ",0
"I have large blue eyes and mascara is a must have to show them off. I had high expectations when I ordered the Chestnut Brown Dior as I have tried just about every mascara on the market and I saw that this one had consistantly won ""Best"" annually. Not at all Disappointed! ",3
"I have light eyelashes and really no ""pop"" to my look unless I use mascara and eye makeup, but this liner is just the right thing for depth and emphasis for me. I have tried many types and this is an easy liquid that dries quickly and gives me a look without being too harsh or overdone. ",4
I have long lashes they just don't have volume. Lash Injection gives me more length and the volume I like without any smudging. I went the other day after work for a facial and when the girl put the pads over my eyes my mascara never even smudge. ,3
"I have long lashes to begin with but BADgal just intensifies them. I always come back to BADgal after trying new mascaras, it doesn't leave smudges like most mascaras do. I only wish that there was a waterproof one.",1
I have long thick color-treated hair that gets dry on the ends and this color mask is like a drink of water for my hair - especially the ends that can feel dry due to coloring/processing. Its a little expensive but worth the money I'll save by trying other products that don't work as well. ,1
"I have looked for years for the perfect lipliner...I've been using it since my twenties, a hard habit to break. Anyway, unless I am wearing dark lipstick, which I rarely do, I have not found a lipliner that would complement my skin and not leave a ring that showed through my lipstick. This is the product I've been looking for forever. It allows me to have the natural look that I want, with the control that I have been used to after years of using lipliner. It would also double in a pinch as a concealer if necessary, so it's nice to have in your bag. I've tried every color, even the clear ones at every price and nothing compares to this lipliner. Thanks Cargo! ",2
"I have lost count in the amount of concealers I've tried. This one is very moisturizing which is very nice - but the coverage is not as good as it can be - I still look ""tired"" after putting it on. I use it with either Laura Mercier or Bobby Brown as a base. If you don't have very dark circles give it a try - I'll use t up but won't rebuy. ",4
"I have lots of sun spots from excessive tanning, and after I stopped my sun exposure, I was left with lots of freckles. I have tried many skin-lighteners in the past, and try to stay away from hydroquinone, and this acutally works. Other people were able to notice that my sun spots were getting lighter and now I wear sunscreen to prevent them from coming back if I go back out into the sun. Leaves my skin smooth, moisturized and brighter!",0
"I have lots of yellow undertones in my olive skin. This adds a glow I haven't seen since my 20's. I brush it on top of my foundation, and then I also use LG's baked blush (Sunswept), and Voila! Nice and dewy!! ",2
"I have loved all other ghd products I've tried, but I sent the Sea Spray back. After the birth of my son, my normally straight, heavy hair became wavy and slightly curly. I bought this product to help enhance that--but all it did was make my hair crunchy and unmanageable, even with a very tiny amount. Not sure what happened here, but this was a major miss for me. ",1
I have loved Clean forever. The scent lasts a long time and smells like a shower or freshly laundered sheets and is never overpowering. This is a great set to try the different scents. I also think it will last me at least a year or more to finish all of them!! I also LOVE the rollerball set. ,2
"I have loved Michael Kors since it first came out, and recently sent it as a gift to a dear friend who had opened her home to me for a friend's wedding. She loves it, too! I was happy to spread the great aroma!",4
"I have loved pink sugar since the first time I smelled it, unfortunately I never saw it again at the store, so when I saw the products online I had to have!! Leaves me feeling sweet and happy when I put it on.",1
"I HAVE MANAGED COSMETIC COUNTERS FOR A HIGH END STORE FOR YEARS NOW AND AM A TRUE MAKE-UP HOUND. I'VE TRIED IT ALL...I WAS A BIT LEARY OF THIS PRODUCT, EVEN THOUGH I LOVE KAT VON D, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OK. I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE COLORS. THEY GO ON TRUE TO COLOR, THEY DON'T CRUMBLE OR FLAKE. COLOR LASTS ALL DAY AND I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THEM THAT I TOOK THEM TO MY GIRLS AT THE COUNTERS ( EVEN OTHER LINES!) AND SHOWED THEM. THEY WERE IMPRESSED AS WELL !! WAY TO GO KAT...SEXY AND BEAUTIFUL PALLET.!!!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT ELSE SHE COMES OUT WITH AS I'LL BE FIRST IN LINE TO BUY!!!!! P.S. GREAT PRICE TOO. ",3
"I have medium brown combination skin that tans easily and is prone to acne. Vinoperfect made my skin lighter and prevents the acne scars from showing. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, clear and moisturized (though its not a moisturizer). On days when I'm indoors, this serum is all that I use - you dont need anything else!",1
i have medium to light skin and this is a great bronzer year-round. ands perfect color in the summer when im tan and just the right amount in the winter with no sun. i like the sparkles and no streaks. only problem is the can is pretty small and doesnt last very long. ,1
"I have mixed feelings about it because the results aren't consistent. For eyeliner, this only works part of the time; I agree with another reviewer who has mentioned it taking color off upon application. Sometimes, however, it's ok and does work well as a sealant, but only for eyeliner. I've had horrible results trying to use it to seal eyeshadow and lipstick; a sticky and then clumpy mess - yuck! For just occasional success with only eyeliner, I'd say this is too expensive. I've had great success using Urban Decay's glitter liners as eyeliner sealants; used over eyeliner, it seals the color in and stays there until you take it off. It's your call! ",1
"I have ""muzzle rosacea,"" which is breakouts around the mouth and broken capillaries around the nose. My dermatologist told me that I could wear any makeup as long as it was oil free. I had been wearing mineral foundation during the Spring and Summer, but with these Chicago Winters' extreme cold, my skin was so dry that the mineral foundation would not adhere. (I am caucasian, with fair-to-medium toned skin with golden undertones. I have dark brown hair that is about 25% gray. Despite the breakouts, my skin is dry, and during the winter it tends to get flaky.) I use the Light shade of Sheer Focus, but I put a thin layer of Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion under it. If I didn't put any make-up on in the morning, I will re-hydrate my skin with some Clinique Moisture Surge Extra and then put on the Sheer Focus. I use the Smashbox stick concealer under my eyes. The Sheer Focus coverage is just enough to even out the skin tone and provide enough coverage for any breakout that I may have in the chin/mouth area, as well as cover any redness around the nose. It contains no irritants (including no parabens). Fingertip application is a big plus when you are in a hurry to get out in the morning. ",3
"I have naturally fairly long/thick lashes (dark), and like giving them the extra boost to ""BAM!"" lashes. L'extreme is really stunning, visually. Gave me long, feathery lashes. Not a lot in the volume dept, but definitely length, and it held a curl decently. The reason I gave it a score of 3 stars is because it flaked all over my face. ",0
"I have naturally long, full lashes, so I never thought about using more than a drugstore mascara. Then I received a sample of this. Wow! I have to be careful (it's easy to over do), but with just a light touch, my lashes look fantastic all day. ",3
"I have never been one to wear glitter, but I thought I would give this product a try over the holidays. It goes on very easily. I love the fact that it's not over the top glitter, just a light glitter effect. I received a huge amount of compliments when wearing it. I got the stalkerrazi color and the black one and I love them both, but they do look very similar when on. ",3
"I have never been too fond of blushes, they never worked well with me but a little while back someone said i needed some color in my face and after trying some of the blushes i had lying around i finally decided to get this. I LOVE IT! first i thought the color was way too bright and pink but after testing it i feel in love with it and i wouldn't trade it for any other blush.",0
I have never received so many complaments on a perfume! Everytime I wear this someone always ask what it is and where to find it. A little does go a long way and it lasts forever. Better to smell like sweets than to eat them!,1
"I have never seen brushes this small. I agree with the others. It's a nice kit, but all extra small sizes, and mine were no more than half full. For the price I feel that the products should have been a larger size like the Ruby kit. ",3
"I have never seen such a beautiful glow in a bottle! I feel so goddess like when I wear this. It's sooo pretty and lasts a long time. I love wearing it when I go for the natural look. I really don't see it if I apply a foundation over it or pressed powder, so sometimes I carefully apply a tad more over my make up...BUT BLEND QUICKLY! ",0
"I have never used a face primer, but I was curious about what it does. I have oily skin and this product made my face completely matte and gives you that picture perfect look for your face. If you are a beginner to makeup this primer will be the only one you'll use for a long time.",0
I have never used a primer--and was stunned at the difference this makes!! I am so glad I had all the reviews to guide me in what one to purchase. I had just bought some eyeshadow I love--but it would not stay on more than a few hours--it looks perfect right now TEN hours after I applied it! ,2
"I have never used a primer before this one, so I don't have any other product to compare it to. With that said, I can tell a dramatic difference without it. The very first time I used this was on a Saturday night before going out. When I came home I had no creases in my eye shadow. I've been using it for three days now and LOVE it even more now than that first night. This is a definite must buy!! ",0
"I have never used a self tanner before and I was really nervous to try it. This one is awesome. No streaking. The color is great, no orange. The smell isnt bad and not strong. Looks very natural. Dries super fast! So easy to get off the palms of your hands too! A+! ",0
"I have never used Laura Mercier before but had heard good things about her tinted moisturizer. This was a great way to try everything at a reasonable price. I have fair shin so I bought the fair. The colors match great, I love the sponge and velour puff. Makes my skin look flawless and it stays on for an entire 12 hour work day with minimal oilyness. ",2
"I have never worn a perfume and felt like I have transgressed into a wonderland! Fresh, clean, soft floral, sexy. I receive complements all day! Bottle half gone I love it so much! My favorite. Men LOVE this. Want to try Amazing Grace next... Remember friends at Xmas!",4
"I have never worn perfume because I usually find it jarring on other woman but my boyfriend bought me this as a gift and I love it. When I wear it women guess the fragrance because it's so good they know it by name! I have a pretty good nose and I realized the reason I initially loved it so much was because it reminds me of Playdoh (haha), but when it goes on it is very soft and subtle. I am super sensitive to fragrances and couldn't wear it otherwise- it's a really unique and lovely scent.",1
"I have not had the time to use this set as of yet,but the color selection is excellent,and one should be able to mix and match with these 9 color eye shadows for any shade needed to match any outfit. Am looking forward to using these over the x-mas holidays. ",4
"I have not reached a full conclusion to this product, it goes on and blends easily, nice applicator, coverage is light to medium. I am not entirely sure how long lasting it is. I have some broken capillaries around my nose which is my main concealer concern and am always on the lookout for a long lasting concealer that isn't too heavy and doesn't crease. ",4
I have now been through several tubes of this stuff (previously several tubes of other brands) There is no better mascara out there. The formula does condition your lashes every time you use it. Longer fuller beautiful lashes. ,2
"I haven't found a mascara yet that will lengthen, thicken AND hold my lashes after I've curled them...this one does it all! I do use the waterproof version and never have a problem with flaking or smudging. This is the holy grail of mascaras! ",2
"I haven't reviewed a lot of hair products because I can never tell a difference if they actually do what they claim they do, but i have naturally wavy hair and most of the time after I'm done straightening my hair, its very frizzy. When I used this rinse I was amazed at how silky AND shiny my hair was. Now I use it on a daily basis, after I'm done conditioning my hair, I squeeze out all the water and put this rinse in for 2-3 minutes and voila! It's well worth the money if you want smooth shiny hair! ",0
I haven't used any similar products to compare this to but this one definitely does what it claims to do! I've used it twice in the past year and a half and am about to use it again. I notice a big difference in my skin after one week and at the end of the 3-4 week program my skin looks fantastic! This is expensive but worth every penny!! ,3
"I haven't used the original HIAJ, but I love this one! It definitely has a fragrance, so I imagine you'd either love it or hate it - it's very Coppertoney to me, so it's a lovely beachy feel. Don't know if I'll be bummed out by that in the winter, but i doubt it. It does leave me a tad shiny, but it feels great on, and definitely improves my skin's texture, so I like it a great deal. ",2
"I haven't used this enough to know what it would do to my skin (break out or not) but when I have used it, I love the scent on my skin. It kinda wakes me up, so it would be nice to spritz on your facewhen you need a little pick-me-up at work.",1
I haven't worn perfume in about 6 years because I couldn't find anything that I liked and that also smelled great on me. I tried Pink Sugar after I received a sample with one of my Sephora orders. I have absolutely love it! I get compliments all the time!,1
"I have often had a hard time finding a moisturizer that I like. I cannot stand sticky, waxy, thick body creams. I was so happy when a Sephora employee suggested this body cream to me - ensuring me that it was light and not at all thick. She was right and I buy this body cream by the basket full. My only wish is that it was available in a larger size! ",2
"I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin which is hard to please. This product is extremely gentle and milky yet leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, and smooth with just the right amount of hydration. Rub this together in your hands with some water and apply to your wet face for a gentle, yet incredibly affective cleanse. I've tried all kinds of face wash (expensive and in expensive) and this has by far been the best. The make-up optional kit is really doing well for me. If you're on the fence, go with this.",0
"I have oily eyelids and have always had an issue with using eyeshadows and eye pencils. Liquid liner seemed to be the only product that worked (but not every travel friendsly with all the travel/TSA restrictions these days), but no more. This is my ABSOLUTE GO TO eyeliner. I love the fact that it goes on and stays on. Not to mention all the color options. Definitely recommend this product.",1
"I have oily, sensitive skin on my back and chest, and typically cannot use many fragranced liquid soaps. However, I got a sample of this with another purchase and tried it on a romantic weekend with the hubby. I loved it so much, I bought the full-sized version. The scent is heavenly on me, my skin is very soft after using it, and it does not cause any issues like rashes or pimples. The scent left on my skin is very light and lasts most of the day...although that might be in part because my skin is oily and retains more of the scent. ",3
"I have oily skin, and I have tried every mattifying product on the market. This is the first one that has worked all day for me, and I love it. I work long hours and travel frequently, so I need something that works in a variety of climates and for long periods of time. Not only does it control my skin's oil production, I have not had a breakout since I began using it. It creates a fabulously smooth and velvety surface for my makeup, as well. Medi-Matte has SPF 20, so I'm protected whether I'm in Phoenix or Fresno. ",3
"I have oily skin in the summer,and this bronzer is the BEST one I have found that keeps my skin matte all day!Great color for me too.I use the lighter tones during the other seasons for a natural powder. ",2
"I have oily skin on my forehead, chin and nose... cheeks, eyes etc are very dry... so skin care is a bit of an issue. Everything Dr. Brandt makes is amazing. I bought the kit once to try out the products, they are good sized and lasted about 45 days. Unlike most moisturizers for women my age... they are not over the top oily. They are perfectly balanced. I do two pumps of the cleanser each morning (it runs out the fastest of the products). I love the eye cream sample (it lasts about a week). The serum is wonderful and gives smooth palatte to your face. Tne Toner is the best I have used. I use the Lineless face cream around my eyes (when I run out of the eye cream) and I also use it on my lips, cheeks and mouth creases. I do not use it on my chin, nose and forehead (T-zone) areas ... I only use the serum there. This is a perfectly balanced system and I intend to continue using as well as adding some additional firming products of Dr. Brandts. ",3
"I have older, oily skin, and finding a cleanser that removes makeup (including eye liner and mascara) but does not leave my skin too dry or too oily has been a challenge. I like this cleanser because it does all that. It's a powerhouse cleanser that removes all traces of the day and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I only use it at night, I use Bliss Steep Clean Cleansing lotion in my morning shower; however, that should not be used on the eye area, which is why I have been looking for another cleanser. This is much more effective than any other cleasers I have tried. ",3
"I have one eyebrow that grows thinner than the other. I've used a pencil to broaden it and fill a small gap, but it always looked drawn on. This set is wonderful! The powder looks very natural. The brush with the set helps me precisely apply the product, and I'm really happy with the results. Now my eyebrows frame my eyes instead of drawing attention away from them. ",3
"I have one of these stashed in all different places in the house as well as one in my office and in my purse. I can't be without it. It's great on my lips, but also fabulous for dry patches on my hands. I just love this stuff.",3
I have only been using this for about 3 weeks. I have seen very small results as of yet-but i will continue to use as directions state and hope for much more improvement-I don't think I have really used it long enough but I did not see the quick or instant result as stated ,3
"I have only tried this for a short time, after trying what seems like everything else. It's pretty good. I have combination skin -- even at a ""certain age"" which means way over 50! Keeping my nose from shining is a battle. My skin absolutely eats make-up. I give this a good rating, but the final verdict is still out. Anyone else?",4
"I have only used the black one, but I think this is a great eyeliner. Compared to other eyeliners, it comes on much more smoothly and richly and does not smudge as much. The color is a nice rich, dark black and it's so small yet useful you can take it with you anywhere. It never dries out and lasts quite a long time. ",1
I have only used this product once but I really like it. I have really full and pigmented lips and lipsticks dont generally bleed but the skin is very sensitive so they just get a red rim. I first apply Tartes concealer b/c it soothes the irritation and then trace this pencil right on top and it keeps the shape and redness down all day. I like how it comes with its own pencil sharpener as well. ,0
I have ordered this product twice in the past year. It is another stay on eye product. My eyelids sweat and here in California that means eye shadow doesn't stay put. I didn't think I would like metallic but it is great. I love it. ,4
"I have paid three figures for makeup brushes that are neither as well-constructed or as flawlessly performing as this brush. I use it for my loose powder; it allows me a more controlled application. that is the testament of a great brush- it is a multi-tasker. what makes this brush so special are the bristles. natural hair bristles can be a scratchy, shedding nightmare. these are heavenly soft and Sephora is unwaveringly generous with their brush making in that the bristles are all quality and are densely-packed. the bristles are also skillfully trimmed. I am a painter as well as a 'productfiend' so I have bought many kinds of brushes; in my experience, Sephora's brushes rival and surpass any three-digit department store brush in both quality and performance. I used to be a counter manager for a big cosmetics line known for their brushes, and was given many to use at home. I can tell you this: Sephora's brushes have out-lived AND out-shined these other very pricey brushes. I am gradually replacing all of my brushes with Sephora brand. these brushes make the difference between a fair makeup application and one that is stunning. I, for one, am lucky and thankful that Sephora provides such wonderful tools to us all. ",2
"I have painfully dry skin all year long. I have tried EVERYTHING on the market to help soothe it and keep the little moisture I do have intact. I have found with regular use that this product keeps my skin soft, moisture trappd and smelling wonderful. This product is my favorite and certainly worth the cost. It's especially great on feet, FRESH Body Polish is simply amazing!",2
I have pale skin and always searching for a pretty nude lipstick. This is just the right shade. I sometimes mix it with a richer pink lipstick for the perfect hue. This lipstick can be worn alone or with other shades. ,2
"I have pretty terrible skin, so I will generally try anything. But this wasn't for me. I was trying to get away from all the harsh chemical face cleansers, but this was just too mild for skin as bad as mine. I also prefer a foamy face wash, I didn't care for the milkiness of this one.",0
"I have purchased both palettes of Kat Von D eyeshadows. The packaging is incredibly girlie and very cool, but WOW! the shadows....they are gorgeous! I received a myriad of compliments from co-workers and friends. The shadows are easy to apply, have a wonderful finish and are truly smoky and sexy. Keep the Kat Von D products coming! I'm sold! ",3
I have purchased Spackle twice before and will continue to do so. It's a lightweight cream that smooths out my skin for a great make-up application. It just glides on. This product is in an air pump thus giving you every last drop. It's also great for traveling. ,4
"I have purchased this product more than once, and I have definitely seen results. And the steps for applying the product seem to help create better results. I have used other firming products, and so far this is the best I have tried. ",1
"I have purchased thousands of eyeliners in my life and, by far, this is the best. I have trouble with tearing as I have sensitive eyes, and this does not move. After a long day ( I work 12 hour shifts) it does tend to lighten in the outer corners of my eyes but that is minimal. I highly recommend this product. I've only tried the black...but I will have to look into the other colors!",1
"I have really bad dark circles which are almost impossible to cover up. Lemon-Aid helps me cover up my dark circles pretty well. I use it everyday, even if I don't wear make up and just wanna cover up my dark circles. ",0
I have really dry hands from excess washing. Sometimes my hands get so dried out that they start to crack and peel. I bought this hand cream in the sample size first to try it out and I was absolutely AMAZED. I immediately bought the full size as soon as I could (my next stop at the mall.) This is by far the best hand cream I have ever tried. My hands were softer than I thought possible and my cracked and peeling hands healed up within a few days and have stayed that way since. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft touchable hands. Thank you again Bliss! ,1
I have really oily skin and I have a problem with shadows creasing. You just need a small amount and it covers the whole lid! So this product is going to last me forever! It is so quick and easy to apply and comes in beautiful colors. I got the nude sparkle and it was so pretty on. It also works nice as a base for other shadows. ,0
I have really oily skin and the gel is perfect to use before or after makeup application! Normally I don't use moisturizer but it is perfect for the winter months when everything chaps up a little. It even feels really nice on your hands!,0
I have really sensitives skin and I can't just use any kind of cleanser. The old cleansers that I used to you woul ddry out my skin and irritate it. IBut once I swtiched to Boscia it was so gentle on my skin. I use it everyday and it keeps my skin clean and soft. I don't have the sensitive skin problems that I used to have anymore. I love it!,1
"I have recently been using this in my makeup kit as an alternative to MAC blot powder and I am very happy & impressed with the results. It blots oil, without adding color to the skin and it looks very natural in person and on TV! There are 3 color choices, but I wish there were more, maybe a light/medium combination. It's a little expensive, but it does do the job! ",3
I have red hair but my brows are a very light blonde. For a long time I didn't define my brows because pencils always looked fake. This powder is the BEST! The have the best red color in Auburn and the powder will last through anything and always look natural. ,2
"I have relatively tame hair to begin, but using this cream makes my hair look straight up fabulous. It makes it super glossy and shiny, and it also smells really nice. I also live in Miami where the humidity level is always insane, yet this cream still keep my frizz totally under control. One bottle also lasts a really long time because you only need to apply a pea-sized amount at a time. ",0
"I have rosacea, and this peel is wonderful. It is great for sensitive skin and calms the rosacea. I think it is the best peel that Philosophy makes. Most of their other peels are too harsh for my skin. So, gals, if you have sensitive skin, this one is great for you. ",4
"I have rosacea and with bareMinerals I am able to cover it without looking made up. It is truly natural looking and I even feel better, smile bigger and have more fun. It has really made a difference in my makeup time and expense. All for the better",4
"I have searched for many years to find a bronzer that was not too orange or too brown for my fair skin. The Lorac Bronzer in ""Warm"" is perfect! It gives just the right amount of glow and shimmer without a lot of color. I use it year-round. It can also double as an eyeshadow if you are stretched for time. On the weekends I sweep it over my entire face - with a bit of concealer, mascara and gloss and I'm good to go. It costs a bit more than I usually like to spend on a single product, but the compact lasts a long time and the shade is worth every penny! Definitely recommend! ",3
I have searched for years for an oil-free moisturizer that provides just the right amount of moisture (especially in the summer) but that also has sunscreen and doesn't make me breakout. THIS IS IT. This product is ultra-lite but absorbs into the skin so quickly and provides great moisture. Thank you for answering my prayers DDF! ,2
I have searched high and low for a brow powder that looks natural. I finally found the answer. It covers the gray in my brows and looks completely natural. This product applies easily with any brow brush.,3
"I have sensitive and oily skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all. It covers up all the oily spots with only a couple of strokes, sometimes I dab some extra powder just underneath my eyes to hide the dark circles. ",1
"I have sensitive skin and don't love cleansers that will dry my skin out, or that is so harsh it makes my skin over-produce oil. This cleanser helps with both. The light bubbly sensation when cleansing makes me want to just wash my face all day long, it's so calming! Boscia is my favorite skincare line, and of all their cleansers, this one works best for my combination skin.",1
"I have sensitive skin w/some rosacea & some blotchiness. After trying just about all anti-aging creams, sensitive skin creams, anti-wrinkle creams, skin perfecting creams,, including La Mer,.....I have found Kinerase to be the absolute BEST! Been using it for 9 years & my skin looks even & amazing!! ",3
"I have sesitive skin that tends to breakout with heavy moisturizers. This is lightweight, helps my makeup cover well and does not irritate my skin. I use it even after applying acne cream to keep the irritation down. ",2
"I have several colors of blush, but Dallas is my all time favorite. It is so perfect with any colors that you are wearing. It can highlight like a bronzer, contour and just illuminate your attributes. ",3
I have several of these and love the Strawberry fudge the most. It is a great Iridescent shade of pink with a great brown. I have blended them and uses separately. The best is that this is not chalky. ,4
"I have so many BE eye shadows but this has been my favorite for years,I bought this to go to the beach with me and fell in love with it and haven't worn any thing else.Its perfect for me because I have brown eyes.I have gotten alot of compliments since wearing this. ",3
"I have so many BE products, kits, etc. Love Leslie's brushes, love the pureness of the minerals she uses. They are all actually good for your skin. Remember she was the first to come up with the mineral makeup. Many others have tried to copy, but they aren't up to Leslie's standards! ",4
I have so many of these I can spell NARS 2 1/2 times - LOL. It's amazing how uniquely beautiful the colors look on almost everyone. The textures are true to description and non-drying. Sometimes I use NARS Rain as a lip base and it really enhances the color. Even Rain on its own gives lips a beautiful ethereal look. I love lipstick and NARS has earned its place at the top my list of faves!,2
"I have some pretty significant sun damage on my fair skin. I have tried many, many concealers in my quest to cover these dark areas without the concealer looking cakey or obvious; to have the product last throughout the day; and to match my in-between warm and cool skin tone. having tried other Make Up Forever products, and liking their performance, I decided to give this product a try. this is a serious, very opaque concealer. this is a good thing, because it's easy to add a bit more if you need more coverage, but a product that isn't as concentrated just won't hide those flaws. you only need the tiniest bit of this concealer to cover blemishes or redness, and it even covers my dark sun spots. I apply it with an artificial bristle brush- I like Sephora's Large Synthetic Eyeshadow Brush #25. the synthetic bristles are perfect for applying this concealer. I prefer a wider brush to a smaller concealer brush, as I can cover a larger area with less product. after I apply my concealer, I add a light dusting of MUF's HD Microfinish Powder to set the Camouflage Cream. this product is going to last me a long time, so I put a smidge of it into a smaller container to carry in my makeup bag so I can keep the original container in the fridge to prolong its life. that's how concentrated it is! there is a great range of colors, too. if you have struggled to find a concealer that will really conceal, as I have, give this product a try. ",2
"I have somewhat dry hair, so I use this when I want to extend a blowout for a few days. I use it at night before I go to bed and when I brush it out the next day, my hair looks awesome and fresh. I hate traveling overseas with converters, dryers, etc. so this is a great alternative when you're going away for a few days. ",3
"I have sooo much foundation that I use once. This is great option for those days when less is more face-wise. I like the smooth, easily blended coverage. I am fair with yellow under-tones and the Natural suits me at the end of summer. ",4
"I have Sophia, which is supposed to be a cool brown. Hmmm. I have a cool complexion; very pale with blue undertones (and dark brown eyes and medium brown hair), and this shadow does not look good on me. ""Sophia"" seems to me to have yellow or reddish undertones. It also never applies evenly. I've used it with and without a primer and no matter what, it smudges and smears and is just a disappointment to me. ",2
I have sparse/short eyelashes and this mascara seems to work the best for me to bring out every lash that I have without looking clumpy. It is worth the extra pennies because you don't have to use that much. ,3
"I have spent much more on facial moisterizers, this is just as good! I t is non greasy and works well to protect my skin during the day...I also use it at night! Best pick for getting the most for your money! Perfect! ",3
I have stick straight hair and I tried spraying it and curling it with my fingers and it didn't really do anything. It could be for after you curl your hair with a curling iron. It smells great though!! ,0
"I have stick-traight lashes, and after using this I still have stick-straight lashes. I'm glad it works for other folks, but there must be some lashes that just won't curl. (My hair is stick-straight too, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised!) ",3
"I have strayed only a few times, but I continue to go back to Airflash. It is my exact match, looks flawless, and I don't have to worry about it looking airbrushed, because, it is!\nI use this and then buff out lightly with a large kabuki and it's like I have the best skin ever.",1
"I have super curly hair that is kind of fine. I tried this product because I heard Fekkai makes really great products for curly hair. It smells great and did control my frizz, but it also seemed to alter the structure of my curls a little bit. It didn't do exactly what I hoped it would but I still thinks it's a decent product. I would guess it depends on your hair type. ",1
"I have switched from cleanser to cleanser and have never been able to find one I can settle down with. Ever since a friend of my gave me a sample of Purity - I finally found ""The One."" My skin is typically dry in the cheek area and oily in the t-zone and this works wonders. It removes make up (even eye make up) and leaves my skin feeling amazingly clean. I follow it up with Hope in a Jar for Dry and Sensitive Skin - and my skin has never looked or felt better.",1
I have switched from SmashBox to Spackle and love it. It absorbs quickly and keeps my makeup looking fresh all day. I have used it with Laura's mineral products and with my liquid foundation and it is great. ,4
"I have the Citrus Sage scent, and I love it. Not overpowering and perfumey, just clean and refreshing. It lathers well and doesn't dry out my skin. I subtracted a star because the cap is a little tough to open with wet fingernails. It isn't enough to stop me from trying new scents... I'll just leave them open. ",1
"I have the color Red 30 and I love it! It smells and tastes yummy, is long lasting, moisturizing and has such a deep, rich color that my boyfriend loves! It helps that I love it too, of course. I'm definitely going to buy this again! ",0
"I have the entire line of Bare Escentuals. They are great.\nThis blush, though, is a little too metallic and I have to be\nvery careful to barely touch my cheeks or it goes on too heavy, even with blowing the excess powder out of the brush.",4
"I have the hardening and strengthening serum, and it is hands down the best I've used. I usually have the problem of clear polish flaking off within a day of applying it. This stays on for at least a week and adds a nice shine as well. It's great over and under other polish as well! ",1
"I have the larger tube for my bathroom, and the smaller one for my purse. This hand lotion moisturizes well and absorbs quickly, and it's not too greasy. It has a very light scent that does not overwhelm or interfere with other products. The SPF is a great bonus. ",0
"I have thick, but really fine shoulder length hair. This is one of the best products I have found that really gives my hair some texture and body. As the other reviewers have said, just use a tiny amount, rub it in your hands really good and then use it on sections of your hair. Not only does it work great, but it smells like coconut and the container will last you forever. ",3
"I have thick, course hair and Phyto Relaxing Balm works beautifully. It does not leave a sticky residue and works from one shampoo until the next. I have used it for more than 4 years now and wouldn't give it up! Even my hair stylist asked what I was using on my hair! ",3
"I have thin lips and use glosses that are lighter in color. These glosses are beautiful, sheer colors. They feel good and look good even the darkest one. If you like glosses, this is for you. Color and texture are nice and the application lasts a long time. ",3
"i have this blush in Exhibit A, which a wicked orangey-red color and it looks AMAZING!!! I have dark skin and its impossible for me to find a blush that doesn't make me look dull or ""ashey."" the color perfect for day and night AND the texture of the blush is so fine that it just blends in with my own skin texture. i never break out from it, which has been a problem with other blushes for me. I where it almost EVERYDAY and it still hasn't run out. Its amazing.",0
"I have this blush in Orgasm, and it is my favourite blush I have tried!! It gives a natural glow, and works perfectly for my fair skin - it's not too bright, but definitely noticeable. This gives my skin a nice sun-kissed glow.",0
"I have this blush in Orgasmm & love it! It's the perfect color for my skin tone & many others, and adds a natual glow to my face. It is very pigmented, so a little goes a long way making this product last for a while.",0
"I have this gloss in a few colors and especially love Chantaco and Sandpiper... the consistency is nice and not sticky, no strong scent, colors are pretty and flattering... this is a tough gloss to beat because it's so good and it's not terribly overpriced. ",3
"I have this gloss in ""lust"" which is a warm shimmery deep pink, it's really pretty but I guess sephora isn't carrying it anymore. :( At any rate, this gloss isn't too thick or sticky and it really is nice and smooth. ",0
"I have this gloss in Precious Pink, and it's really subtle and pretty. It smells and tastes kind of like bubble gum and cotton candy, which at first I thought I would really hate. Luckily, it's actually not overpowering, which is nice. I was going to buy a much more expensive Chanel gloss before I tried this, and I'm glad that I didn't! The Sephora gloss is a lot cheaper, and just as lovely! It goes on sleek and once it has absorbed a little, makes my lips feel soft and moisturized. ",0
"I have this in #75 and I absolutely love it. It is so creamy and moist and full of color and very shiny! I use it all the time, I hope this is not going to be discontinued because this is a great lipstick. ",2
"I have this in Bleu Marine, and the color is great for blue eyes! I apply it with a wet flat eyeliner brush *under* my lash line (not on the lid). I would have given it 5 stars, but the color is not as vibrant as I would like and it tends to wear off by the end of the day. ",0
"I have this in Brazil and love it. It can be used in a variety of ways...not just one specific application. Sometimes I use just the cream alone and other times the powder; then, I might follow the instructions and use both as described. Any way you decide to use it, it is a great product and you will love it. ",3
i have this in budapest and its perfect for creating a smoky eye. its not overwhelmingly dark. at first i wasnt sure what to do with the cream liner but with a little experimenting i found it to be a great eyeliner and great for smudging. i use this every time i go out at night ,0
I have this in bunny which is a nice peachy nude color that I wear almost everyday. My lips are already pretty full but this makes them look even plumper and the color is perfect for a natual day look. Also tastes and smells yummy! I can't wait to try other shades. ,1
"I have this in Cherry Lane, Sweet Samba, and Happy Ending (not listed here). Cherry Lane is a nice bright pink, leaning towards the red side. Sweet Samba is a very low-key and demure shimmery nude. Happy Ending is a bright coral/pink that makes me feel like a Disney Princess with it on, lol. The lipstick is way too soft for use straight from the tube (most of the time) unless used very gently with no pressure against your lips. I bought a travel lip brush that is small and comes with a case, and I brush the lipstick right out of the tube and apply. It is the creamiest lipstick that I have ever tried! I love lipstick by Urban Decay, Nars, and even L'Oreal, but this has the creamiest, dreamiest texture! I still gave it 5 stars despite the softness due to the fact that the quality of the lipstick on your lips more than makes up for the color stick bending in the tube. I'm definitely interested in trying more colors! ",0
"I have this in clear and I am so glad I came across this product. My eyebrows aren't too unruly to begin with, but this still keeps my brows in place. You can't tell that you aren't wearing anything, but it leaves your brows glossy. The gel stays put until you wash it out and it doesn't flake.",0
"I have this in Dolce Vita, and it's such a beautiful shade!! It's a medium rose-red shade. The staying power of the pencil is excellent, and although it's matte, the texture is creamy and comfortable. Topped with gloss, it looks even better!!",1
"I have this in five colors- from basic black to the bright blue. It goes on smoothly, almost gel-like - gives you enough time to perfect it, -blending into lash line or smudging -and then sets for a lovely long lasting finish. ",2
"I have this in Jasmine and it has to be my favorite. I love how my bathroom will smell like flowers for hours after I get out of the shower. It's not over powering, maybe that's also because Jasmine is my favorite flower. ",1
"I have this in Lunar Brown, which is a brown/nude-ish pink. It's very natural looking and perfect for the office. (Peach blush and brown toned eye shadows complete my polished, professional look.) It's creamy and moisturizing without being waxy. ",1
"I have this in Midnight Brown and Blue Black. The color of the liners are amazingly rich. The liners themselves are easy to apply and blended but doesn't last that long at all! Even smudging eyeshadow over them didn't make them last any longer. :( If it was only long-wear, then the product would be amazing. Maybe the Jet-Set liner is better... ",0
"I have this in rosegold and it really has way too much glitter for me. It works well as a base, though...stays put and adds luminosity when other shades are applied over it to tone down the glitter. Maybe I will try a deeper shade to see if that works better for me. The rosegold, when worn alone just looks like a light bronze glitter on me. ",3
"I have this in Sheer Gold. This is beautiful alone, but I normally put it over any lipstick I want to ""dress"" a bit. The sparkle looks classy, not cheap. If you apply over lipstick, be sure to put this on your hand from the applicator, then apply with a lip brush, unless you don't mind getting existing lipstick color on the applicator and thus into the contatiner. This is perfect for holidays, too. ",4
"I have this in Spotlight Coral 530 and absolutely love it. I have very fair skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. It's a wonderful coral without being too orange. I get compliments whenever I wear it. It's moisturizing and long wearing with great shine. ",0
"I have this in tansoleil and the color is perfect. This cream blush goes on evenly and looks so natural. After trying many gel and cream blushes, I have finally found the best. I have no problem at all with the container as many other reviewers stated. It is easy to get on my index finger and blends very well. I would recommend this to everyone! ",3
I have this in the infamous orgasm. It is the most flattering peachy color. I even use as an all over highlighter to give my pale skin a glow. Equally great for a daytime look or a sultry flush for a night on the town just intensify the amount you apply for differing looks,0
"I have this is in Patina, which is a pretty shimmery shade of very light green that make my brown eyes pop. I like to use the powder end alone because it gives such a soft beautiful effect that never looks over done, even with a bright lipstick. The cream is rich and I tried to apply straight from the tube once and got too much product! Use your fingers for a more even appllication and don't use too much. When I use both together, the color is always rich and creaseless. ",0
"I have this lip balm and it was immediately my favorite. It is a must have, goes on smooth, just a hint of color, smells great and is not sticky. TAstes good too! This is a great lip balm. and must have for fall! ",3
"I have this lip gloss in several colors, but Bronze Beauty is by far my favorite. I will be getting married in 3 weeks and it is the lip gloss I will use on my wedding date. It has a hint of color and shine, glides on smoothly, and is not sticky at all. Love it! ",1
"I have this lip pencil in Cruella - a blood red that is absolutely divine. The pencil really is velvety smooth - application is a breeze, and this thing is packin' some MAJOR pigment, kids. It's like the lip pencil equivalent of a Sharpie marker. I even smudge a little on my pointer finger and use as a blush stain on the apples of my cheeks - with my super fair skin, it gives just the right rosy glow. I could not live without this pencil.",1
"I have this lipstick in ""Fresh Brown."" Normally I would not go for a brown tinged lip color, but after trying this color/lipstick, I'm very delighted. I have super fair skin, darkish eyes and brown hair and generally, I go for pinks and such. This color, however, looks absolutely fab on me. While the color is called ""Fresh Brown,"" it does not wear brown at all. It really just darkens and defines my lips and looks fairly natural (but better!) The lipstick itself is light as a feather, very creamy and hydrating and it seems to last a good while. I would highly recommend this product! (And don't be scared of the fresh brown, its lovery!!!) ",1
"I have this lipstick in Grace. It's a nice color, a little pale, but overall pretty. This formula is great if you love all natural ingredients and such, but the only down side is that it's not that creamy, and a little grainy on your lips. ",0
"I have this product in ""illume,"" (I use this on top of Sephora Brand Lip Attitude - Chic Lipstick in ""Luxury Beige."") which creates a nude but shimmery look. The lip gloss gives you pouty look, without making your lips feeling sticky and uncomfotable. ",1
"I have this product in sexmachine. It is to die for, the color is absolutely beautiful and my husband makes a comment every time I wear it. I was a little bit worried that it might dry out but it doesn't it actually lasts a long time despite the smoothness of it all. The only down fall is that I love it so much it is disappearing quickly! The NARS pencil sharpener eats away the stick so much it hurts when I clean up the sharpener.",1
"I have this shadow in Juniper and Rose Pebble and just love the colors and the finish. The sheen is subtle and does not look dry or too glimmery. I actually use the two together for a soft, light color combination. ",3
"I have three of these lip glosses and really like them... Chihuahua is my favorite, then Foul Play and Striptease. I suggest looking through the colors in person at the store because some are a bit too glittery and pearly for my taste. ",1
"I have tired ALL the plumpers, and this is the ONLY one which I carry with me. YES, it will sting and YES it will dry out your lips, BUT, using a lip balm over it takes careot it, no prob! And it's worth it, by far!!! ",3
"I have to admit, I first saw this product on a home shopping channel and heard the host raving about it. I thought ""how can a cleanser be so great that this chick is raving about it???"" Well, here I am raving about it. What I love about this product is it gives a thorough cleansing without irritating my skin. I used Cetaphil for a long time but sometimes felt that it wasn't totally taking off my makeup. Purity Made Simple has the gentleness of Cetaphil with the oomph of a more harsh cleanser. I use it morning and night and love it.",1
"I have to admit I LOVE buying limited edtion sets and this one is a good one to get ! I have read reviews before about BE customers saying that alot of the colors tend to be too sheer and un-noticable , which I admit they are sheer and some of my sets do look alot alike but this one is VERY dramatic and bold ,the blush can be a bit dark but great on my tan skin and the new buxom is soo amazing that I bought the 6 new colors , and this Ruby is not too dark but a very strong color and the fact that it is full color it's more intense than the other buxoms and last longer and I am VERY impressed cuz I do lick my lips ALOT and it stays on !!!!!!!! Last but not least it's a GREAT VALUE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",2
"I have Tobago and love it! It works well as a lipstick and a blush in a pinch. I do not like the waxy, plastic smell and wish they would create a more soothing aroma. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",2
"I have to disagree with most of the reviews and say that this product did not do much for my clogged pores and mild acne. I did like that it did not dry my skin out like some acne products, but I would not say it is 'exfoliating'. I like to try to give skin care products some time to work, but I have wasted too much money on this product. ",0
"I have to give four stars based on the wide selection alone. Upon opening I was like a kid at Christmas with ""The Big Box"" of Crayolas - which should I use first! Agree the lip gloss is hard and a little difficult to use but I find the e/s is long lasting and crease proof on me! It's a joy to decide each day what kind of look I want to create! ",4
"I have to give Nars credit for their fantastic selection of colors (and color names). I got the 0rgasm blush after falling in love with the Multiple 0rgasm and it is positively the best blush color I own. The color is natural and looks good with everything I own.\nThat said, I wish they would cut back on the sparkle. I'm not a teenager anymore.",1
"I have to say I really love this palette. They wear well, and the greys are neutral with no yellow undertone. I also like the highlight shade, as so many grey palettes will include a highly frosted or too stark white highlighter. The original Stilo Smoky Eyes is also a big favorite as well. Great product! ",3
"I have to say that I love this pencil -- and the little blending sponge is sheer genius!! It covers everything from dark circles to blemishes, blends beautifully, and somehow manages to look natural. I am not a fan of all Geller products, but this one really works! ",2
"I have to say that these nail polishes are excellent. They have great coverage, dry quickly and last a long time. The only thing is that I am a little dissapointed with the color Metro Chic. I had heard all these wonderful reviews on it and don't get me wrong, the color is beautiful, but I feel like I had seen this before. Actually I think I even had it before. But again, these are all fabulous colors, and I can't wait to get some more. ",1
"I have tried 2 other lancome mascaras, definicil and hypnose, and are very satisfied with them. I'm quite satisfied with this new one as well. Coats every lash, wears long, and is easily removed with make up remover. The only negative thing is it makes my lashes look a little dry. ",0
"I have tried all kinds of sharpeners and this is absolutley the best. It is a great size, feels good in your hand, sharpens fast and even and I love the end caps and the sharpener caps, easy to open and clean. ",3
"I have tried all the Mascaras....Dior Show is the Best!! I have sensitive eyes and this mascara does not irritate. It never clumps or smears and curls lashes, while adding volume and length!!! You've got to try it! ",2
"I have tried a lot of brow products, I am halfway through my second tube. Yes I see results as new growth, although slow. The condition of the brow is much improved & much more manageable. I give it 3 stars due to the growth being so slow, but this is the best product of this kind I have tried also. ",3
"I have tried a lot of different eye makeup removers because I have very sensitive skin and tend to get rashes around my eyes. This one works very well with just one swipe of the cotton ball and minimal tugging/pulling around the eyes. Also, I love the mild rosewater fragrance, and best of all, no rashes!",1
I have tried a lot of different products to get rid of the little bumps that I often get on the back of my legs and arms. Nothing seemed to work. I saw this on a website and decided to give it a try! It works MAGIC!!!,1
"I have tried a lot of eye creams, but this one COMPLETELY softened and diminished all those little lines under my eyes along my lower lash line. It doesn't irritate my eyes, which tend to be sensitive, and as stated in the description, it really is everything you'll ever need in an eye cream! ",3
"I have tried a lot of face washes over the years, and I really like this one. It is a gentle but effective daily face wash. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone, and this product cleans my face without drying it out. I usually alternate this with a pore cleanser, deep cleaning face wash every couple days to keep blackheads and acne at bay.",1
"I have tried a lot of light foundations and tinted moisterizers, and this is my favorite hands down. It offers a touch more coverage that most moisterizers, but is sheer, natural , and layerable. Perfect for combo or oily skin that tends to break out. People will just think you have naturally radiant skin. ",2
"i have tried a million different eyeliners all claiming to be the best, this one actually is. it lasts all day and glides on super easily. you do have to use eye makeup remover to get it off and i have not tried it on my waterline, but judging by how resistant it is when i wash my face i would assume it would be great!",0
"I have tried a number of ""almost makeups"" and tinted moisturizers, and this is definitely not one of my faves. It had a far-out expiration date but was almost separated in the tube. Did not go on evenly. I much prever Tarte's version. ",3
"I have tried dozens and dozens of brow products over the years. I've used brow powders, pencils of all descriptions, and powders with a setting component. I've tried brow 'mascara.' in short, this product is absolutely THE BEST BROW PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED. I have naturally black hair with a red undertone, and I use the Medium Ash shade. I find that I look a little younger if my brows are a bit lighter than my hair color. this product is buildable, and you only need to use the tiniest bit. I have had my Brow Pomade for over three years and it's barely used. I hope they never [knocking wood] discontinue this product. I use Sephora slanted brush #10 for flawless and easy application. finished brows are a must for even a 'no makeup' look. Anastasia's Brow Pomade makes it easy for all of us to have flawless brows. I HIGHLY recommend this product. ",2
"I have tried dozens of anti-frizz products to attempt to get my frizzy, year old perm, long thick hair to stay frizz free. This product keeps the frizz down for a little bit. I live in very humid Arkansas and this has not been able to fight the humidity. Even when I chi my hair, it's still frizzy a few hours later. ",0
"I have tried dozens of mascaras, really just looking for something that quickly lengthened and thickened my lashes without looking trashy. Dior mascara does that. It doesn't smudge, but it comes off easily. It can be a day mascara for work or add a few more coats for evening. It is versatile, reliable and fun! ",2
I have tried every bronzeer there is. I have fair skin and this is the best I have ever had and the only one I have not returned! It looks natural no orange sparkly glow. I now am tring the rest of her line and love what i have tried! ,3
"I have tried every foundation and formula on earth and I have to say I LOVE this! I use it as foundation, over tinted moisture, as touch up during day or even over her Phenomenal liquid foundation. The original (med.) was dark on me but I could still buff it to look soft, natural. BUT The Fair is 'IT!"" It ISN'T shiny, glittery, chalky, or in ANY way unnatural! It's a creamy powder that looks like great skin and can use extra on spots for cover. I can't use it under eye (wrinkles :() So I pat a creaseless creamy concealer there, PERFECTION. SO glad NO FAKE china doll porcelain looking skin or dryness! No flat look, NO MESS! featherlight! BEST multi use item EVER! No glitter, just pretty radiant skin! ",4
"I have tried every kind of makeup that is supposed to stay on all day, and this is by far my favorite. The texture of it is silky, it feels like it's not even on your skin, like it becomes your skin. It blends seamlessly. I wish I could buy more, but they are sold out! I'm afraid they wont have it again...eeeeeek ",1
"I have tried every product on the market for my dry, coarse cuticles and this is by far the best. I buy 2 at a time, one for my car and one for my nightstand. I have been an addict for at least 2 years. ",3
"I have tried everything during the summer and still end up wet, and by the end of the day not so fresh. This smells clean going on then disappears and lasts all day! I have tried all of the clinicals and nothing beats this!",4
"I have tried everything, including Under Army, all of the Clinicals and nothing worked. I don't have much of a problem with wetness..it's odor..This product is the very best that I have found..I simply love it. I always feel and smell fresh..",4
"I have tried hundreds of eye creams and this one really works. It is firming, moisturizing, and goes on easily. I have run out at times, and can always notice the difference. It diminishes wrinkles around eye area and seems to brighten them some ",4
"I have tried hundreds of lip balms over the years and I use lip balm all day and night - THERE IS NO BETTER LIP BALM on the market and I am so sad that this has been discontinued! I am really depressed! Please bring this back, Leslie. ",4
"I have tried just about every single mascara on the market. I do not buy cheap, retail brands. I only buy the best names through Sephora. I tried this one based upon the description and it is all true. Since I've reached the over 45 crowd, my eyelashes have thinned out. This mascara makes them look voluptious. It isn't drying, flaky or clumpy. I just love it! ",3
I have tried Korres products in the past and been pleased with them. I love this product. The smell in very light and the scrubbing grains are the perfect texture. My skin feels great after using the Pomegranate Scrub. ,3
"I have tried many brow gels and this is the only one that truly works for me. When I start applying makeup in the morning, there are just a few brow hairs that are going every which way and this puts them in their place all day.",0
"I have tried many brow powders and pencils and have found this as one of the best products out there. Great variety of shades; however, the only thing I wish is that they package it as one shade since I never use the other half.",2
I have tried many brow products and many of them leave my brows flakey or are too dark. This is a great eye gel. It has just enough color to fill in my eyebrows without them looking to dark. My eyebrows look very natural with this gel.,4
"I have tried many ""brow tamers"" but this is the only one that does not cake or peel. No little white flecks at the end of the day with this one! It looks very natural and my brows do not budge all day. ",2
"I have tried many different mascaras and while some give me the volume I long for, they run quickly because my eyes water a lot. This is the only mascara I have tried that is truly smudge-proof and water-resistant. It stays beautiful all day and comes off easily in the shower. I recommend it to all of my friends! ",0
"I have tried many eyebrow pencils and I must say Anastasia's Perfect Brow Pencil in Ultimate Brow is a perfect match to my natural hair color, I just love it! I always make sure I buy at least 2 at a time. I can't be without it.",1
"I have tried many eyeshadow primer without any success. They seem to dry out my eyelids or cake too much and then I look like a dry crumbled mess! This is excellent. Feels smooth going on and really lasts all day without interferring with your eye shadow. I wore it for my wedding day in the summer! Try it, you'll love it. ",2
"I have tried many many eyeliners over the years to find one that doesn't slide off my eyes by mid-afternoon -- pencils, liquid liners, creams, you name it, I tried it. This is one of the first eyeliners I have ever tried that stays where I put it. Added bonus: it comes in tons of great colors!",1
"I have tried many, many under eye creams, but something is always amiss. Finally, a creamy eye treatment that feels good, sinks in and does what it says it will do. I tend to be oily and this cream goes on, sinks in and doesn't affect my makeup application at all. Clarins, in my opinion always delivers an outstanding product. This cream is no different. And the tube lasts a long, long, long time. ",2
I have tried many of the Ojon products and they are all great. I have baby fine color-treated hair and not a lot of it. My biggest fear is paying a lot of money for a product that weighs down my hair. This is NOT one of those products. The best use I have found for this product is spraying on dry hair and blow drying it to freshen my hair if I don't want to wash it. My color looks so refreshed when I'm finished! ,3
"I have tried many ""peel pads"" with some sucess. But...these pads are the ""BEST"". I will look no further..they are just what my 50+ skin needed to refresh...revitalize...renew! Why did I stay away from this line for soooo long?",4
"I have tried many serums and the like, from Cosmedicine, Kinerase, Dr. Brandt, and this one worked for me. Before, my skin looked tired, dull, but the Vinoperfect created a beautiful radiance. When I ran out, I thought ""NOOOOoooooo"", 'till I received my replacement.",2
"I have tried monistat chafing gel as a cheaper substitute, but it really cannot compare with the smoothness that this primer gives. My skin feels like a peach after I use it. If you don't want to fork over so much money, I would recommend getting the smaller sample and seeing if it works for you. :D",1
"I have tried most all foundations. Fabulous. I am 51 with dry skin. Goes on a bit heavy but dries so light and it is a beautiful coverage. I forget the foundation is on. Compliments all the time....my skin glows and that is what women tell me, I have beautiful skin and its the Dior Sculpt. A must try if you are searching for a new foundation. You won't be disappointed and great color selection. I don't use moisturizer before I place this on my face. ",3
I have tried other lip pencils but keep coming back to this one. The medium color works with any lip color you choose to wear. You can also enhance the shape of the lip without it looking fake and clownish. Lasts forever. I do recommend a quality sharpener to use with this pencil. otherwise you can't keep the tip from breaking off. Once I figured that out I see no reason to switch to another brand. ,3
I have tried other products over the years but have always come back to the tried and true Lancome. People guess my age 10 years younger and I attribute it to Lancome. This as well as their other products do the trick! ,3
"I have tried (seriously) almost every mascara on the market, generally a new one every 2 weeks, and this is only second to YSL! I love this mascara, and it makes my lashes look long. Most of the time people think I am wearing fake lashes. Two coats is usually the magic number! ",0
"I have tried several drug store brand minerals because of their built in brushes, and wasn't really happy with the results. This brush does the job, is really soft, and the body raises up over the brush so you can close it without messing up the bristles. Ingenious! ",3
"I have tried several kinds of oil blotting papers and these are the absolute best! I think Shiseido has the edge on these because of the powder coating on the sheets. After a long day at the office, I use these before I go out for the evening and my face looks like I just reapplied my foundation. ",3
I have tried several of your body butter's and they all have great fragrances. There isn't one that I like better than the other. The cream goes on great and lasts all day on your body. It's the best! ,4
"I have tried several primers and always got creases and my shadows faded. This one really works. I was a little skeptical when I first put it on because it is not heavy at all and I thought it was too watery to work, but don't worry it does what it says. Just work it in by patting it in. ",3
"I have tried several primers and this one is definitely the best. I am 55 years old and wear the bronzing primer, where you get just a hint of color--under my foundation. I can't imagine not using this primer. It evens out my skintone and makes my face feel so smooth. It is absolutely wonderful. ",3
"I have tried so many different eye makeup removers and I keep coming back to this because it's simply the best. Removes eye makeup with no scrubbing, no rubbing, no stinging. I have stopped looking. I just won't use anything else. I buy it in bulk.",2
I have tried so many other mascaras but this one is by far the best one. I have the shortest eyelashes and whenever I wear this people always give me compliments about my eye makeup. I definately recommend it. ,1
"i have tried so many products on my hyperpigmented sun-damaged face. i can finally be out in the sun without panicking over the dark shadow above my upper lip that would show up later. this product amazingly starts working overnight and is the only thing that has ever faded the discoloration at all! thank you, murad for rescuing me!!!",1
"I have tried the face finishing moisturizer previously and found it wonderderful for my dry skin and I love the ""rose"" smell. Also, Perricone products in general; you can't go wrong. This is a very good buy for the amount of product you get. I great introduction into the quality of this line. ",4
I have tried the serum and liked it so I bought this kit to give a try to more of the line. IF you do not love a highly scented jasmine perfume skip it. I love the scent so I was a happy camper. My hair is naturally curly with some frizz. The shampoo takes some getting used to. No lather and I felt I had to use a lot of it to get a clean feeling. Same withe conditioner. I used the spray and the serum while my hair was still wet. Then I pulled my hair straight up into a bun and left it till it dried.My hair came out smooth and shiny with just enough curl. Really outstanding results - my hair is thinning and it felt much thicker. The shampoo is quite pricey and I think I will try and see how it works using a different poo - the spray and serum are outstanding. I haven't tried the hair mask yet. Looking forward to it. Great products. ,4
"I have tried this for some time and it is not what I expected and find other products work better for me. However, everyone is different. I think the price is a bit high and have other products that work better for me at more reasonable prices. ",4
"I have tried this only as a sample. It is very soothing and is quite rich, but not heavy. I can see that it would be perfect for someone whose skin might be more dry than mine. For combination skin like mine, this might work well if used only occasionally, but the feel is so addictive that use only occasionally might be hard to do. ",4
"I have tried three colors of this lipstick - Fresh Carnal, Fawn Nestle, and Boccacino - and all three colors are AMAZING! The Fresh Carnal is a beautiful, light pink - great for most skintones. Fawn Nestle is the perfect nude and Boccacino is a beautiful berry stain - perfect for fall. This lipstick is super moisterizing, protects with sunscreen, plus leaves great light color that lasts. Also, for fellow Celiac Diesease sufferers, it is gluten-free according to their customer service depo. (All Vincent Longo lipsticks were, according to them, except the Gel X) ",1
"I have tried tons of mascaras, anywhere between $5-$30, and this one is not even the most expensive (usually is around $22) but is definitely in my top three favorites list. If you put on 2-3 coats, your lashes will look much much fuller than what you started with! My lashes are not very long, so diorshow is definitely my best friend when it comes to make up secrets =) ",0
"I have twin sons who have just turned 18, and are in college. They have begun to care about those zits that emerge just before a big event. They have been using Murad products successfully for a year, and their skin improved- but those occasional zits that had their own zip code occasionally came to call. This not only dries them out, but conceals them-- as close as two he-men will ever get to makeup in this life. My one comment- make more of the medium, because it is always sold out in the Sephora store where I occasionally visit!! ",3
"I have two Matte Pencils: Dragon Girl and Roman Holiday. They are so much fun and such awesome colors that it's hard for me to not apply them all the time. The Roman Holiday is more subtle, but can be built up and I have noticed that with some of the other colors--they're great for all times of day and all types of people.",0
I have used a diamond file for years but this glass file is the best ever. Absolutely no nail damage and shaping is done with minimal effort. My nails are strong and healthy so I can only imagine the results on softer and problem nails; has to be the perfect grooming tool. ,4
"I have used a face wash for acne prone skin for years. Over time, it became to harsh for my skin and searched for a product that would keep my skin clean and CLEAR. I have been using this for 6 months and have never not have severe break out since. The smell is another plus :)",1
"I have used Bare Escentuals for several years; the""best"" for all ages and skin types. some hints 1. Feel free to blend to get the perfect shade for the perfect look -- for foundation, eye colors, overall face colors and blush 2. Practice the blend, tap and buff techniques using a light hand; you will feel like a pro in no time 3. the primer makes a wonderful base; mineral veil is the finishing touch to make you feel like a model 4. consider investing in a few upgrades-- a kabuki brush if you prefer more coverage; bisque if you have imperfections (use with a free hand with the concealer brush), the lip glosses to finish the look off (if you don't want to look made up but want to be astounded at how fabulous you look 5. know you are buying from a company whose staff care about service and you feeling and looking good; I ran into a regional manage on vacation in Chicago and she worked with me asking questions and offering tips without a hard sell ",4
I have used Bare Esscentuals ID mineral make up for years. My biggest complaint is that it is messy and sometimes can go on too heavy. I tried this philosophy product and absoluely love it. You apply it with the sponge applicator (no waste and no mess) and have a great deal of control in the application process - as little or as much as needed. ,3
"I have used Brow Tech for many years. I've tried the soft brown and the brunette. Mixing the two together is actually better for me. It goes on well, stays in place, and gives a really natural look. I love it. ",4
I have used COUNTLESS body lotions/creams and this is by far the best that I've ever used. It actually works! I have the driest body skin in the world and it even works on my skin. No more flaking and peeling for me. Seems to even out my skin tone as well. I am tan and it makes my skin soft and smooth. Even my husband commented on how soft my skin is. Definitely recommend this product. ,3
"I have used different brands of primers and this takes the cake. I use it with different brands of mascara and it goes on very light, not clumpy like some primers. It works really well if you wear contacts too, its not heavy like others. Basically feels like your putting water on your lashes but you can see a great improvement in any mascara you purchase!",0
"I have used drug/grocery store mascara my entire life. This mascara, I found to be creamy, easy to use and nonsmudging. As I have gotten older and my lashes have thinned out, this wonderful product has helped. ",3
"I have used eyeliner pencils and liquid eyeliner that comes out of the tube with a brush, even a pen-type eyeliner, but Smashbox Cream Eye Liner is the first Cream Eyeliner I have ever tried. It works very well as a basic eyeliner, which is what it is designed to do, but I have found that the gorgeous colors can be used as lid color accents too. I have 2 of the multi-shade compacts and highly recommend them as a multii-use product. Did you know that you can use BE's multi-tasking powder, then use one or moreSmashbox beautifully hued cream eyeliner as a shadow too? The light coating of powder sets the cream and keeps in in place very well. It is mostly smudgeproof, although I have better results applying it as a ltraditional liner using a tiny brush made for cream lip liner to apply it rather than the broad brush Smashbox sometimes sells with the compacts. Try one of the compacts with many colors. You will be very surprised at the special effects you can create from the palette. I love it! ",3
"I HAVE USED FRACAS WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS A VERY ELEGANT FRAGRANCE, FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS. I HAVE THE 3.4 OZ BOTTLE AT HOME AND THIS LITTLE ROLL ON IS SO PERFECT FOR CARRYING WITH ME IN MY PURSE FOR REFRESHING LATER IN THE DAY. I WAS VERY SURPRIZED AT JUST HOW MUCH IS IN THE ROLL-ON. GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE LITTLE BLACK & PINK BAG IT COMES IN AS WELL.!! ",3
"I have used Fresh Soy facial cleanser; however, had no particular love for or attachment to this brand/line. I decided to try this product because I've been overdue for a powerful night product at my age: 45. I am 45 years old; however, my skin looks quite good, thanks to my gene pool and my slight addiction to face care products. Still, I've begun to notice ""marionette"" lines, dark circles, and a slight, overall ""bleh/meh"" quality overcoming my face. Additionally, my neck is showing more age, actually doing some horrifying, stretchy things! I've only used this product three nights. Already? I love it! In the morning, my face is BEAUTIFUL, smooth, and soft-looking. My face doesn't appear to be that of a 45 year old awakening; it looks more like a 35 year old in the morning (that's a huge difference; trust me). I'm so in love, I'm back on the website to see what Fresh offers for daytime care for aging skin. ",3
"I have used lipsticks from all the pricey department store companies and I think that BE's lipcolor is one of the absolute best I've ever worn. No lipcolor stays on forever, and that's as it should be. The ingredients in those products that claim to stay on all day tend to make my lips dry and chapped. BE's lipcolor is smooth, soothing, rich and feels like a lip balm. The color selection is outstanding. I'm throwing out all my other lip colors. It's BE only from now on. ",4
I have used Nars powder blush for several years. My daughter gave me The Multiple for my birthday and I love it! Nars is absolutely the best blush EVER! The Multiple doesn't settle into the fine lines and gives me the perfect natural blush and color on my cheeks. ,4
"I have used Orgasm exclusively for over a year because I have not found another product that comes close to it. The peachy pink shade looks natural on my light olive skin. The color has a slight glow. However, it is not sparkly like many other blushes I have used in the past. Instead, it just catches the light to bring out my cheek bones.",1
"I have used orgasm for several years and absolutely love it. My mother ( 60's), sister, and several girlfriends all use it also. The color gives you a beautiful glow but is not to shiny, so every age can wear it and look great. I also can wear every color eye shadow with this blush and it looks great.",2
"I have used other mineral foundations, which were good. But this one is just the best. I love that I only shave off as much as I need to. I love the dewy look it gives my complexion. I am 56 and raised in the '60s when who knew about sun damage to the skin!!! I am so glad I tried this product. Thank you Smashbox and thank you Sephora for offering it.",4
"I have used sunscreens since 1981 after a diagnosis of skin cancer. I have experienced the shines, the tightness and all other unpleasant side effects of sunscreens. THIS ONE HAS NONE OF THEM. It is a pleasure to use and I shall continue to do so. ",4
"I have used the best eyeshadow money can buy, but could never get the look or color RIGHT, Then this magic compact came along and my eyes just pop. I have irrdescent green eyes, sounds nice till you put eyeshadow on...these shades work perfect...I love them. the powder blends smooth, and I love playing with the looks on my top and bottom lashes....goes on easy and stays....very nice.... ",3
I have used the glossing cream for a few years now. It doesn't weigh down my hair and keeps my hair healthly looking and shiny. You apply to wet hair so my hair never feels oily after application. I recommend it. ,2
"I have used the regular Venom in the past and thought this would be great under my lipstick, but unfortunately it barely has any effect and the smell is too strong.It also has no moisturizing benefits as I had hoped! Save your money ladies! ",0
"I have used the toliette in the past, but find the Parfum more aromatic and get asked ""what I'm wearing"" as it is so pleasant and not overwhelming at all. Someone in health care would do well with this product. A straight ""parfum"" is due out shortly and I will probably try that when it is available. ",4
"I have used this for about a year and I think it works nicely. It does go on a bit heavy, but absorbs and my skin just feels so soft and nice. I have sensitive, mature skin and can be prone to monthly breakouts, but this works great for me. ",3
"I have used this for over 3 years and have never wanted to try any other mascara. I'm hooked! It stays on all day and I have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes since I work on a computer all day. I prefer the brown but Sephora only carries black. It takes a bit of soaking and a gentle tug to get it off. Don't be concerned if you see your ""eyelashes"" falling out in the sink at night. It's only the tubes that covers the eyelashes that are being removed, although at first it will make you do a double take.\nBe aware that you really cannot build with coats of mascara with this product. One coat is all you need.",4
"I have used this item in ""Head Shot"". The colors look great on just about anybody, and are very portable. My only objection with the Smashbox cosmetics, is that for such small items, they are very expensive, and do not last a long time. They have good wear on the body, but with such small packaging, you have to repurchase your favorites frequently. ",1
I have used this Lancome eye makeup remover for several years. From time to time I would try something else and end up throwing it away as it did not compare to this one. You don't get the feeling that it's too harsh for the delicate skin around the eye and it removes mascara and shadow very easily and quickly.,4
I have used this mineral makeup for several years and I love it. You don't feel as if you have makeup on and this particular kit is the perfect size to get started with the minerals. I personally like the Kabuki brush for the foundation. I feel it gives more coverage. I have tried new makeups but I always return to Bare Escentuals. ,3
"I have used this product a few times. I like to use it particularly when I am using a curing iron for straightening my hair as I feel it offers a bit more protection. It is easy to use, but I'm still deciding whether it is ""the one"" for my hair type which is fine, naturally curly (but I wear it straight) and colored. I guess I feel fairly neutral about it = unlike some other products I've tried, which I cannot do without. ",4
I have used this product for 3 years. It stays all day long and covers up my imperfections. I reorder this product when 1/4 of bottle is left. Best foundation I have ever had. Great for oily - combo skin. ,2
"I have used this product for about 3 weeks now. I think I have seen some minor improvement in fine lines/firmness/tightening. I definitely would not compare the results to injectable office fillers. I did not return the product,will finish it to give it a chance, but won't order it again - too expensive for the results obtained. ",3
"I have used this product for many years and there are no words to describe how wonderful, not only your skin feels, but how you feel allover inside and out after using this Body Polish. I jsut love it!",2
I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MAYBE FIVE YEARS NOW AND HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED HOW IT MAKES MY HAIR LOOK AND FEEL. I NOW PUT A LITTLE ON BEFORE I BLOWDRY MY HAIR (READ THAT IN A MAGAZINE) AND IT MAKES MY HAIR EVEN SILKIER. I HAVE PLATINUM GREY & BLONDE HAIR WHICH CAN BE DRY AND FLYAWAY...THIS TAMES IT ALL AND MAKES MY HAIR SHINY AND SHOWS THE COLOR WELL. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY AND THIS SMALLL SIZE HOLDS ALOT AND IS PERFECT FOR TRAVELING OR SIMPLY TAKING UP LESS ROOM IN YOUR BATHROOM. ,3
I have used this product for over a year now and wouldn't do without it. A quick spray on wet hair before blow drying and my hair is protected from the heat of the dryer. I have fine hair and ghd keeps it in good condition. ,4
I have used this product for over two years now. This removes my waterproof eye make up with one swipe. Never has it irritated my eyes like other products and doesn't leave behind a greasy mess. Definitely worth the money!,1
I have used this product for several years along with other products in the Philosophy line. It is especially good at disolving and removing makeup yet it is gentle enough to use on the eyes. The smell of the product is unusual- definately not floral- more like natural botanical.,3
"I have used this product for several years and CANNOT be without it...it evens out surfaces so that foundation just glides on. I have dry skin so this really makes application so much easier...I would agree with another reviewer about the packaging, however. I also have to use a Q-tip to get the last of the bottle..perhaps a change to a tube would be a good thing?",4
"I have used this product for several years. It is a terrific exfoliator for change-of-season dry, flaky skin. Follow the directions for time, though, because it will leave your face red and sore if you leave it on too long. ",3
"I have used this product for the last 2 years...It's great in the hot Texas sun...by the pool anywhere...Fl, Va, Tx, NC and NH...I love it at the beach, no stickiness and when you reapply, it feels cool and refreshing and NO sand stuck to your skin... ",4
"i have used this product for three yearts, i have some small red spot on my face. This product covers them completely and they do not show thru later on in the day. One would never think a powder would have such good coverage.",4
"I have used this Shampoo for about 4 years. I will another brand but always go back to this line. I have super fine, blond medium length hair that looks limp and tired. this Shampoo with the conditioner and one styling product does the trick. soft fluffy well groomed hair. Love it Love it Love it. ",3
"I have used tons of creams from expensive to cheap. This is among the best out there for such a reasonable price for a higher end brand. Silky, cooling, not oily or heavy at all, clean refreshing feeling. As gentle as it is I would say it is great for all skin types including sensitive. ",3
I have used Urban Decay before Sephora carried it. It was sold in Hot Topic. Then they stopped carrying it and I was worried on where I could find this. Internet was new at that time. One day I saw it at Sephora and immediately grabbed it. Midnight Cowboy rides again gets me so so so many compliments even from pple who just saw me wearing it in the photos. ,1
"I have used various types of moisturizers with limited success before trying this one. My skin is always parched during the Fall & Winter months. I've searched for a product that will actually work and this one does it for me. It is heavier than most but will absorb quickly. I can wear foundation over it without feeling my face feeling ""cakey"". ",3
"I have various texture issues, some redness, some broken capillaries, etc. I use BE foundation, bisque, and other make-up, but this primer makes it all look fabulous!! Smooths out my skin and gives me that teen-perfect glow. Love it!! ",2
"I have very coarse, thick hair, naturally curly (loose), which is constantly dry so I am always looking for products that will tame frizz and add shine. I would rate this cream at the top of the list. It contains some type of olive oil so it should be used sparingly to avoid weighing your hair down. I add it the ends of my hair and at the crown to reduce frizz and fly-aways. ",1
"I have VERY dark circles, NOT the little shadows that most girls have that can be easily covered by most concealers on the market. I have used just about every concealer brand on the market, including Dermablend, which I have used most often until now. While browsing on Sephora looking for any new concealers on the market, I came across Make Up For Ever and realized I had never tried this brand. It had gotten good reviews, so I figured why not give it a shot. I am so glad I did! This brand works so well at hiding the dark circles! Not only did it blend well, but is covered well, and most important, it actually lasted all day! One of the biggest problems I have with all other concealers is that they do not last. I put it on and 2 hours later it is faded or caked in one area and I have to reapply and rearrange. But with this stuff, I apply it in the morning, use a little mineral powder over it, and it lasts into the evening until I have to touch up again. It is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who really has dark circles to contend with. ",3
"I have very dry and sensitive skin as well as being over 55y/o.Immortelle does not break my skin out and I often go without makeup on most days with full confidence. When I do wear makeup, it only adds to the over all beauty of my skin. I have searched for YEARS for a sunscreen that didn't break my skin out or clog my pores and protected my skin. This is the product for me! Thanks! ",4
"I have very dry, itchy skin, especially on my legs after shaving. This lotion helped my dry skin tremendously. They did not itch when I applied this lotion. The only negative is that the fragrance is not very good, otherwise, great product.",0
"I have very dry skin; so, I bought the body butter in the Vanilla Cupcake~YUMMY! This scent is heavenly and timely! I love body butters and this one is the best! I know I will be ordering more from this collection! ",4
"I have very fair skin and the No Money No Honey is great alone for a day look that wakes up my complexion a bit. Not super glittery, and perfect if you want to do a darker lip. I'm not sure it's possible to go through a whole jar of this, I've been using mine for months and I feel like I've barely made a dent. ",1
"I have very fair skin that burns easily, so I've gone through a LOT of different products trying to find the perfect sunscreen. This stuff is my absolute favorite for everyday body suncare -- it's not sticky or oily like so many other sunblock creams and lotions, the spray makes it quick and convenient to apply and the light, pleasant fragrance is a welcome change from the usual beachy-coconut smells so common in sunblock. The only things I'd change about it if I could would be to make it availabe in higher SPF, for those of us who burn under a strong lightbulb, and maybe an unscented version that won't clash with other fragranced products...other than that, this is the perfect everyday body sunblock I've been searching for all my life. Please don't discontinue this one, guys! ",2
"I have very light eyebrows and this products fills them in VERY naturally. Looks much better than eyebrow pencil. I even bought some for my Mom for Christmas. The only thing I do not like about this product is it usually does not last all day, but I have oily skin which could play a factor. Aside from that, it is great!",1
"I have very oily skin and have tried many, many products over the years. I discovered this about 3 years ago and have found it to be the absolute best for mattifying and oil control. I do need to use it several times a day, but it works well over and under makeup. My favorite Sephora product. ",4
I have very oily skin including my eyelids and this is the best product that I have tried that keeps my eyeshadow creaseless all day. A little dab goes a long way. I get a little dab rub it on the tip of my ringfingers and apply it to the eyelids and then apply any powder eyeshadow. ,4
"I have very sensitive eyes. This mascara has not stung my eyes once, and it is the only mascara I can say that about. Not only that, but my lashes look fantastic. Just long and fat and not spidery clumpy at all. ",1
"I have very sensitive, mostly extremely dry skin that sometimes gets little bumps...This is one of the best cleansers I have found that cleans without drying and does not aggravate my sensitive skin. I highly recommend it, since if it works for my sensitive skin when many other ""sensitive"" products don't, then it should work for just about anyone!",2
"I have very sensitive skin and am prone to really bad ingrown hairs on my bikini line after both shaving and waxing I've tried a number of products and none worked. this stuff is great. No smell and nice gel texture, not greasy or sticky. I will definitely keep using it",1
I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser is a miracle worker! It removes makeup wonderfully and leaves my skin feeling clean and clear with a healthy glow. I am a new user of Philosophy and am very impressed with how this product has made my skin feel in just one week of use. I would highly recommend you give it a try if you are looking for that perfect milky cleanser. LOVE IT! :),1
"I have very sensitive skin and very chapped lips. I believe I've tried basically every single lip treatment Sephora offers, which does not contain octinoxate (which I am allergic to). I wanted so much to love this, but it was a little grainy, not particularly moisturizing, and it gave me little hives around my lips. And I've read the ingredients list 50 times over and can't figure out what I'm allergic to! ",0
"I have very sensitive skin. I can use this nightly with no redness or irritation. After the first four nights, my face felt smoother and it's texture was much better. After a couple of weeks using it about 5 nights out of seven, fine eye wrinkles were smoother and not as noticable. Note: It is not an overnight miracle worker, but I will not be without this product (unless DDF finds a way to make it even better!) ",3
"i have very sensitive skin. i'm very careful with what i put on my face. some products make my skin too dry, others make me break out and i don't like anything with a fragrance. my dad uses the entire anthony line and i tried this product. IT'S PERFECT. it works really well with my sensitive skin. its softer than an exfoliant but still cleanses really well. its leaves my skin moisturized and looking really good. it helped calm my acne and was worth every penny.",0
"I have very sensitive skin that turns red and breaks out so easily! This is the ONLY face wash that cleans my skin, never over dries, calms the redness, and dramatically reduces my breakouts. I have tried sooo many other face washes on the market but to nothing woks like this...I can't say enough about how wonderful this product is.",1
"I HAVE WANTED THIS NAIL POLISH FOR YEARS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO GET IT. I BOUGHT THREE UNTIL MY NEXT ORDER. I TOOK THIS ONE AND GOT MY NAILS DONE AND A LOT OF WOMEN ASKED ME WHAT COLOR IT WAS, WHO MADE IT AND WHERE THEY COULD GET IT ! DEFINITELY A HIT ! COLORS ARE INTENSE NO MATTER COLOR YOU CHOOSE, AND LONG WEARING. ",4
I have wavy coarse hair but this product makes it looks more bouncy and falls in a nice way. I have bought this product several times. Even my friends and strangers stop to say wow your hair looks good today whenever I used it. This doesnt make the hair dry and stiff. I still can run my fingers through my hair or rather my boyfriend can. ,1
"I have weak nails, and I can NEVER get polish to go on and look professional. I tried these on a whim, and I am so excited!! Have only been wearing them for a day so far, but my nails look like they have had a professional manicure - and I lead a VERY 'hands on' life. I am buying MORE, and I want to ask Sephora to make them in a few more colours...maybe a nude shade, or a peach...? ",3
"I have well over 100 lipsticks. Yes. 100. And how many do I wear? Not many. Very few. But I love the Matte Velvet Lip Pencils by Nars. These I wear. And I get compliments. Lots of compliments. They stay on all day, and I eat with them on...a lot. Even after eating, they don't leave me with that weird ""just the outline and nothing inside"" look that we all love, right? So, will I stop buying other lipsticks? Probably not. But will I have to buy replacements for all the Nars lip pencils I've used up? Most defintely!",2
"I have worn Amarige for years. It is the only perfume I wear. Everywhere I go someone always wants to know what I am wearing! Men ask as often as women! If people don't ask, I always hear ""You smell wonderful""! My husband loves it and buys my perfume for me as gifts!",4
I have worn this product for three years now and would not step out of the house w/o it. I have not had a sunburned since using this. My skin tends to be more dry than oily but this has never left a greasy feel on my face. ,2
I heard about Lip Venom years ago and decided to give it a try. It didn't work for me -- no lip plumping action at all and the sides of my mouth turned quite red if I used too much and it ran off my lips. I returned it. ,3
"I heard a lot of great reviews about this and it is a great product. It doesn't go well with any of my Make Up Forever products though. When I put it over my cheek bones, it was kinda cakey. I do love the color though. I would recommend this product",0
I heard so many good things about this and got one for my DH. He used to get those really ugly ingrown hairs and this was the answer to his problem. It cleared up the old ones and now his face looks pretty again. hehe ,1
"I hear gourmand and thought i try it out.... unfortunatlly it is way too light for me ... heavier then the original diamonds but too light for a person who enjoys Angel, No.5, Madmoselle, Fracas....... :( but it is nice for people that enjoy lighter scents ",1
"I hesitated buying yet another ""waterproof"" eyeliner, but I was pleasantly surprised. It really stays on all day!! Just one suggestion....can you make it in gray? I don't really like black eyeliner -- too severe. ",4
"I highly dislike this product. I had high hopes for this foundation so I took a sample home. Once I used it, I noticed my pores looked rather large. My very oily skin became even more oily than it usually is. I was also very disappointed with the color, it looked a bit orange-y on my very light skin. Overall, I would NOT reccomend. ",0
"I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from oily or acne-prone skin. it is gentle but effective at keeping pores clear of debris and oil. it has a light formulation that absorbs and does its job without reddening the skin or causing flaking. it provides light moisturizing, which is good for even acned skin. it also minimizes shine. a great product. ",2
"I highly regret not buying this when I took this home as a sample from Sephora. I asked the lady to give 5 samples of this and couple other ones. But as soon as I got home I spray this on before going out. Everyone wanted to know who i was wearing. That's when I knew, I had to buy it. It smells to incredible. Can't explain it. At least try it, because by the end of the week, you'll end up buying it!!!!! Amazing ",0
"I honestly got this set for myself because I wanted the Snickerdoodle (it's my favorite cookie). I really didn't need anymore sugar cookie or chocolate chip, but I'll give those away to secret santa pals at Christmas. Anyhow, the set as a whole is darling and all the smells are wonderful. I would highly recommend this as a gift for you or for someone else. ",3
"I honestly love this product. I have all my go to shadows in one small cute palette. Yes, the shadows might look small, but the pigment in them is totally awesome. You can create all kinds of looks, from subtle to work to dramatic. ",0
II had recieved this as a sample and loved it. Of course it was the wrong shade but I used bronzer to correct that. I went to my nearest sephora store and they were sold out but at least I found out what color I needed. My order arrived and I was thirill. Eventhough I'm in my fifties I have problem with oily skin and this stays looking fresh all day long and gives me the kind of coverage I had been looking for. My face looks smooth and healthy. ,3
"I initially bought this set because of Beach Bunny, my favorite summer coloers, but the whole set is a fabulous deal. Unfortunately, I keep giving the cute little compacts away to friends and now will have to buy a whole new set! Grab this deal ",3
"I initially purchased the cleanser,moisturizer am & pm at the store and I am very satisfied with these products.I noticed the kit available and tried the 2 new products, the toner and the clear complexion treatment and of the 2 I would purchase the toner again. The treatment did not impress me as much as the other products in the line. I would recommend the cleanser,toner and moisturizers to anyone who has some problem skin...it really works.The kit is good value to try the product ",2
"I just absolutely love the way this smells! It's not as harsh as Angel seems to some (though I personally love that one too). It smells nothing at all like Angel, not even slightly similar. This one is a little sweet and very soft. Just a verrrry pretty scent. The scent just keeps on smelling good long after you put it on too. Love this one!!!",1
"I just adore this perfume because it has everything that I love about a scent. It is fresh, feminine, understated, light and young, but not so young that a mature woman cannot wear it. If you are discreet, feminine, natural, fresh, unfussy but yet stylish and classy then this scent is for you.",2
"I just bought Nars Blush for the first time in the shade Deep Throat. When it came to me it seemed like a pretty bright pink(I usually go with really natural colors), but it goes on sheer and super subtle. It feels natural too, not that caked on feeling.",1
i just bought this 2 days ago and i already see a huge difference! its super easy to use and everyone says it hurts but its like the tiniest pinch. My zits immediately were less red and smaller. i absolutely recommend getting one of these! ,0
"I just bought this after trying a sample. I love this sutff. I can now shave my bikini area a little more frequently then I could before. NO more itching and the red bumps are gone. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the smell, but other than that this stuff delivers exactly what it promises. ",2
"I just bought this, and I love it! It is my favorite moisturizer ever. I have really weird combination skin, and it can be oily and dry at the same time, and this is perfect. It is very soothing and hydrating without being greasy or irritating. It feels great going on and makes my skin really soft. I highly recommend it! ",0
"I just bought this recently and I have to say, its a great blush for anyone. My cousin has much lighter and paler skin than I do and she looked as great as I did when I had it on. It really does give you that soft rosy flush with a bit of glow and that's always a good thing. It's great if you haven't had enough sleep and you just need something to liven up your appearance. Too much might be overpowering, but if you do it right, it's amazing.",0
"I just discovered this pencil, excellent concept pencil and gloss in one. I like products that make me do less work, which means less time putting on makeup. However, I heard they are discontinuing this, does anyone know if this is true? I bought all the colors available. Would love to see more of this. The price is exceptional as I got them on sale. ",3
"I just got this, and really love it.\nIt is very moisturizing. a little sticky at first, but will be absorbed really fast. I'm thinking if for the summer, I don't even need extra lotion any more.\nJust got another bottle when I went to the outlets this black friday...",0
"I just got this as a sample in the Nude and I absolutely love it! I am online now to order the full size. I have been looking for a tinted moisturizer and I finally found it! Thank goodness for those samples. I want to try the illuminating LM but I dont know if it will be enough coverage for me, so I am going to stick with this sure thing and maybe buy the illuminating one for later! I love it!",1
"I just got this delivered on Monday. I have worn this complete set everyday since then. The colors look very good with my skin tone and even though they are plums, they work well with all of my clothes. ",1
I just got this in the peach shimmer and it's really nice... the color is very natural and the shimmer is subtle... I also have it in the peachy pink matte shade which I love as well... it gives a great flush of color and doesn't streak. ,3
"I just got this today, and I am in love! It is an adorable piece. The only downside is the extreme length of the chain, way longer than I would prefer. The quality seems good, from looking at other jewelry on the Juicy website, it looks like their jewelry is gold plated, but nothing on the packaging indicated that about this piece. I am also hoping they will offer refills of the gloss!!! ",1
"I just love the Bare Escentual Liner Shadow. My color is, Bark, and hands down it is the best liner I have ever used, and I have tried them all over the past 30 years. I love the way I can put it on dry, or wet, with the fabulous brush that has a perfectly flat brush that delivers a perfect line every time. You can create a smoky , soft or bold look with it. I will always use this eyeliner, as I see no reason to ever try another one again. As I said, it is my most favorite product to use, with or without having to put on any other makeup, it is that incredible. ",3
"I just love this brow gel because it darkens my blonde brows with a hint of brown without making them look ""painted on"". There is no smudging and the hairs stay in place all day - even through a work out at the gym!",3
"I just love this palette. Usually I end up having lots of colors which I will never use but all the colors are really usable ones in this palette. I use my own brush and the color is just beautiful. You can mix different colors, use it as itself. Gorgeous work, Sephora! (I usually don't use any brush that comes with this kind of palette.) ",2
I just opened a sample size of this product. They recommend using it as a night cream; and likely I will in the future. It's thick but ever so moisturizing! This will be something I cling to in the winter months when my skin dries out even more. ,1
I just realized that I do way too much shopping at Sephora - this is a fantastic product as a pick me up in the late afternoon - light refreshing aroma and feels great - teenage daughter also has one so we know it is good,2
"I just received the colors ""on stage"" and ""caffeine fix"" in the mail, and I could not make up my mind which one to wear first! They are both very cool colors. ""On stage"" is a plumy brownish color and ""caffeine fix"" is a darker purple. I settled with ""on stage"" first and it goes on well, I have no problem with the size of the brush either. I also couldn't believe how fast it dried. I used two coats and didn't use any top or base coat and it still dries to a shiny finish anyway, usually I need a top coat to get a really good shine out of the drug store polishes. I'm now obsessed with getting even more colors in this line! I like that the colors are edge-y and make me feel pretty fashonable and put together, even though I'm a stay at home mom with two toddlers! ",2
I just received this in the natural purple and it is just too light for my dark skin tone (I wear Bare Escentuals warm tan foundation). The description of sheer plum brown is just not accurate... I would call it pale brownish pink. It looks like I have no color on my lips. I will still give it 2 stars because the cherry flavor is just yummy. They just need more colors for deeper skin tones. ,2
"I just recently used nars blush and I really liked it. It gives the right blush, so natural looking. It stays long. After 8 hours of work, I still look fresh.. I work the night shift 11pm-7am. Around 7 am my co-workers thought Im just about to start to work but actually Im about to go.",1
I just started using this cream which came highly recommended. It is pleasant with no fragrance. It absorbs quickly and is lightweight without any stickiness. I haven't seen any changes in lines yet as touted. I almost fee a need to use another moisturizer on top because it is so light. Right now I think it's overpriced. Time will tell. ,4
"I just tried this liner in Bleu Marine and love it. It's easy to work with. The color is blue which whitens the ""whites of the eyes"" but is not an obvious shades. It's easy to build up for a more dramatic look or just for a thin subtle line. The product wears very well. No smudging or smearing. Even after vigorous excerise in hot weather. ",4
I keep it in the fridge....I wake up with puffy eyes from sinus problems....I look foreward to morning when I put this around my eyes...it feels so wonderful. It takes away wrinkles and even can be used on top of makeup without ruining it... ,2
"I keep this in my gym bag (inside its little plastic case) and find it's perfect for touching up with mineral powder makeup. It would also be great for blush, and it's so cute, I smile every time I use it! ",2
"I keep this in my purse all the time, it gives your complexion a soft focus. However, be careful - the powder comes out in a large amount, and if you put too much it makes you look fake. It's meant to be used lightly. ",0
"I know everyone's eyelashes are different and what we want is different. For me, I like lengthing, some thickening , total separation without clumpyness! This is what you get with Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes. The only downside I have encountered is sometimes the tube is a little dried out. Sephora will accept exchanges no questions asked so this isn't too big of issue. I also can use this without a lash builder or booster underneath.",3
I know it's pricey but the stuff you get from the beauty supply store just won't due anymore. This is so gentle your hair feels better immediately. It doesn't strip color and doesn't burn your scalp. It leaves body but makes your hair easier to manage. I can't use anything else; I've tried and it sucked. ,1
"I know that everyone thinks all nail removers are alike, but this nail remover is miles beyond the others. It just works better and quicker and takes off the polish in the corners that lingers and you try getting out. If you don't believe me, you have to try it ! You'll be surprised. ",3
I know that this is the number one favorite mascara and I just don't get it. It gives me volume but does not give me super length. I really like the length more personally. I felt like it is clumpy too. I use definicils A LOT and tend to like that. I am a mascara junky and have tried too many to count. This is not even in my top 10. ,2
"i know this ceramic skin smoother is not listed as a primer but that is how i use it. it is the best primer i have ever tried. better than all of the ""best"" primers out there. i love it because your makeup goes on so smooth and lasts. it locks in your treatments and your moisturizers. after applying this ceramic skin smoother, apply your foundation about 30 seconds later. don't wait a long time. if you use it just like this you will love it. it makes your pores look smaller and the top notch ingredients are great for your skin. once you try perricone's line , you won't be without his products. ",2
"I know this looks like many other curlers on the market, many of which are lower priced. However, this one is is superior. I have several of the look-alikes and I wish I could tell you why this on works and the others don't I have long straight lashes and this baby works ! ",4
"I know this product is recommended for brown skin but I am a white female with an olive skin tone and it works great on my skin. I have used it for about 3 weeks now and notice a huge improvement in the overall color of my face. My sun/age spots are much lighter and my entire face has a noticeable glow. When first applied, the product seems a little grainy but it absorbs very quickly and leaves a nice texture for your next step. You only need a very small amount. ",3
"I know you're thinking, ""black lip gloss?"" But it is sooo sexy and fun if you're in a flirtatious mood. You can control the ""darkness"" and depending on your natural lip color (mine is a reddish brown) you will end up anywhere in the purple spectrum. I enjoy this gloss, but it doesn't work with every outfit. Play with it though. If nothing else, its a great conversation starter! I hope YSL makes it part of their regular inventory. ",2
"I left off a star because the scent is a bit too herbal for my taste, which is silly, as this is an herbal product; but that's just me. and the extracts it contains- angelica for soothing and mending irritated skin and willow bark to prevent and heal blemishes- are awesome for the skin. I do find that this spray leaves a bit of detectible residue on the face; this again is probably the product's intention, as it is treatment in a spray form. if I could be organized enough to remember to carry this product with me, I would use it throughout the day, as regardless of the so-called residue it does control oil and freshen the skin. it would be good to carry for travel to combat dry air on a plane and air-conditioned or heated rooms. all in all, a very nice product. ",2
"I like a lipstick I can wear everyday to work, that stays on and pleasantly complements my skin tone. So I was really glad to discover this line. When I want a more natural neutral look, I wear Gingersnap, Parfait, Rose Crepe, or Truffle. Plum Brulee has been my go-to color for fall. It is a lovely rich berry color with very tiny flecks of gold that looks gorgeous on. I also wear the Red Delicious. It is a neutral red---- not a blue or an orangey undertone---the color looks very much like the apple. I can wear during the day without it looking overpowering, and it's great. The lipsticks have a semi-matte feel to them, but not dry. It's texture is creamy that goes on smooth, without a heavy feeling on the lips.I would highly recommend this product. ",2
I like all 3 products in this gift set! The lip gloss is not like your normal goopy sticky stuff it melts into your lips as it says it does! The marshmallow creme lotion smells divine and melts into your skin nicely! The body wash is good enough to eat of course lol I don't cause its not edible! I like the recipe's on the bottles of philosophy's bodywash containers on any that are edible of course so neat! ,2
I like a matt lipstick sometimes and this fits the bill. The color is a little darker than I thought it would be but it's noticable. It lasts longer than some other lipsticks I've tried but not long enough. ,3
I liked the set okay. I really liked the brushes. I use them with other shadows. They make it easier to blend the colors. I did use the darkest color for eyeshadow bur it didn't seem to stay on very long. The colors were not real easy to apply even with the god brushes. They didn't semm to want to blend very well. I think this set is overpriced. ,4
"I liked the smell of this product. I didn't find it bad and other reviewers did. I have found the more oil in my hair when I use it, the less it lathers up. If it is used every day there is plenty of lather to wash your hair. If I don't wash for 2 days then it takes two shampoos. ",3
"I liked this gok, got it in the blue and it shows up in a really prety shade of blue/violet. The only thing I didn't like this is how it's not very good at making fine lines and how it's not waterproof although it DOES stay on all day. Another little thing about it is that sometimes, at least for me anyway, when I put it on, it feels like burning until it dries. ",0
"I liked this kit a lot. The only thing that held me back from giving it a full five stars was that I found the eye shadow powder too shimmery, but others may like that. The tiny sizes deliver a huge amount of color, and they're great to keep on hand for mid-day touch-ups. ",3
"I liked this mascara alot when I first started using it. It didn't clump and had great colour, but I found the container to be too big. It went bad (dried up and smelled funny) before I was half way through it. Maybe the smaller version is worth it?",0
"I liked this product..you just need a little and it gives you a nice sheen. I added just a drop to my foundation. I bought the Diffuse color, but with my skintone might try the Glow or Prism next time. ",3
"I liked this wash at first, however I think it was b/c my face was so dry. The set ended up being too gentle on my breakout prone face. It didn't feel like I even washed my face. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone who has a problem with acne. ",1
"I like everything about this mascara. I ordered it in hot chocolate for something different. It looks like my natural lashes only fuller, longer, the way you see pretty lashes on little girls. I use this on days when I want my eyelashes to look completely, naturally beautiful, but not when I'm looking for something dramatic. ",4
I like how easy this makeup is to use. The delivery system is nice and I like the smooth matte finish I get. The only thing that bothers me a little is that it has a mildly strange scent. Overall it's good and I would recommend it. ,2
"I like how this feels on the neck even after the end of the day...soft, not greasy, the product doesn't gather in any lines, no shine. It gives my neck a much smoother look. I am trying to justify the cost to the amount in the jar right now. If I had to decide to reorder today, I most likely would to give it a fair shake. ",3
"I like it, but I'm one of those freaks who needs to feel the burn to believe it's working (but not in exercise! only in lip gloss!). I agree with some other reviewers that it worked better (and hurt more) at first, and then your lips develop a little immunity to it. I don't know if that's all in my head or not, but there it is. If this one is too painful for you, I'd suggest the chapstick version of Lip Venom; it seems milder to me. ",0
"I like mascaras that are more volumizing, but I can't deny that this is a good mascara. If you like long, curled, defined lashes, this is perfect for you. It actually does one of the best jobs of these that I've ever seen. ",0
"I like Philosophy products, and wanted to clear my complexion of sun spots, etc. I have been using the product for 2 weeks now, and do see some improvement. I will continue using it, partly because it contains spf18, and I don't have to use so much plain sun screen with this product. ",4
"I like so many of Laura's products, but this one just doesn't do much for me. It does provide a small amount of subtle shimmer, but not quite worth the purchase. Have tried other products since and they provide more noticeable highlighting. Also wish you could tell how much is in the container...agree with other reviewers...packaging is a bit of a problem. Maybe I need to apply more of a heavy hand with it...but don't want to over do...especially with a highlighting product. ",3
"I, like so many others, were skeptical about purhasing this product due to price and the fact that I have very sensitive skin. I did read reviews on this website and another website and most women raved about this product. So, I had to purchase it. I was diagnosed with rosacea 7 years ago and do get a rosacea related breakout from time to time. I was afraid to start using it worried that my skin would break out or would get very red and irritated. I did get one breakout after starting to use it, but I'm not sure if it was from the Clarisonic or some other skincare product that I started using at the same time. I stopped using it while I had the breakout, but when it was gone, started using it again and I am VERY HAPPY. I am 60 and will never have 30 or 40 year old skin again, although I do have good skin for 60 (very few wrinkles. I did, however, have bumpy skin with dry patches and my makeup just wouldn't go on that nice. I am a skincare and makeup junkie and just didn't enjoy putting on my makeup because I didn't like the way it looked. Since using the Clarisonic faithfully, the dry patches are gone, my skin is much softer and the bumpy skin (which I'm sure is from the rosacea) is much less noticeable. I use the gentle brush, which is the gentlest, and my husband uses the sensitive brush. I haven't used the cleanser that came with it, because I'm afraid it won't agree with me. I use my own cleansers. My makeup goes on much better and looks much nicer. So, if anyone out there is on the fence about buying the Clarisonic, it is worth the investment. ",4
"I like that the lipstick colors are unique and intense... they go on very smooth and give a polished look... I only wish they were a bit more moisturizing, but I usually just add some lip gloss on top... the gold case is simple and classic. ",3
"I like the color and the staying power. I have this in black. It is a bit dry and stiff compared to my other gel and cream liners, but it does last for hours. Would I buy again?... not sure... because of it being a bit dry and stiff. I love the other NP eye products. ",2
I like the color and the taste sensation. However the color does not stay on very long. Just talking seems to slide it off the lips. It doesn't run or creep which is good. but It isn't as great as I had hoped. ,4
"I like the color of this tinted moisturizer but my skin feels very oily after wearing it. I have normal skin that is seldom oily, and I did not like the feel of this at all. I would only recommend it to someone with very dry skin. ",0
I like the concept of having several shades compacted in a blush like this baked formula. I have both the Sunswept and the Roseberry and use them both. They feel creamy when applying and gives your cheeks a glowy natural look. ,2
"I like the coverage and the color, as well as the ease of application, but by the end of the day it feels a bit oily and heavy. I have used many Yves Saint Laurent products and tend to be very pleased with them. ",4
"i like the dior mascara but it did smudge a little on the bottom lashes. THIS STUFF IS THE BEST THERE IS. it doesn't move and although it doesn't volumize, it certainly lengthens and enhances my eyes. i bought it in the purple, black and green. all were great, but i think i prefer the black ....and sometimes the purple. buy it....you will luv it. ",4
"I like the ergonomic set of brushes better. These brushes shed a little. The large powder/blush brush was impossible to release from the plastic protective wrap and it is still jutting out of the brush after tugging, pulling and cutting. The cylinder is not as convenient to use as pictured. ",4
"I like the fact that this is talc-free, so not to settle in fine lines. I apply it on with a brush for an even finish. Doesn't change color in my foundation at the end of the day. Doesn't feel like my skin is suffocating, like other pressed powders I've used. Very good product!! ",2
"I like the liner, but not the brush. It doesnt quite give you a sharp enough line, like the old version does. Please bring back the old, more streamlined container. This container is cute, but not practical. ",3
"I like the lipstick alot, especially on top ot another lip color. The powder is ok. I haven't seen any amazing works of this powder, but I do really like the lipstickand the gold makeup pouch is really cute. ",3
"I like the mascara... although I wish it came in brown. It covers bottom lashes beautifully... they remain wispy. It also lengthens... or, better, it sticks to the ends of your lashes making them look longer. Let it dry and apply again and it works better.... As for the vibration... the button is too close to the end and sometimes difficult to push and have control of the wand. Odd placement. I don't see any benefit with the vibrating wand.",4
"I like the name ""Spackle"" and wanted to love the product. It is an adequate primer, leaves a smooth finish for applying foundation but I didn't not find anything special about it. I've used other primers that I like much better... Laura Mercier, Smashbox. ",4
I like the scent of both the lotion and body wash although it doesn't last to long. the parfum is a little strong and doesn't smell like the body lotion but its okay. I like the way it goes on and just soaks into my skin. ,4
"I like the small case and mini lip pencil... the lipsticks have a nice smooth texture, but I cannot wear 2 of the colors... Eden is a bit light for me, and Aura is very intense/bright... the 2 other color are very nice though. ",3
I like the staying power of this liner; it truly acts as an anchor for color. The only thing I didn't like was that the color didn't come out as I expected. The color was a bit more milky than the nude described on the outer packaging. ,1
I like the traditional shea hand cream better. The scent can be a little bit much for me and the consistency is a bit too thin. I have actually been using it on my feet and lower legs each night and surprisingly I wake up with wonderfully soft soles in the morning. ,1
"I like the way it feels on my lips and it last a long time. I've received compliments on the way the product looks. However, it leaves whatever you touch with your lips sticky. I was hoping the product would smell just like the Cinnamon Buns 3 in 1 shower gel, shampoo, bubble bath but it doesn't. Although I didn't like the smell at all in the tube, it didn't bother me once I applied it to my lips. ",1
I like this acne treatment. The blemish night powder is great. I wear it during the day also. The face cleaners is harsh but does work. It is very drying and does pull pimples to the surface so you will break out after use. The day time blemish lotion is okay...I prefer an oil free primer. The spot treatment is good. I would recommend this for very oily skin with breakouts. ,3
"I like this Buxom Lips product. I'm blonde & light skinned & like pink lips, can't do reds. I wear Trixie & sometimes dip Trixie in my Giddy Pink Bare Escentuals blush for a deeper, longer lasting pink shade. I do think it's too expensive though...",4
I like this concealer (I have #2). The color is perfect for my skin. But what I love is the little rollerball. It does such a better job distributing the product than my finger. It also works well at depuffing the undereye area (like a lymphatic massage). Very good product. ,4
"I like this conditioner, but it's just not strong enough for my hair. I'd always have to use a lot to get my hair to the consistency I like it. If you don't have hair that needs a boost of moisture this is fantastic. ",0
"I like this cream, I use it on my naturally curly hair. It does a good job of giving my curls definition. Also has very little smell which was a plus for me because I don't like strong smelling hair products. ",2
"I like this duo a lot. They suggest you use the brush so that one half always has the pink and one half always has the bronzer to help sculpt cheekbones...it works but can look a little fake. I perfer to use a separate brush and swirl the two together...I think it looks much better, more natural than a heavy bronzer. ",0
"I like this eye makeup remover because it works well but it does sting slightly if I get a lot of it in my eye. There is, however, no residual redness. That's the only reason for the down rating. It does work very well to remove all the eye makeup I can slather on but there are others out there that work just as well and don't make my eyes sting. I will probably keep using this because the price is much lower than that other brand and I use a ton of it. ",4
"I like this eye makeup remover. If you leave it on your eyes for about a minutes and swipe it off gently, all of your eye makeup comes off effortlessly. I have the problem very often that oily eye makeup removers break me out. I do not have this issue with this nice, creamy remover. ",1
"I like this formula the best of all the Clinique lipsticks... it's very creamy, moisturizing and gives good color... plus it's not nearly as expensive as some other brands... I have Blushing Nude and Berry Freeze, and these colors stay on really well... the lighter colors like Posh and Bamboo wear off faster on me... but overall I like this lipstick alot and they feel great on. ",3
"I like this foundation because it goes on nice and even and it lasts pretty much all day. I ordered mine online, but had to go to the store to exchange it for a better color, which was no problem at all. ",2
"I like this gloss because so much can be done with it. I like to ""play"" with color, so I use it as a base sometimes, other times I use it over another color and sometimes when I feel really bold, I use it alone. I think this will be a staple for me. ",3
"I like this gloss, I bought Rocker, but agree with the other reviewers, it does not have much color at all. It does smell good, great color in bottle. I had planned on getting another color but will pass, for the money expected a little more. ",2
I like this light version of the Photo Finish Primer since I have really oily skin and this primer works better in absorbing oil than the regular version of the Photo Finish Primer. One thing I want to mention is that it works even better if I skip moisturizer and just apply this primer right after washing the face. Foundation does last a few hours longer than if I used this primer after moisturzier.,1
"I like this lip gloss, even though it only has a few shades for me. It goes on as a bright pink (which I love) and can get a little darker depending on body heat but I haven't seen alot of variation. I like the color it is and goes on smoothly leaving my lips mositurized and gives them a nice glossy shine. It's a fun product to try. ",0
"I like this lipstick best from Dior. There's a nice variety of shades and it doesn't feel bad on the lips. However,it isn't the best lipstick I've ever used and don't really care for any of the shades. ",0
I like this little brush -- it's great for getting small amounts and fitting into your travel size containers. It does seem to lose bristles more readily than the other brushes and I don't know why? But I was prepared for that with other reviews. That fact and the price is why I gave only 3 stars. -- but I do use it alot! ,4
"I like this moisturizer. I have been using it for a few years now and even when I try other products, I come back to this one. It is not heavy or oily on the skin even though it's a cream. Feels great. I recommend it. ",2
"I like this, nice tint, light smell not very noticeable to me. love the spf but wish it was a little more moisterizing. not sure I like using my finger dipping in the pot to use it. I will prob try a lip brush. ",3
"i like this palette! it's very flexible...you can tone down the colors for a day look or smoke 'em out for a more dramatic nite time look. i love the base color, it's got a subtle sparkle to it, and the deep brown is perfect for lining the lid and blending. you can even use the shadows dry or wet. i also like the cheek color, althought it looks bad on my lips. i have never used cream blush before and i like the soft effect it gives. ",2
"I like this perfume a lot, it's your basic warm, vanilla-scent. I tend to prefer foodsy scents over flowery or powdery ones, so this is right up my alley. It's a young girl's scent too, and staying power is very decent.",0
I LIKE THIS PLUMPING LIP GLOSS OVER MANY OTHERS. THE COLOR IS SOMEWHAT SHEER AND HAS GREAT TEXTURE. IT IS NOT TOO STICKY BUT NOT TOO MUCH LIKE LIPSTICK EITHER. IT HAS A GREAT SCENT AND GIVES THOSE LIPS A LITTLE TINGLE.,1
"I like this primer, and it will be my go to primer for summer/warmer months and maybe when I move. For now though, it can't hold up to the harsh cold winters up here and my dry skin. Even with a moisturizing foundation/powder it still flakes and dries my skin. aside from that this is wonderful. If you don't have dry skin or live in a super dry environment, this is a wonderful primer! ",0
"I like this product a lot - I lean more towards mattifying bronzers, but this one has a very slight sheen that really benefits your skin, and it's not at all orange. I bought it in Laguna and I sweep it all over my face.",0
"I like this product and think it does a pretty good job renewing my skin surface; however, it really leaves a red tinge to my skin for a couple of hours afterwards. It would be a good idea to plan for that redness and not be going out in public immediately afterwards. It eventually fades and leaves skin looking great, but the redness is something else while it lasts. ",3
I like this product and will likely buy it again when I finish my first bottle. It smoothes out my skin tone and helps makeup stay in place longer. I would recommend it to you as long as your skin is not too oily.,1
"I like this product and would order it again, however, I can't really say I like the brush. It's a little too stiff - I'd like to see a little more flexibility. It's not very forgiving if you ""color outside of the lines""! ",3
"I like this product because I can use it without worrying about whether i've protected my lips with spf. (I ALWAYS use spf on lips, face, eyelids and skin.) There's a wide variety of great colors which is very important to me. It doesn't last as long as they claim, but I just carry it with me and touch up now and then. A primer would help with that as well as maybe a gloss if you want. It is hydrating, smooth and comfortable to wear. ",3
"I like this product because it is light and doesn't give you an ""over done"" look. I don't use a lot of it, because I think it gets too shimmery if you use too much, but a little goes a long way with this product. You don't need a ton of it to get the benefits. ",2
"I like this product for my fine, curly hair: I use four spritzes in the palm of my hand, work it through, then wrap a towel around my hair for a few minutes before applying Ojon's Anime Styling Cream. ",2
"I like this product, it is small and very convenient to carry around with you. The only complaint I would have is that I would have liked the magnification on it to be a little more magnified. But overall it's a great product to have with you. ",0
"I like this product; it's easy to use, provides the minimum coverge I like, and is a moisturizer and sunscreen in one. The description reads medium coverage, but I find that it is more of a light coverage -- but I have rosacea, so not much really covers that well. This product does what it is supposed to, and feels good on my skin. ",3
"I like this product, its light , but gives me overall coverage. I use 200 which is very light. I usually use this after the summer when I nolonger have any color. It goes on easily, but cover your hair when spraying.",4
"I like this product - read about it initially in LUCKY magazine and decided to try it. I use 2 other mascaras over it, but like the base it gives. Because of my skin tone, I would not use it alone, but like the mix ",4
"I like this set because it is a great way to try the product without a big investment. Also, the size is ideal for travel and will last quite awhile. As primers go this is a pretty good one, but I have not tried so many that I can compare. ",4
I like this stuff. It definitely lasts a good eight hours. It's not too drying. I just don't let it sit too long before I put the gloss on. The gloss definitely feels less sticky and more moisturizing than cheaper brands. I usually use the lip Frixtion stuff underneath the lipstick just to make sure my lips are smooth. ,1
"I like tihs cleanser alot, I had run out and I decided to try boscia and it did not worked for me so I reorder philosophy. I do recommed it, just that it doesn't remove all the eye make up it leaves a litte you'll have to remove it with a small cotton ball.",0
"I like to mix this when applying eye primer potion, this is light enough in color for my skin, most ""light"" concealer's aren't....it blends beautifully with the primer to really set up a super canvas on which to apply eye makeup and is great for mid day under eye touch up's Knocked off a star because it doesn't last all day and the bottles are sooo cute but product builds up on the wand and get's a little messy-I definaltly suggest giving it a try! ",2
"I like to try new products as soon as they are introduced at Sephora and I had read about this in a magazine and was eager to try it. While it does seems to grab all the little lashes and lengthen lashes, it doesn't thicken my lashes unless I put many coats on. I was a little disappointed in that aspect. ",3
"I like to use natural products. I just started using the Korres system for adult acne and I love it. I bought this as a backup for their acne set. I just use a ""nickel's size"" on my hands and that is enough to cleanse my face. It cleanses my skin without leaving it taut and uncomfortable. I plan to use this cleanser for an indefinite period of time; I will re-order it. It is a simple cleanser and it does what it is meant to do: clean my facial skin. ",4
I like what the mascara does overall for my lashes but you have to have a steady hand when applying. It's difficult to remove if you smudge it - which makes no sense since it didn't stay on my lower lashes when I went swimming. It's ok as an everyday mascara but don't count on it lasting longer than that. ,1
I litterally have people walk into the operating room and say that they love coming to my room because I smell so good. Some think it smells like fresh baked cookies and others agree it is like fresh cotton candy. Don't tell others the name as it should be a secret...,1
"I live by this bronzer/blush duo. I wear Nars bronzer every day, no matter what. It is a part of my small list of essential make-up that I have to have on at all times. It makes you look naturally tan, and doesn't have any organge tint, so it always looks natural. The blush is a great compliment to it as well.",0
I live in a dry climate and I need the moisturizer plus I don't need the heavy coverage THIS IS THAT PRODUCT I put on. Your skin will thank you. The lighter tint my favorite for my light skin. The darker tint for that lightly sun drenched look. ,3
I live in Alaska and it is very dry up here. I have always used a moisturizer on my face. I have a friend that works for a plastic surgeon and she recommends this highly. When you put it on you can feel it just being soaked up in your skin. Never greasy or heavy feeling.,3
"I live in Houston and it's really hard to find a mascara that doesn't melt all over your face but his one is great. I put it on in the morning and it still looks great when I take it off at night. The only con is that it is hard to remove and takes a few extra minutes but for me, it's well worth it. ",2
"I live in LA and was in Las Vegas on business when I stopped in on the Sephora store there. You had just gotten this product and the salesclerk was demonstrating it to a woman with a fair complexion like me. I was asking her why was she demonstrating it to a fair skin person when it says ""for brown skin"". She explained that it is for any type. She put some on my hand and it was very very smooth--that was 1 year ago! I fell in love with the product and the moisturizer. I think it should be renamed to include all skin types as the name seems to be misleading. I LOVE IT! Recently, I went into our local Sephora to maybe try something new along this line. I couldn't find anything that worked this well. Again, the salesclerk said if you like something you better stick with it! Again your people are excellent at what they do. I love this product and your store! ",3
I live in sunny L.A. so I like a tinted moisturizer with a high SPF. This is a little heavy but it works as a sunscreen and light foundation. I makes my skin look nice and dewy. I use either this or the sheer every single day to protect my skin. ,2
I'll admit I use this more on my lips and the color bodes well for my rosacea prone coloring. In a pinch of used it as a blusher and the effect was more of a healthy glow than actually coloring of my cheeks. I keep it in my bag and will purchase another for my vanity and desk drawer. ,3
I'll admit people thought me crazy and even I thought i had lost it...20.00 on tweezers?!?!? But they are amazing. it doesn't matter how tiny a hair is if it has broken through the skin I can grab it with these. I don't even go to get waxed anymore. I can keep up with the shape perfectly and quickly with these. ,1
"i llllllllove this blush, in org*sm. sadly, i misplaced it recently and have been super sad without this glow. in this shade, it's delightfully peachy with some miracle glowy overtone. i adore it. careful, though: with a name like ORG*SM, people may stare (i save it for nighttime use :).",1
I llove this product. I have very curly hair that tends to get frizzy sometimes. I have tried at least twenty different anti-frizz products and NONE has been as effective as Jonathan. It defined my curls in a very natural way -- you can't even tell I have product in my hair. I've introduced it to all of my friends with curly hair and they love it too. ,2
"I LOE these sets by Philosophy! Gives a person a chance to really try the product, but not have so much that if the don't like it, they're STUCK! This Inner Grace set is fantastic! Love it ~ clean, fresh, and great products to try together. THANK YOU, Philosophy!:) ",4
"I looked at a lot of eye treatments before I found what I wanted here. I've had dark circles since I was a teen and I just put up with it and did my best with concealers. Now I've got the fine lines and wrinkles and puffiness and decided to do something about it. I learned that vitamin K is excellent for helping with dark circles. The other ingredients in this product help with the other problems, so I decided to try it out. (I love Sephora. You can take it back if it doesn't work. Also it was a Sephora associate that introduced my to Juice Beauty) After using this nightly for several months I've definitly noticed an improvement in all my areas of concern. My eyes look much better and I'm actually proud of how my eyes look after I've used my eye makeup. I can be creative now. Because of my age, I had to be patient to see results, and it paid off. I like trying new products, but I will always be using this for my eyes. ",3
"I loooooove this lip gloss! It's very plumping, but just enough to make your lips look naturally full. Very moisturizing, great colors! I have actually gone through 4 tubes of this stuff in at least a year. I own 11 different colors. Highly recommended for anyone who is afraid of Lipstick, or anyone who just loves a quality gloss.",1
"I looooove UD eyeshadow. I have 4 individual shades and 2 shadow boxes. I always get compliments on Mildew - it's my favorite too - my skintone & hair color look best w/ greens. But I love Asphyxia too, the color on it is amazing, any picture will not do it justice, you have to see it in person. The color shift from purple to blue is crazy! I don't know how they do it! UD is my FAVORITE cosmetic co. and will continue to be so. ",1
"I loooove this scrub. The problem is it's hard for me to spend 65 dollars on a scrub :/ It works very well, smells delightful and makes you feel like you just got back from the spa. I suppose spending 65 dollars for the 15 or so the spa-like treatments it would give is worth it.",0
I LOOOVE the smell of Alien! I've never owned any perfume like it. I also love that they sell a refill bottle! Which makes buying this unique yummy smelling perfume less expensive. The refill bottle even came with a cute little funnel for making transfering the perfume easier without wasting a single drop;o),2
"I lost all my brows to an accident some 40 yrs ago,so I do need a good pencil to stroke in the brows that I do not have. This pencil is easy to handle,and sharpen. The only down side one has to be careful NOT to be heavy handed or one will have a grease brow. ",4
"I love all BE colors. This liner shadow is a very rich, dark hue with bronze undertones. A little goes a long way with this one. I haven't tried it wet but I use the precision shadow brush (the flat one) and push the color into the base of my lashes. BEAUTIFUL! ",4
"I love ALL of Philosophy's bath products, but the scent of ""Surfer Girl"" is so fantistic, I bought 4 sets, and one to give to my best friend. The shower gel has ""polishing beads"" which are perfect to use before applying self tanner. The body lotion leaves a beautiful, pearly sheen on your skin, and the lip gloss is a perfect, non-greasy blend. Great fragrance! ",4
"I love all of the Bare Escentuals products, but the eyeshadow glimmers are by far the best ever! The Queen Tiffany color is the best shimmer brown i own (and ive tried many other make up lines) Not too dark and not too light either. Goes best with the eyeshadow primer! ",0
"I love all of these. Nars makes the best reds and pinks. The texture of this pencil velvety smooth, soft, long lasting, and non drying. It's really good for getting intense color or uniform color without dealing with buildup or blending or matching a lip pencil. Usually with red lipstick the pigment can gravitate to the creases of the lips, but these give you a uniform, intense and superthin layer that will stay put. The S. Machine color looks very sexy and Dolce Vita is like the perfect nude pink for every day or dressing up.",1
"I love all philosopphy products but this one is a top 5 favorite. It's very clean smelling, has a great lather to it, everyone i know loves the smell, and it really is a great 3-in-1! i love to use it every other day on my hair.",0
"I love all the Bare Escentuals products and never had tried the blush until I was told by a group of seniors that I looked pale and needed some color. I tried the blush and now I feel better about my face. I am able to wear blush, apply mineral veil and look great. I have also added the Bare Escentual lip color and my face in on. Thank you Sephora.....!",4
I love all the Bare Escentuals products. But they are hard to travel with. this powder+brush is a good answer. I just keep it in my purse for a touch-up anytime and it has the same coverage as my home kit.. ,3
"I love all the Grace fragrances, and where different ones for different moods. I find Baby Grace to be perfect when I am feeling overwhelmed and need something calming and soothing to de-stress my day, I often spray it on my pillowcases at night for a restful sleep! ",3
"I love all these products! I've used other Philosophy masks in the past, but the one in this set is the best!! Purity Made SImple will forever be my favorite face wash, and Hope in a Jar is lovely-- just takes some time to get used to the scent. ",1
"I love all the Tarte cheek stains. This collection is a little bit creamier in consistency, but still does the trick; beautiful colors that awake your face! Even though the sizing is small, the sticks last a LONG time. I would recommend this for sure! ",3
"I love all things philosophy. I especially love Amazing Grace. I love the words on the bottle, I love the color of the product, and I love the way my skin feels after I wash with it. I also love the smell, and I layer other smells on top of it without discord. Every time I'm close to someone(we have Monday Hug Day at my office) I get told how good I smell. I gave Amazing Grace to my sister to use in her bath and my big, manly brother in law fell in love with it. It's now my default gift when I want to give him something special. It's a wonderful product!",3
"I love Amazing Grace, and I use this shower gel every day. I smell so good when I get out of the shower. The Amazing Grace emulsion is the perfect compliment to it. It is light, foamy, and makes me feel great.",4
"I love Amazing Grace! I had only used the shampoo/shower gel as a shower gel, but I tried using it as a shampoo and I really love it! It smells wonderful and makes my hair feel soft and look shiny. Definitely recommend this product for people with normal hair.",1
"I love (and own) almost every Too Faced Quickie Chronicle ever sold! These make up books are perfect for carrying in your purse or backpack! I always have one in my bag =) The bronzers and cheek colors are great ! The eyeshadows go on really well, I use brushes for sheer color and applicators for more intense color, they blend easily and are very easy to work with. Too Faced Lipgloss is one of my favorite products. I use over lipstick to create the perfect pout, I love them! I've purchased Quickie Chronicles for Birthday, Mother's Day, and Christmas gifts. They're always a HUGE hit ! ",2
"I love anything by Tom Ford. This one did not disappoint. At first, I did not like it. I smelled mediciney. Oh, but the drydown! I LOVED it. And I am NOT a patchouli fan. Another hit by Tom Ford. For the self-assured woman who stands out and does not want to smell like everybody else.",4
"I love Aquolina's Pink Sugar perfume, but Chocolovers takes the cake! I love smelling sweet and yummy and this... well this is a dream come true! The only problem I have is that I can't stop smelling myself because I smell so darn yummy! ",1
I Love Baby Grace and Pure Grace. Pure Grace smells Fresh and Clean like you just got out of the shower. It is non-offensive. I am very sensitive to fragarance yet I can wear all of the Philisophy fragrances.,3
"I LOVE BADgal Lash Mascara! It does tend to run, so I put it on my top lashes only & put a 2nd coat of a good waterproof mascara. I love the big fat brush, & I have had no problems with it drying out--in fact, the 1st tube I bought lasted at least 2 yrs (bad, I know)! That's why the smaller tube is great.",1
"I love Bare Escential products and the color of this Brow Color is very good for light blondes. However, I have very few brow hairs and, therefore, really need a pencil to fill in where there are no hairs. This brow powder does have staying power and is of very good quality. But I still have to use a pencil to fill in. ",4
"I love Bare Escentials and have been using the make-up for 4 years now but this traveling mineral veil is not worth the bother to buy. There is no way you can control the flow. When you do attempt to apply it, it's so thick and powdery, you look like a clown. Stick to the regular jar. ",4
I love Bare Escentuals products. This Ruby collection is so pretty and so much fun. I love to foil the products and use as eyeliner. The mascara is subtly beautiful--i love how smoothly the mascaras always go on. And adding the ruby glitter to it is so fun. ,4
"I love Bare Minerals, but the colors shown on this website do not accurately depict the actual color of the product. The ""Lust"" color is a shimmery light blue (think 70's blue eye shadow) vs. the gray color shown and the description of ""brushed silver."" ",2
I love BE Mineral Veil - it has just been difficult to take along - this really works - especially in the car at Traffic Lights!!! !!! Says it is not refillable -- if so I would recommend they fine tune so it can be refilled. ,3
"I love Benefit and I hate to say a word against it, but despite the quality and performance of the product, it does dry out/go bad too soon and is a little expensive considering. It's a nice rich black, but it sometimes clumps and it does smudge.\nSorry, Benefit :(",0
I love Benefit products but this just wasnt for me. Im very fair and I just couldnt see this on my face or under the eyes no matter how much I put on. It may work on those with darker skin but not here. Its a very pretty light pink and comes in the cutest little ball. The brush is useless so try a concealer brush. I would suggest trying it (and getting a sample ) at a store before buying online. ,2
"i love Benefit's Maybe Baby. it's one of my favorite daytime scents for the office. it's a peachy-floral scent to me, that i really like. i pair it with the matching lotion for extremely long lasting staying power. ",2
"I love BE products. The mini sizes are really wonderful; if you're familiar with BE, the jars are a little smaller than the regular-size eyeshadows. So you're getting a great deal, and the colors are really pretty. Plus the little brushes and mirrored kit is nice, too. The one downside: it doesn't come with the BE foundation/mineral powder -- which I think you need in order to use the rest of BE. ",3
"I love black eyeliner and wear it just about everyday. This did not have long staying power, the color faded, and is too thick for precision lining. Just way too much hype.......not at all something I would buy again. ",1
"I love Bliss products and this one is no exception, slather it on right out of a bath or shower while your skin is damp, and you will enjoy this amazzzzzing soft skin all day, and the lemon smell is jost sooooo delightful. A must have this season ",2
"I love Blondie by Nars. It's works with everything, stays on and is not like the color online. It's a soft brown/green and looks delicious. I just wish that all shadows had space in the containr for a brush. It is SO inconvenient to look for or dedicate a brush to all colors. ",4
"I Love Bronze -N- Brighten! It is so quick and easy! I even use this in the place of foundation a lot of times. I Love to use this when I am in a rush! Not too dark, not too light...perfect complexion enhancer! Gives the right amount of color and glow!! Great for all skin tones! Looks great with Laura's other baked products! ",0
I love Carol's Daughter Loc Butter enough to purchase one for home use and to take my hairstylist. It provides the needd moisture for maintaining a neat care for look to my loicks. Thumbs up to this product. I receive compliments on my hair from young and older women. ,4
"I love clinique but was dissapointed alittle after i used this for a first time. The good thing about this is, it is a relaxing facial, it doesn't have a harsh smell. It didn't exfoliate as well as I thought it would. And it dries my skin out . I would recommand it for someone with oily skin, but thats it. ",0
"I love clinique products, but this 15 minute facial wasn't what i hoped it to be. The good thing about the facial is it doesn't sting, not bad smelling, and is relaxing. For me it didn't deliever the results I thought it would. ",0
"I love colognes and perfumes and this is, by far, my favorite scent. It's light and not cloying, which I prefer, as I don't like my fragrance to overwhelm others or to announce my arrival into a room. I live in South Florida where the weather is usually hot , but I've also worn it in New York mid-winter, during the day. Always elegant and classy. If they ever discontinued it, I would be very sad. ",3
I love Cosmedicine's products so I figured I would love this product b/c I have problem skin. But I wasn't impressed. It didn't seem to help at all. I went back to using their Medi-Matte lotion and I'm much happier w/that. ,2
"I love cover FX. I have melasma, dark spot on my face, and this is the only foundation that cover the spots. It's not heavy, I don't have to wear concealer!! looks pretty natural, I feel free !! I drove from Hermosa beach all the way to Hollywood just to get my cover FX. Sephora should carry these in all the store for people who suffer rosacea and melasma. This products is fantastic!! ",2
"I love ""done"" eyebrows But, sometime I need to get out of the house! I dont always have time to use the template for the brows and the powder. This brow gel gives you a little color and lots of holding power. It keeps those hairs in place, No problem.",2
"I love dramatic eyes so I was very excited to try this, but after I put it on, I wanted to take it right off. It collects at the base of my lashes and makes them look very short and stumpy. I like being able to add more for extra length or volume, but I cant do that with this mascara because it clumps so easily.",0
"I LOVED the baked marble eyeshadow that had purchased previously, so decided to try another color. Didn't really like the other colors that I've tried. However, I gave it a 4, because I really, really like the first color I purchased. I have the Forest Mist and LOVE that one. The Amethyst did nothing for my coloring. Sent that one back. ",4
"I loved the brush on this, it truly enables you to get at all your lashes. The formula was liquid enough that it didn't seem to clump or anything. I didn't think that it curled much at all. Also, this shmeared at any tiny touch, which doesn't work well for me, and it isn't even a little bit water resistant. I tend to be hard on my eyes so I won't say that it won't work for anyone, but it doesn't work for me. I would love to see this brush with a new formula though. ",1
"I loved the clean, frech scent of this perfume and got lots of compliments on it. However, I noticed after wearing it 2 days in a row that it was triggering migraines, so unfortunately I had to stop using it.",1
I loved the color it is great. Only problem if you have arthritis and try to open the container when you finally get it opened the powder is all over the place. I'm hoping with time it wiill be easier to open. It goes on beautifully. A great green for people in to green like me. ,4
"I loved the convenience of buying everything I needed to create the ""smoky eye"" look in one box that was priced lower than each product would have been if purchased separately. The brush made application very easy and fit in my hand perfectly! The mascara glided on and separated each lash. Cargo is a first-class brand! ",4
I loved the original DDMC but could not use it due to my oily acne prone skin. I have been using this for over a year and I love it. This gel moisturizes and does not make me breakout. I use it twice daily and reccomend it highly.,2
"I loved these two products. The aroma is wonderful. The body butter texture is creamy, and has more substance than a regular lotion. Perfect for winter! It is easily absorbed into the skin. The shower gel didn't suds up as well because of our hard water, but I liked it. By layering the gel and then the butter, my skin smelled wonderful all day. These two products smell good enough to eat! ",4
"I loved the way this smelled in the magazine sample, but when I tried it at home it smelled nothing like the sample in the magazine. I wore it to work and asked a few of my co-workers what they thought of it and they really could not smell much of anything. Very dissapointed. ",3
"I loved this anti-aging serum! Last time I was at Sephora, I was told there was new packaging and sold contour cream eyes and lips, which comes in a .5 oz. white tube. It is NOT the same. Can I return this and get the REAL stuff. It works so much better for me. ",4
I loved this cream! It will make the driest of hands soft and smooth in one application. The softness remains after a few hand washings. This will take up permanent residence in my purse and stashed in my coffee table during the long dry winter months ahead! ,1
I loved this mascara in the discontinued Taupe shade. It was perfect for very fair skin. It looked natural. I bought up as much as I could of my shade. But wish more companies would think of fair-skinned women and make lighter shades of mascara. Black and dark brown shades are not good for us. ,4
I loved this product and the final results that it gave my finished makeup. This powder gave me a flawless finish along with a nice mattifying touch. It did not change the colors of the products I used. Only one negative...the smell. It was a bit strong ,2
"I loved this scent in the store, and I enjoy wearing it for the most part. Although, every now and then I think it smells a little bit like my boyfriend's cologne, which I don't really like. It is a good blend of fruit and citrus without being to intense or overly sweet. Cute bottle too. I bought this one along with G, and I go between the two of them. ",0
"i love everything but the mascara, it just didn't do it for me, but the some kinda gorgeous literally erases my pores! the benetint is equally amazing giving me a nice rose-y glow. the eye bright is nice under my regular concealer. ",0
"i love eyeshadow, but i work a job were i tend to sweat at least a little every night, and i have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes, this product makes it so none of that matters, i NEVER reaply anymore, i can look just as fresh now at the end of the night as i did that morning. fantastic product for eye shadow junkies! also, i rub it all around my eye area, and it helps hide the genetic dark circles under my eyes :)",0
"I love fberwig mascara it has these tiny particles that coat each of your lashes and you can keep building the lash out so it looks like extensions. The best part is that it's smear proof! I can wear it all day and not have to worry about wiping underneath my eyes. Then at night with just a little bit on water it comes all off. That's it no more stinging eyes from eyemakeup remover, no more panda eyes from trying to remove the mascara either! Simply the best! ",1
I love Guerlain kiss kiss lipsticks. Their very long wearing and don't dry out my lips. Rose Entetant 569 is a very natural rose color. It makes your lips look flushed with a little shine. I'll repurchase. ,4
i love hard candy lip gloss! way back in the day this company had the most innovative colors and glitters that you could find in cosmetics. but that was then and this is now and there is sooooo much competition! ,2
"I love having this in my bag at work, school and wherever. It is so nice when it's hot and dry. It rehydrates my makeup and you can really see how much of a difference a little moisture makes. This is a must have.",0
"I love HHB by CD. I use a little and it moistures my hair very well and is helping it grow. I have naturally kinky coarse 4B/4A/?? hair and works on it all. I also use CD hair balm, Lisa Exlixar, black vanilla leave-in and Tui Hair Smoothie. I love the CD line and need to buy more, almost out. Just a note... I also switch up products every so often so my hair does not get use to one product and I co-wash mainly. Works on some peole hair, but not all. I suggest testing in store 1st or see if you can get sample from store to make sure you like it. I love it, but I tested on hair in store 1st and then waited a few days... Also I like the scent.... ",2
"I love highlighting and I do like this product for the most part because it gives you two sizes and shapes of applicators. But, I find that the powder applies thickly and does flake, so it needs to be blended. Also, this is a bright white, so darker complexions be careful with applying too much. It's fine for me and my fair to light complexion. I know, I know. It's a highlighter, but there are highlighters that are more subtle. I'll keep this and use it to make my eyes pop when needed. ",4
"I love how clean my face is after using it and it for sure gets ALL my make-up off. My skin feels a little dry afterward, but not sure if it's because it's winter in the desert or it's just that drying. However, I'm willing to work with it and see! ",2
"I love how nice my skin feels after using this. The Guava scent was ok, but i can't get along with the Fig. It's not sicky sweet which is great (none of the scents that i have tried are overly sweet), but it has a note in there that just reminds me of something bad smelling. The Spearmint, however was AWESOME. I agree that there could be a bit more product for the price. ",1
I love how this lip stain makes my lips look naturally redder without being caked on like some lipsticks. There is a bit of waste in the way it is ditributed into the brush but I still think it is well worth it. ,4
"I love how this shampoo makes my hair feel! Every time my hair dries after washing it I can't stop running my fingers through it. This shampoo makes hair very noticeably soft and smooth and, of course, glossy. ",0
"I love how you just tap and buff the foundation on your face. I get my make up on fast and easy now! Great coverage too. Where else can you get foundaton, powder, SPF protection and concealer all in one!! ",3
I love Hypnotic Poisonmore than any other ! I always get the most compliments while wearing it. My only complaint is they need to redesign the bottle because you can never get the last drops .Because of the shape of the glass on the very bottom. You can see that you still have a bit left but you can't get it.,4
I love it so much!! I am not a huge lipstick wearer. I usually stick to lipgloss but I recieved a sample of this and fell in love. I ordered it in Pastel Shine and wear it literally every single day! It's so lightweight it does not feel like lipstick at all and the color is so beautiful it goes with almost everything. ,1
"I love Juice products. I love their scent, and I love that this company cares about their ingredients. I bought this item in hopes it would reduce redness in my sensitive, 'mixed up' Irish skin. while it moisturized a little- it has a serum-like consistency- I did not notice any redness reduction. I discovered that I needed a denser moisturizer to improve this condition. two stars for a wonderful scent and slight moisturizing ability. ",2
"I love just about anything from NARS. I like this blush alot, but the glitter does go all over the place. I'll still use though because it's pretty even with tje glitter in places other than the cheeks. ",4
"I love Kat, but this shadow went back to Sephora. The sparkles in the sparkly side when everwhere on my face except my eyelids. Packaging is awesome...but I wasn't impressed. I think I'm going to try the lipstick instead. ",1
"I love Kat's colors. This is the second set of colors I have purchased. I also have the blue/silver combo. Both I and my 20 year old daughter love all the colors. They wear all day and the colors are rich and beautiful. A little goes a long way, you can control the intensity with the amount of product you use. I also use these with a wet liner brush to make eyeliner with them. Great product!!!! ",3
"I love Lancome quads (even the sample ones!). The colors are extraordinary. Highly pigmented, smudgeable, blendable, applies easily and lasts all day! The quads are always coordinated perfectly so that each vibrant color easily compatible with each other. I use my own brushes to apply the colors but the applicators are handy when you're on the go with this cute palette. Definitely worth it! ",0
"I LOVE Laura's Blush and Brightens! They are so pretty and sooo natural looking! I own honey dipped, pink grapefruit, apricot, sunswept, and etheral rose! They all seem to have the perfect amount of pigments and highlights! So natural and pretty!! Honey dipped works as an AWESOME bronzer..soooo natural looking and makes you glow! I Self tan so I love using Honey Dipped as my bronzer with sunswept, apricot, or pink grapefruit as my blush for a sunkissed look!! Etheral Rose gives a healthy glow as an all over face color!! **LAUVE** all of Laura's bakes! ",0
"I love light, floral fragrances but was disappointed with Pure Grace Soap and Water on myself. It has a musky undertone and the longer I wore it, the more pronounced it became. This is a bit pricey to smell like musky, soap and water. ",4
"I LOVE lip gloss and I read ALL the reviews for all the holiday lip gloss sets and chose the Croc Mocktail collection. Sadly, I was really disappointed. I find the colors too teeny bopper for my taste. I think I'm going to slip the little guys into my 13 year old's Christmas stocking. ",3
"I love lipstick and don't leave home without it. This one is fabulous and I have tried them all. Wonderful color, it feels good on your lips and lasts a long time. Hard to get both qualities in one lipstick. And the case is great!",4
"I love liquid eyeliner, but its a time taker. I LOVED THIS, but the 'cake' went dry, after about a week, worse each day. I tried to revive it with MANY other products meant for dry liners to set up, etc: BE, Paula Dorf, etc.-no luck. I even bought it twice, but even putting the lid on, after each swipe, (!)- the cake still..went dry.. on two separate jars. I will pay the high price, but I expect long life, or at least a few months! ",4
I love love looooove this cleanser. A Sephora beauty advisor suggested this to me and I am so glad I took his advice. This cleanser smells fresh and it makes your skin feel and look clean. If I didn't wear liquid eyeliner I wouldn't need any eye makeup remover. This cleanser will take off your makeup and your mascara. If you wear liner then it takes a little extra. I love the size because you don't find yourself running out constantly. This is the best cleanser ive ever used.,1
"I love, love, love Baby Doll. I love the bottle, a pink jewel with a mind of its own. I love the fragrance. fresh with just sliced grapefruit, then softly sweet with powdery notes that are neither cloying nor artificial smelling. it makes me want to skip like a 13-year-old. I love it. but: it absolutely will not last on my skin. it's just GONE, within half an hour. my skin tends to be like this with a lot of fragrances. I adore philosophy's Falling In Love, and that disappears within about 30 minutes, too. if only, if only! Baby Doll came in an eau de parfum formulation. but I do recommend this product, especially if, like me, you enjoy sweeter, fruit-scented fragrances without them being too cloying. oh well... ",2
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing. Since I bought it, it has been my favorite beauty item! I have reddish blondish hair and eyebrows so it is hard for me to find an eyebrow pencil that looks natural. This one looks GREAT. It is not harsh and it makes your brows look professional. The brush on the end is awesome too!",0
"I love, love, love perfume. I started wearing them when I was 13 and long before I started wearing makeup. I don't feel fully dressed unless I have a scent on. And I hate it when my scent wears off, especially during the summer when I wear lighter eau de toilettes. This is perfect for me. It's also perfect if you plan to go out after work and want to wear a scent that is not office appropriate. ",1
"I love, love, love this blush! I bought the original orgasm color. I have received compliments every day about my healthy glow. This is the first time I have used and NARS products and I was not disappointed.",1
"I love, love, love this Caulk pencil. I used it first after an international flight back to the states. A friend I was travelling with let me try it and I was sold right then and there. I went straight to Sephora and purchased my own and have been using it ever since. I keep it in my lipstick bag in my purse and put it on just as I walk out the door and then if I need it during the day I have it as well...a perfect solution to a long day when you can't get home to refresh your makeup. My mascara does not move while I am wearing this and it blends in so naturally. I may never go without this product again. My last trip for a facial, my aesthetician told me that I had a bit of a problem with undereye circles but that I did such a good job with my makeup we would not need to focus on that area!!!!Thanks Laura Geller! ",2
"I love, love, LOVE this conditioner. The first time I used it, it made my hair super silky and shiny. It's very creamy, and smells nice too. It also helps to keep my color, though since I also use the technician shampoo and regular conditioner I can't really say which one contributes the most to keeping my color fresh. But compared with when I use the regular conditioner (which is on a daily basis), the one time a week I use the mask it is noticeably softer and shinier. If you color your hair, DEFINITELY use this, it's well worth the money! ",2
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this elixar!!! I was never really into the whole toner thing, but this is one of the best products I've used. It is refreshing, makes my skin glow and fell like silk, and smells lovely!!! I can't live without it now!!",2
"I love, love, love this. Great purchase. It is shimmery without being cheap looking. The underlying beige color is a great neutral that I use on my upper eyelid for a base. I will definitely buy more colors. ",3
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this...It makes my skin soft and the scent is incredible. It lasts all day and I don't have to use another lotion or cream when I use this AND the scent is so nice that you don't need perfume or body spray. This is one of my favorite products that I always have to have!! ,1
"I love, love, love this product. It brightens the area underneath the eyes so well that I sometimes do not even apply any makeup over it. I also use it on other areas of my face, like the lines between eyebrows, frown lines, etc. before applying bare minerals makeup. ",4
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It works on piecing short pixie, spiky hair, but leaves it pliable enough not to stab folks. It works on bobs, layered or one length. It helps make your hair shiny, not MATTE like most pieceing products. It only takes a tiny amount, and I work it in while still damp. I have used it dry, but do not recommend it, for folks with bobs, or slightly longer hair. (unless you want the dirty piecey look that appears greasy) I like the scent alot. Most products have such a strong odor, or none at all. It smells natural and also does not make your head itch, like alot of other products tend to do. You will love this product. Buy IT! ",3
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!! I use the medium and it works perfectly as a smooth foundation for me. It does just what it's name says. It balances the uneven spots and skin tones on my face, without being too heavy. Also, it actually does brighten my complexion and my whole appearance. I just gave it to my sister for her birthday a month ago. She LOVES it! All she has ever used is a liquid foundation--she couldn't believe the light feeling, non-greasy feel on her face when she used it as a foundation! I really love Laura Geller's baked products the best. She keeps coming out with more colors for face and eyes. I always keep a spare Medium Balance-N-Brighten on hand---just in case. One thing that makes it work better for me is a full, but still flexible synthetic brush. I suggest trying to find such a brush at Sephora, and don't forget their professional Platinum line of brushes--I love those too! Bottom line--try Laura Geller's Medium Balance-N-Brighten, you've got nothing to lose but an uneven skin tone on your face! ",3
"I love, love, love this product. The scent is wonderful and my hair has never been in better condition. I have long, straight, fine hair so I only use one small drop in my palm, rub my hands together and then work it in to the ends of my dry hair before using my flat iron. My hair ends up silky and my ends don't get fried from the heat. Any product left on your hands can be rubbed on legs or arms. Also good to put a drop or two before bed time and shampoo out in the morning... I always recommend this to friends. It's the BEST! ",3
"I love love love this retractable lip brush! It's soo easy to use,and you can carry it with you in your purse to apply while on the go. The brush jus pops out when you pull it and goes right back in when you push it. The brush is soft and doesn't get hard like other brushes. ",0
"I love love love this stuff. I received it initially in a fashion week gift bag two years ago, and have been using it (and converting friends!) ever since. It doesn't make you look orange, doesn't smell terrible, and has this great shimmering effect to it that does wonders to bruised up legs- lol. A helpful hint if you're strak prone or don't like as much sparkle: apply it directly after a shower on damp skin. It will go on more evenly and naturally, you'll use less, and it won't rub off on your clothes as much. ",0
"i love love love this stuff on my 5th bottle if not more than that it smells great, doesn't weigh my fine hair down, rinses clean, and moisturizing and helps so that hair is less frizzy -- i put it on as a styling cream too or overnight treatment and it works well always. i've even used it as a body lotion. it is the best stuff ever. ",2
"I Love, love, the beautiful glow this products gives my skin, and the gold flecks are just an added bonus. Great for day and evening wear. It compliments black skin so beautifully, I'm what some would call a light-skinned African-American and its amazing on me. ",2
"I love love this lipgloss! It has a great little brush to apply it with, and it has a great vanilla type smell. It is not goopy at all, the the color is very pretty over just a lipliner. I really think anyone would love it! ",2
"I love Luce and will not be without it. This product is not a conditioner or detangler, so don't take away stars if it doesn't condition or detangle--it's not supposed to. Luce gave me glossy, soft, manageable hair for days. Once a week is enough for me, so the price per application is not bad, either. Follow the directions, and it will probably do the same for you. Also, liking the scent is a matter of taste. In this case, it's strong and salon-like, but will fade after a while. I don't find it unpleasant. ",3
"I love Makeup Forever, however I was quite disappointed with this product! It is far too messy, the powder flies everywhere. I also found that it made my skin look really white (even though it's supposed to be for all skin tones). I never used it again. ",0
"I love Mania! I would give it five stars if I didn't have to use so much to get it to last. I wish Sephora would offer a scented lotion for layering. It's a scent that can be worn winter or summer. I choose winter, since I like more citrusy scents for summer. ",4
"I love MJ, so it was no surprise I would love this. My boyfriend loves it, my mom loves it, none of my coworkers have complained (like someone did when I wore a heavier perfume), I've gotten a lot of compliments. The only issue I had, was deciding whether or not to get the bottle, or the gift set! I really hate perfumed lotion in general, but I LOVE the little perfumed ring, so I'll buy that on its own.",0
"I love Mr. Frosty, I can't help it. I like how large it is compared to a traditional eye-liner sized pencil, it allows you to apply as much or as little as you want depending on the angle you are using it. The shimmer is subtle enough to not look ridiculous but still adds a nice touch to your face. I love Benefit... I am a huge fan of their products. ",0
"i love MUFE so it kinda pains me to give a mediocre review. i bought this after trying the 2 purple colors on my hand one day at Sephora. they wouldn't budge, i rubbed hard and that stuff didn't budge. it didn't come off of my hand until i washed with soap. needless to say, i was impressed and had to have the liner in black. well, i'm not as impressed anymore. i only line my waterline, and even though nothing is 100% budgeproof on me down there, this is absolutely one of the worst, i've ever used on my waterline. it SMUDGES and FAST!!! i'm sure this may do better on my upper lid, so i give it 3 stars, but since i don't line up there, this isn't worth the money at all for me. it is a nice dark black though, and glides on super easy, even though i have to do a few passes to get it super dark. will use it up but won't repurchase. ",1
"I love my lil shaver. Its a great purchase. It shaves nicely and the charge holds forever. Its such a cool tool! The epilator scares me, but I guess I'll give it another try. I have bought so many cheap ones from other places and I am glad i found this product. Go for it! ",1
I love my lip products and this one especially. Such a yummy flavor and glides on smoothly. It's not sticky and it adds just the right amount of gloss. I love how it makes my lips feel. It hydrates while it shines. ,1
I love NARS blush for its high pigmentation and staying power. I just got Desire and like it better than the ever-popular Orgasm because it gives a nice matte pink when applied with a light hand. Wish O came in matte!,4
"I love NARS eyeshadow. The color combinations are so beautiful, and since the pigment is so intense the duo will last a long time. What you see is what you get when it comes to the color in the box- that's exactly how it will appear on your eyes. As much as I like the colors, I find the glimmer shadows to be almost too glittery. It's definitely great for night-time wear, but I don't think it was intended for daytime. Try any color combo and you will be hooked! ",0
I love Nars! It's the perfect pink gold glowing color for fair skin girls. It melts into your skin and gives you the perfect color. I've been using this blush for over 2 years and have yet too find another that could replace it!,0
"I love NARS lipstick in ""Funny Face"" It's long-lasting and keeps my lips moist although it's a matte color, don't get me wrong it's not cheap but its well worth it. It works really well for people who wear alot of black such as myself & it looks great 4 club night!!!",0
"I love Ojon products. I've bought almost everything they offer, so I was willing to splurge for this kit. I really didn't see the promised results, though. My hair really isn't any thicker or healthier than before the two-month ritual. It isn't a bad product, but for those who would be stretching the budget for this, you might want to stick with their other products. ",2
"I love orange colored lipstick. This is a great orange shade-not peach, not coral, ORANGE. I was pleasantly surprised that the color was what I wanted. I have another Yves Saint Laurent lipstick that is more of a coral color and love it but it just was not ORANGE. ",4
"I love Orlando Pita. The T3 Iron Boost is one of my favorite straightening products, so I had high hopes for this hair-plumping one. Alas, it was not meant to be. My bra-strap-length hair had no more body after a blowout with this stuff than if I had used nothing at all. Might work or shorter hair. Ah, well. ",1
"I love perfume and got this as a sample from Sephora. I loved it so much, I had to have it no matter the cost. It smells so sophisticated, rich, and luxurious. I have told friends it makes me feel very important. I've had several people ask what it is and I'm pleased to introduce them to a scent they haven't heard of before.",1
"I love Philosophy in general, and I love these body washes. They leave your skin moistuized and silky. The only reason I gave this one 4 stars instead of five is that out of the different scents I've used this is not as fragrant as the others. Not that I should walk around smelling like a big cake, but I like a light lingering sweet smell. This one did not have that. If that is not important to you, than please proceed with purchasing this or any of these body washes. My favorite so far is senorita margurita.",1
"I love Philosophy lip shines and have more of them than I can count. I really like this one. It tastes like a yummy red velvet cake (love that chocolate!) and although it looks dark in the tube, it goes on a sheer, very pretty color that looks great on my light skin. I highly recommend this one to anyone. ",3
I love Philosophy products and this item is no exception. The smell is out of sight--I am a huge margarita fan and this stuff doesn't disappoint on authentic smell. It has the fresh citrus-y lime smell that really invigorates.I love the cute and intelligent packaging of all Philosophy products and who doesn't love a great new recipe??,1
"I love philosophy products, especially their Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash and Hope in a Bottle. I had high hopes that Save Me, with its litany of great ingredients, would repair and rejuvenate my skin. while it was moisturizing with a light texture and a divine citrus scent, I saw no changes to match the product's claims. I'll stick with Peter Thomas Roth's Mega Rich Intensive Creme, which DOES 'turn back the clock' on my crow's feet and smoothes my skin. [another plus from using the Microdelivery Wash: it helps your moisturizer work much more effectively by gently removing dead cells on facial skin, allowing your cream or serum to better absorb and nourish.] philosophy does make wonderful products, and I will try any new item they launch; when they get it right, it really shows. this product just didn't perform, at least not for me. ",2
"I love Pure Grace and it's ""soap and water"" scent. You may wonder why you shouldn't just buy soap instead, but this fragrance is more refined than just soap. It also has a great consistency, foams up quickly and is so moisturizing that I don't even need to use body lotion... but I do! I love to layer this with the body lotion and smell like ""Pure Grace"" all day!",2
I love Pure Grace's clean and fresh sent. It isn't overpowering. I ballroom dance and almost every time I go dancing the men are telling me how good I smell. Other places I go I frequently receive statements of how good I smell by people around me.,4
i love purity. it does everything it says it will do and leaves my skin feeling clean clean clean - but not dry. i use it with hope in a jar moisturizer and it is a great system. I would give it five stars but I think the $20 price tag is a tiny bit high.,2
"I love putting this product on my chest area to even out the skin tone and give a little color. Since it leaves a bit of a ""wet"" look, I use Bare Escentuals mineral veil over it after it dries a bit. ",3
"I love smashbox and was very excited to try this product. I have combination skin. I bought the primer with Dermaxyl in it. It has a nice smooth consistency. I didn't like that it took a long time for it to fully absorb into my skin. I couldn't apply powder for quite a while. It was still too moist. And it took longer to absorb on warm days. Summer was the worst for absorption. Not recommended for people who do their makeup in a rush. If you only have 5 minutes to do your face and be out the door, this is a bad idea. But once it absorbed, I did like it. It was very smoothing. I did not find it to be lightweight. It was fine where I have dry skin but it was a little too heavy/moisturizing in my oily areas. I could not use a moisturizer underneath it. I also wish it was a higher spf and it was a bit pricey. It didn't live up to the hype on MY skin. But if you are patient and have the time to wait for it to absorb, it may work really well for you. I don't recommend it for those with oily skin.",1
"I LOVE Smashbox lip glosses! Other lip glosses always claim to be non-sticky or non-tacky, but they usually are. Smashbox glosses don't give you that sticky-gloss feeling and last a long time. The best out there! I have several colors, but I also have it in Crystal, which is a clear and is a PERFECT coordinate for any lipstick. ",1
"I love Stella. I also own the fragrance spray. But this lotion, although it has the same wonderful scent, it also has a slight plastic smell. I assume it comes from the plastic bottle. I noticed it so much, I had to get over it to use the lotion. But I do use it now so that's why I gave it 3 stars, because the Stella fragrance does come through, and it is a nice, rich cream. ",2
"I love ""Sugar"" by Fresh and my husband (who dislikesn oticable frgrances) loves it too! This is sweet but light, feminine and modern... oh please make a smaller size like Sugar Lemon. I used to buy the $50 bottle but now this is the only option!?! ",4
"I LOVE Sugar Slicks!!!! They are not sticky. They taste super yummy, without being sickly sweet, and they last a long time. This is a great opportunity for you to try this line. It also makes a great stocking stuffer for a teen. ",1
"I love sweet perfumes, and this one is perfect. It smells like a sophisticated version of cotton candy, but is not childish or cloying like some sweet perfumes. I have pretty much everything, the shower gel, the perfume, etc. because I like to layer it all.",1
"I love sweet scents, but this one is just way over the top! When I first sprayed it on, I could not stop coughing b/c the smell was just overpoweringly SWEET! It smelled like my whole body was smeared in Carmel, yuck!",0
I love that the NARS blushes are so versatile. You can wear them dramaticly as colourful as they look or you can wear them very sheer for a romatic look. Because they are made out of finely powder they last all day.,0
i love that these blotting films don't leave a powdery residue. i use these everyday in the middle of the afternoon to remove oil off my forehead and nose. i gave this 4 stars 'cuz i think the packaging should be a hard case with refillable papers. ,2
"I love that this has spf, I'm really big on that. However, this has also helped dramatically reduce puffiness and wrinkles with consistant use. You need only a very little every day, so the jar lasts quite a long time. I like to combine it with Juice Beauty eye products which contain vitamin K for dark circles. ",3
"I love that you get to try 7 of the ""best-selling"" mascaras for a fraction of the price. Some of them were awful and some were great!!! I guess that was the point! . I loved the Smashbox bionic, Benefit bad gal, and Blinc Kiss Me. ",1
"I love the 2 eyeshadow shades included in this kit, but the brush applies in a messy way that does NOT make a smoky eye easier.I tried several times with no success. Do yourself a favor, get BE's original Smoky Eye kit, and buy these shades separately to use with THAT brush. As a major BE junkie this kit was a HUGE disappointment for me. ",3
"I love the Amazing Grace Bath, Shampoo, and Shower Gel. I use it as a light bubble bath. The smell is perfect. It's light, not too flowery...just a light soft scent that's not over powering or cheap smelling. I've tried alot of bath bubbles, milks, etc. and Amazing Grace is my favorite. It's both relaxing and rejuvenating. I enjoy taking the travel size with me on trips instead of using the harsh hotel soaps. It's definitely worth trying.",2
"I love the Bare Escentuals line. I have dry skin and the powders are great. I use the summer bisque, a little faux tan, mineral veil and then a touch of soft focus. My sister Janet turned me onto this stuff and as my niece says, ""Bare Escentuals is a religion and lovers of it try to convert everyone!""",4
I love the bare minerals products. I have been using the bare minerals makeup for almost two years and it really is good for your skin. People are always commenting on my makeup and how smooth my skin is and guess me to be 10 years younger than I am.,4
"I love the Blandi line (I just wish they came in the salon size!). This mist is great for restyling and leaves a beautiful smell. The only reason I knocked a star off is I need to be careful on where I apply this, to much near my roots and my hair will look SUPER greasy, and my hair doesn't get oily quickly. ",0
"I love the brush and the mascara is terrific!!! I hope the brush style catches on. I will keep this one forever. I do however feel the price of this mascara is outrageous, but when I'm hooked on something I stick to it! Which is why I tried this mascara, I could not find that perfect one, until now. My eyes are Aqua and the intense black really makes them stand out. I have spent a small fortune waiting for Phenomen'Eyes mascara.!! ",3
I LOVE the Buxom lip glosses from BE. The Diamond Lips collection does not deliver the same tingle as original Buxom. Gloss is tacky and heavier than original formula. They also switched to a brush which I do not care for. I prefer the sponge tip applicator. ,3
I love the Buxom Lips line so much I've purchased almost every flavor! They go on smoothly and are wonderful. They really do plump you lips a bit. Not overly sticky like most plumping lip glosses. GREAT PRODUCT!! ,3
"I love the color and feel of this lipstick, however, it is softer than other brands and the second time I used it, it broke! Fortunately, I was able to stop it from falling and was able to roll it down. Use it gently, so it doesn't break off. ",4
"I love the color of the product, but I don't like the applicator pen. It is hard to squeeze just enough for coverage. It usually takes me a few times. Also, product tends to make my lips feel a bit dry after using. ",1
"I love the color of this product. Easy to use and dries quickly. If I am nice to my nails they stay undamaged for quite some time, but if I'm doing a lot of cleaning or whatever, the product obviously chips and such. ",1
"I love the colors. Colors go on nice with brush I have white and blue and they blended very well together. I created a blue and white eye. The white is beautiful with just a liner also. I used Stila gel liner with #28 brush. I tap my MAC 252 brush after dipping in Dust. I then applied it. I had less Dust fall when I did that. I plan to try to see if I can also use wet like MAC pigments. My MAC pigments are more pigmented, but I still like NP Loose Eye Dust for the price. I love the size of the containers also. They are easy to store and also easy to travel with. Overall a good product. I would buy more if available. ",2
"I love the colors especially the base silver 1980's. But, the price for what you get isnt amazing. Instead I would recommend going to the Bare Escentuals eye shadow and buying similar colors. Your size per price would go right up. Its not really a tutorial it just says put a here b here and c here. It takes a good half hour just to get each eye even :""( so i rarely wear it. But it looks amazing and lasts quite a while. ",0
"I love the colors in this collection! My favorite is the White Gold Eyecolor. It is especially great for me because I am so fair and it offers a subtle sparkle base for my eyelids. The Wicked Eyecolor and the RSVP Blush work so well with each other and the Maple Syrup Lipcolor all are so perfect for my fair skin. This collection proves that less is more. Also, the brushes are fabulous! ",4
I love the colors in this compact. I am always looking for green eye shadow. There are not many out there. Or the colors are off a little as to what you want. You have so many ways you can mix the colors and still look great. The colors glide on easily and stay on all day. I love them if you have Hazel or green eyes you will love these colors in the compact. ,4
"I love the colors of the Lana lipsticks. They are sexy without being overwhelming on a fair skinned girl like me. The color doesn't last all day, but the reapplication is forgive for the cuteness of the tube! ",1
I love the consistency and texture of this product. It's not sticky at all and is not as shiny as a traditional lip gloss. It feels amazing on my lips and gives a soft shimmery-shine. I wear it all the time and love it. ,0
I love the coverage of this foundation. It is grat when used with the HD powder. I don't care for it with HD Make Up For Ever primer-it is too visiible with that. I like the Smashbox primer with it better. ,2
"I love the design and color. I love UD lipstick, so I can see using for the long term. Also works great since the containers look the same. I can identify my favorite for the week, month with this cap. A must have for UD lovers.... ",2
"I love the ease in using this product, and the effectiveness of the exfoliation side. I of course use the balm side up befroe the exfol side, but who cares. It is a great product. Convienient, effective. I use it at bedtime. ",4
I love the ease of a shower gel and shampoo in one. It shortens my showring time when I need to take a quick shower. It lathers really well and makes me feel clean from head to toe. I really like the scent of this product - not too overpowering. I can't wait to try some of the other scents.,2
I love the eyeshadow quality and colors. It looks great on with a little sheen to really show off the eyes and you get several colors to mix and match. The top of the compact has a mirror making it great for touch ups! However it is a bit expensive therefore only 4 stars. ,0
I love the face powders. I actually put the balance and brighten over a light foundation and it is the best look I've ever had. The eyeliner works very nicely when I wet the brush first. That tames down the application and is supposed to make it waterproof. ,4
"I love the fact that I spend so much less time drying my hair and that it leaves my hair so silky and not dried out. It is extremely lightweight and compact and (finally!) has a very long cord. With this dryer, my ghd air brush, and Fekkai glossing cream, my thick, chin-length hair is ready to go in under 10 minutes. It is easily stored because its collapsed size is small. The price is a little numbing, but I decided it was a better buy in the long run than a cheaper dryer. ",4
"I love the fact that it has a firming emulsion for the skin, that's why I purchased it. The smell is really clean but it is a little loud! If I would have known how strong it was it wouldn't have purchased it....Suggestion; Take a sample home and try it first!",2
I love the glow I get from this! I use it under my powder foundation and it keeps my face from looking too matte. Every time I use it I get compliments on how smooth and luminous my complection is! And at 51 I can use all the help I can get! I highly recommend this for women over 40 who have notice their skin starting to look a little dull. ,3
"I love the light tingle this spray gives my skin (without irritating or drying it out). I use it sometimes before applying my makeup to ""wake up"" my tired face in the mornings or after makeup application to set my face powder. If you've put on eye makeup before using it, be sure to cover your eyes so your mascara doesn't smudge.",1
"I love the little purse, which I'm assuming that's what you really paid for, because the glosses are so small. Great colors and quality, but their tiny-I wish they were a little bigger. Overall, I like the glosses. p.s. their quite glittery ",1
"I love the matte finish and it holds up well. I think it definitely works better over a primer though. Without primer, it is hard to blend, I had a hard time around my nose where my pores are larger. With primer, it went on much more smoothly and the pores weren't such an issue. ",4
I love the NARS blush. It is the perfect peachy-pink color for most skin tones. It can be worn very subtle for daytime and dramatic for night. It wears all day and I love the hint or gold sparkel. This product is amazing!,0
"I love the packaging, application, texture, spreadability of these but the gloss itself seems to slip off my lips, even with lipliner both lining my lips and coloring my lips. I wish the gloss had more staying power. ",2
"i love the peach-y scent! it is very light but still does the job on your face, it illuminates, gives little shimmer - perfect amount for a day wear, and my sister said it evens the overall look once you apply it over a powder ",0
"I love the photofinish. It makes my makeup go on smoothly and flawlessly. I got to try it through a little sample packet, and boy am I in love with this stuff! It's worth paying full retail price for. My skin is smoothed out and any make up I apply goes on smooth and makes me look picture perfect!",0
"I love the powder duo, they are great shades and really do sculpt your face. My only gripe is with the brush. It is much too small to use with the darker shade, you end up with a stripe. If you buy this product, make sure to also buy a fan brush to use! ",0
I love the primer and have used it for years. It's the best!! Wanted to take advantage of larger size along with the eye shadows. Look Out!! I'm still trying to get the falling glitter off my face and it's not a pretty sight. Go for the primer but pass on the shadows!! ,4
"I LOVE the product and would give it 5 stars if Korres would work on a better dispenser. The tubes are fine, but the bottle makes it very difficult to extract every last drop. Usually, when lotion gets low, I close the pump, and store the bottle upside down. But this one can't be closed or removed. Maybe it's just me, but the pump is kind of stiff and hard to use, even when full. A simple pump-cap or tube would be more functional. ",3
I love the quality and texture of these glosses.But if you are ordering they are very very small. They do not last a week if you use it daily. That is fine as they do dry up quickly. the clear one dried up on me. But it is a good opportunity to try out shades to see If you want to pay 25 for a full size gloss. ,4
"I love the roll on perfume. It gives you the convenience to carry it along. But, it also has a stronger scent. These fragrances have an aromatheraphy effect. If I am stressing I will put them on my pulse points and they really help me out. try it! You won't be sorry. ",3
"I LOVE these. At first I was sure they were a ""gimmick"" but wanted to try them anyway. Now I have 4 different kits and am actually thinking about discarding my tons of eye shadows ! Yes, they are a little smaller than the average eyelid but that's good. Keeps it from going into your brows or whatever- but when you 1st apply them the finish is very creamy so you can blend or spread it with your finger to extend upward if you want. I really only blend the highlight color upwards a little- the rest is so perfect it doesn't need blended. Once you have the look you want you apply their special powder over it and miraculously the shadow feels like powder, not creme anymore ! I have found it goes on in SECONDS and stays on for HOURS. It takes a long time to get this muliti color, blended effect if you do it yourself with 3-4 colors of shadow. They are difficult to get off the card- I slide a cuticle stick under the ""patch"" and slide the stick to one side to unglue it and then to the other side. That's the best method I have found. I find that each patch works 4 times. (eg. one patch will do your eyes 2ce, the set of 2 patches will do your eyes 4 times.) I just stick them back onto the cardboard under the plastic film till next time. You could get more uses than that but would not have all the detail. I am really loving this product. Can get such a finished makeup look so QUICKLY !! Althought it is expensive I am so happy with the look and the convenience that I think it's worth it. ",3
"I LOVE these, but it did take a few tries to learn how to apply it properly. I think the small pots are just right, since I do my make-up differenly every day, and I would not use a big pot before it dried out. I agree with other reviewers that they should make this in plum. It's crazy that they have green and TWO browns, but no plum. ",2
I love these capsules. It makes it all very easy for me and not a chance of spilling or dropping them. It adds just the right amount of moisture to my skin and the diffierence is quite noticeable. As we lose this acid as we age.....trying this product is a must. ,4
"I love these capsules. They do a great job of eliminating neck lines. I use them on my face and neck, and you can even use them under the eyes. I noticed a definite difference in facial and neck lines when I ran out of them. ",4
"i LOVE THESE EYESHADOWS, I have ahzel eyes and the colors are great they blend well and you can wear them together or separately, I love all the bare minerals eyeshadows as I have oily skin and they stay on all day. You can also go light or darker,wahtever you like!!! ",3
I LOVE these eye shadows. I keep finding more ways to wear them. I can even blend 2 colors for the perfect eyebrow shade. No one makes a good eyebrow color for a natural redhead. They work great as eyeliner and shadow. I have never received so many complements on my eyes! Way to go Kat. ,4
I LOVE these eyeshadows it's the most noticable make up EVER but I do have a problem that it tends to break easily most eyeshadows that I've owned don't break as easily other than that this is by far one of the best eyeshadows ,0
"I love these for when I am working...I work in a restaurant, and keep one of these in my pocket. I can reapply as needed, without carrying around a big lip gloss. They leave my lips shiny and a little pinker than normal. ",1
"I love these glosses! They make your lips tingle within a few minutes of application--as if mint was rubbed on your lips. Very refreshing! In my opinion, the gloss is not clumpy, gooey, too sparkly, or short-lasting. The tingly feeling stays until there is no more gloss left (usually from eating, drinking, or talking too much).\nThe colors are a bit off on this website, but here are the colors I own and what they look like in my opinion: Amber--a beautiful soft peachy color which looks great on basically everyone who has tried it in front of me. Bambi--definitely not a shimmering pink! It's more of an orange-pink and looks rather flat on my lips. Bianca--definitely an orange, but in a good way...not too overpoweringly orange, more of a light tangerine with a bit of shimmer/sparkle. Would look good with turquoise jewlery or sea-blue top. Candi--not a soft berry in my opinion, but more of a muted candy-pink. Looks flat on my lips also. Dolly--a plum for sure, but a soft plum that is actually flattering on most people. The color doesn't look good on me, however, and I'm supposed to have the skin/hair/eye combo that every lip color looks good on, lol. Dominique--one of my faves! A gorgeous clear, sparkly gloss. Definitely not for those who do not like sparkle. But it is nowhere near the glittery-ness of Dior's DiorKiss gloss. Kanani--a gorgeous hot pink that makes your lips pop! I added a pic below, but I don't know how well the color will come across. Gives your face a hint of tropical color. Krystal--amazing clear gloss. You'd think it would be boring, but if you're a fan of C.O. Bigelow's mint gloss, then you'll love this, and love it even more! Trixie--this actually looks more ""berry"" than Candi, and it's gorgeous.\nMy faves are Amber, Trixie, Krystal, Dominique, and Kanani. Wear them everyday!\nAs for plumping, you might think they're plumped right away because of the tingly feeling and because when you look in the mirror, the gloss naturally makes your lips look bigger. However, the actual size of your lips will not increase until you use the glosses just about everyday for a couple weeks or more. This will almost surely give you at least slightly bigger lips. It only minimally to moderately plumps though, so don't expect huge huge lips!\nHappy buying!",0
"I love these GoSMILE touch-ups. I use them after eating something that would typically stain teeth, such as coffee. They make your breath smell great too. However, you really only need to use a half at most at a time and not the whole ampoules as the directions state. ",0
i Love These lashes. This is a very reliable product. I specifily like style #25021 they look glam without looking costumey. I have been buying these lashes for the past 7 years and have never been disappointed. I once strayed and bought a different brand and was disappointed in the product. Make Up For Ever makes the best eyelash strips and they are easy to apply. ,3
"I love these lipglosses. They give your lips a tingly feeling which feels great, the colors are complimentary to any skin tone and are sheer. They give your lips just the right amount of shine and glitter. The only negative is they changed the applicator on these mini versions from the nice sponge-like applicator on the full-size. These come with a dinky brush which makes applications a little awkward. ",3
"I love these lipsticks! I've already reviewed Parfait as the perfect color, perfect lipstick. Bavarian Creme is the perfect pink. Not a shy pink, it has terrific staying power and is good for the lips, they look great. I have found that putting it over the Buxom increases the staying power a lot. This color is not a shy pink, and it's terrific! ",3
"I love these little bottles! There are so many different colors, and the price is so small that you can choose a few to try and not feel badly if you don't like all of them. I particularly appreciate the size for travel--they barely take up any room at all. The quality is excellent, also--very long wearing with reasonable care. ",4
"I love these little things to death! I've tried many other facial cleansing wipes from different brands, trying to find something good for travel or quick cleanup at the end of a long day when I'm just too tired to wash my face properly, and the others have all been disappointing -- sticky, drying, unpleasant fragrances, you name it. The Shiseido sheets cost more than many of the other brands, but they're absolutely wonderful -- the cloths are soft and gentle on your skin, and the fragrance is light and pleasant. They're large and moist enough to effectively remove a full face of makeup, gentle enough to use even around the eyes, and they leave your face feeling soft and clean without any sensation of dryness, tightness, or sticky/oily residue. Great for travel, or a quick cleanup before bed when you don't want to fuss with a traditional rinse-off cleanser. ",2
"I love these matte pencils. I was never a lipstick person, didn't like the feel. These ones are so different. My only request is that they come out with a really dark plum or purple color in these pencils.",3
"I love these pencils. I purchased both sets. Colors are vibrant, smooth, and long lasting. These are perfect if you are just trying them or if you travel alot. They wear well and look gorgeous on. I love this set because the colors are more neutral, but both are great. A must buy and great gift for holidays. ",2
"I LOVE these pencils! They take up so little room I can put my evening colors in my purse, take a quick few minutes in the ladies' and be ready for an evening out.... So easy to use, so long lasting and wow! such a great value. This is my kind of makeup! ",3
I love the Sephora Body Washes. I recenty bought the Citrus Sage scent because I could not pass up the great on-line price. I'm going to hold on to it until Spring or Summer as I think the scent is better suited for that season. ,2
"I love these products in this kit. None of them caused any irritation and all worked perfectly together to clarify my skin. I have tried countless brands (Proactiv, Peter Thomas Roth, Neutragena...) and this IS the BEST. Like it says on the bottle, there is no need to stop using even when skin is clear. You need to try it for yourself. ",2
I love these shadows. They have great pigmentation and blend very well. I did not see any creasing. I used UDPP on eyes 1st. They also last for hours on the eyes. Colors did not fade for at least 7-8 hrs. I will buy again!!!! ,2
"I love these stencils because I can take my time making sure they are just where I want them and they stick on through powdering the brows. I usually do this first, before applying any foundation, with clean skin. They last for many uses with the stick-um good for weeks. There is a tab in the middle of the stencil which I use for guiding proper placement, however, after removing the stencil, you do have to fill in the line it leaves behind. Overall, it's simple and easy to use, especially if you are like me and need an extra hand every once in a while, the stick-um is the extra help I need. ",4
"I LOVE THESE. THE FRAGRANCE ON ALL OF THEM IS WONDERFUL., NOT A BAD ONE IN THE BUNCH, THEY'RE SUPER CUTE TOO. I ACTUALLY GOT A WHOLE SET FOR ME AND GOT ANOTHER SET TO GIVE A WAY AS INDIVIDUAL GIFTS. MY FRIENDS LOVED THESE AS A GIFT. ",1
I love the set - reason for 4 stars is like other reviews- dont care for the delivery system with the night skin revival treatment. Would prefer the brush application for this. the facial cleanser is wonderful - skin feels clean and very soft. ,3
"i love the sheer raspberry color of Sugar Flirt. my lips are pigmented, so sheer pinks just look clear, but Sugar Flirt actually gave me a bit of color. i gave it 4 stars because it's quite expensive for a lip gloss. ",2
"I love the Smashbox Master's Class Volumn 2. What very nice soft colors to bring out the real me!! And, with the help of the DVD, using the items in this set is a breeze. No matter your age, you will find this great group of products to be fun, exciting and natural. ",4
"I love the Smashbox primers. I have been using them for several years. I have found that these primers give a very polished ""flawless"" porcelain effect to the skin. They glide on silky smooth and do not require much time before you can start applying makeup. When using a primer I have found that I don’t use as much makeup and my makeup does not sit in my pores. I really like that they added a ""light"" edition ...which is nice during the summer months. This product makes all the difference,",0
"I love the smell of Pure Grace. It's clean yet feminine. This shower cream is absolutely decadent and makes you feel so clean yet moisurized, and the scent is so pretty! Layer it with the body lotion and you'll want to smell your skin all day!!",1
"I love the smell of this cream. The best part is that it works well on skin and your hair. It makes the skin soft and tames frizzies in the hair. The product is just the right consistency for both, not to heavy and not to lightweight. ",1
I love the smell of this line! I didn't notice any difference in the frizz factor and the curl cream really didn't work for me but I like the shampoo and conditioner. I only have to use a really small amount to coat my head and it rinses fairly well. It doesn't leave my hair weighed down. ,1
"I love the smell of this perfume. It smells exactly like soap and water and is so fresh and clean. I'd give it 5 stars, but the one problem I have with it is it does not last very long. I bought this small bottle to carry with me for touch-ups. I have a bigger bottle I use at home and I also use it with the body wash and body cream. The layering helps hold the scent, but even with all that, it really is a very, very light scent -- which could be great for someone who does not like a heavy perfume.",2
I love the smell of this product. It's not to strong and has a “You can wear everyday type smell”. It's very mild and does not stand out to the point where when you are at work you get those ones that have allergies and complain all day about your perfume. It's almost to the point wear my daughter can wear it to school and they wont notice she has on perfume. It kinda makes me think of like a bubble gum smell. I like it though. :o),1
"I love the smell of this shower gel. I starting out buying this, the lotion, and the fragrance for my mom (she is totally anti-fragrance, but Amazing Grace is the one fragrance she can wear, and she loves it!) but I fell in love with it myself. It is so clean and fresh...the fragrance just makes you feel good! My boyfriend loves the smell of this too! Also, the shower gel is very moisturizing and never leaves your skin dry...lathers nice too (I actually shave my legs with it!).",1
I love the smokey kit by TOO FACED. All the colors are so playful and you don't have to use them just for a smokey look. I also got each of the looks down pact since I had the cards to help me out. The only thing I do not like about this set is that the eye shadow flakes. Overall I think it is GREAT. ,0
i love the staying power of this mascara. it doesn't smudge or come off easily. the onlt thing i didnt like about it was the size of the brush. i thought it was kind of big making it hard to appy without messing up. ,0
"I love the Tarte full size cheek stains, but I never seem to use them up -- and I'm a person with sensitive skin who throws out makeup every six months to a year to make sure what I'm using doesn't contribute to my sensitivity. The mini cheek stain sets are my favorite, because I get that same natural look -- creamy, sheer, glowing -- and I get more colors than the full size. ",3
"I love the texture and the density of the color. My lips didn't dry out after using this product. The color is a bit pink for my everyday use, but I think it will work beautifully for when I wear pinker tones in general. Plus, I like having a pretty color like this in my 'kit'. ",3
"I love the texture of this product. I love how my face feel's soft to the touch, but is not left feeling dry like some powder's can leave your skin feeling. I also noticed that it provide's me with longer lasting coverage. It seems to grab hold of the foundation and keep me looking beautiful longer.\nThanks Smashbox!!",1
"I love the variety of colors in this little palette. Very easy to tuck in a purse. I'm fair with red hair/green eyes and they work for me. Not too shimmery or glittery, either (not good when hitting 50!) I can go as sheer as I want or build the color. The eye spackle is great to have with it, as well. I would definitely recommend this. Good price, good product. ",3
I love the way my face feels and my pores are getting smaller! My face did break out but I know that is because it is all the gunk coming to the surface. Don't start using this just before a big event give it a good month or so because it cleanses your skin and brings out all the impurities. GIVE IT TIME AND YOU WILL LOVE IT. ,4
"I love the way this makes my lashes look! Don't be put off by the big brush - it's perfectly usable and creates a ton of volume. Try it with the BADgal pencil (the original BADgal), for a sexy smoky eye!",0
"I love the way this makes my very oily skin feel. After washing with this I actually feel as if all of the oil has been removed from my face. It's a great feeling. I alternate it with Philosophy's Microdelivery exfoliating wash, and hope in a bottle and another acne product as needed. ",2
I love the way this stuff feels on my skin. However I found something mentioned in a recent review to be true with my order. The perfume is very faint.\n\nI fell in love with a small sample bottle. But I was forwarned by reviews about this very thing. That the smaller quantities smell lovely. But the larger bottles are woefully lacking. I expected more fromm this brand.,3
"I love the whole philosophy line, but Amazing Grace is my signature scent. This moisturizer is really softens my dry skin, with just a touch of scent. I get headaches from strong smells, and this definitely does not have a bad affect on me!",0
I LOVE this anti-oxidant supplement. I just feel healthier when I take it regularly and my skin looks better. Tastes great when added to cranberry juice. Dr. Brandt probably would not approve but it also is yummy when you add a dropper to a glass of champagne :-) ,3
"I love this! At first I thought it would make my wrinkles stand out and look dry. That was not the case. It gives a beautiful airbrushed effect and actually minimizes fine lines. Even my 80 yr. old mother commented how ""lovely"" my skin looked and I'm 56.",4
"I love this balm. Goes on tingly and kinda warms the lips. Lips are moist. This is kind of kiss and waterproof, last longish. This color is great for my lips. Looks natural and blends in with my own. Goes with many colors, easy to wear day into night! (Cocoa My Coconut) ",2
"I love this balm! I have the grapefruit, watermelon and chocolate bunny ones. I am a lip gloss girl and these are great because they provide a nice shine, a hint of color, smell great and are NOT sticky!! ",2
"I love this because i finally started to wear makeup again and needed something to remove it without dryin my skin this is great. This product goes a long way, it has thick creamy texture and it will not leave your skin dry.",0
"I LOVE THIS BLUSH,...A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY AND IT STAYS ON FOR A LONG TIME,.. BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT IT TO STAY ALL DAY PUT ON A LITTLE BIT OF A CREAM BLUSH AND THEN THE POWDER AND IT STAYS ON UNTIL YOU TAKE IT OFF!!",3
"I LOVE this blush. I first tried it about 4 yrs. ago at a Sephora store because I had read so much about how it had superior pigments, etc. It certainly lives up to all the acclaim! Well worth the price, especially when you consider that the pigments are so strong a little goes a long way. Easy to apply, just give you cheeks a SOFT initial application. Build up as needed. This is not your average blush so don't be too heavy handed.",2
"I love this blush, I have been using for the past year after I seen it was voted best of Sephora. It reallly is a quality line with beautiful colors. Highly Recommended if you don't mind spending a little more",1
I love this blush! I use Org@sm it is so flattering on so many people. When I don't have anytime to do my make up I brush this blush on and a coat of mascara and I look great! Really makes you look so glowy and healthy. And lasts forever I have had mine for about 3 years and there is a good size hole at the bottom but still tons of use left. I will be using this blush all my life.,0
I love this blush! I use Sertao to highlight my cheekbones (runway model look) and then i dab Gilda on the apples of my cheeks and it gives me natural looking rosy cheeks with cheekbones. it looks great!,0
"I love this blush. I was a bit skeptical about it being a shade for every skin type, I usually use more of a bronze color, however this blush looks great. It is light, but long lasting and gives the perfect amount of pink. Like you've been playing outside on a brisk day...or maybe, as the name suggests, rolling around between the sheets!!",1
"I love this blush - My favorite shade is apparently profanity by these posting standards, along with probably everyone else.\nIt lasts forever so it's worth the $25! Makes a big difference in your look but a subtle one.",1
"I love this body wash. Got in in the Tropical Jasmine and love the subtle scent with jasmine, coconut, vanilla, white amber and sandalwood. It's pleasantly floral, but with the hints of the amber and sandalwood and the spice-food scents, so it's not overwhelming in any one way. Plus the bottles are so sleek and elegant looking and the body wash foams up wonderfully. ",2
"I love this body wash. I am only half way done with the first bottle, but my body breakouts have almost disappeared! I still have some that pop up now and again, but they go away quickly and every week less come up. I gave it four stars because, even though it lasts a while, $40 for a body wash is ridiculous. It is, how ever, worth every penny so go for it.",0
"I LOVE this brand of CK gloss!!! It's a better value to buy the full-size, but those have so much product in them that they get a little icky after a while. Anyway, GREAT gloss, moisturizing, long lasting, and the shimmer is not offensive at all. And they all smell delicious!!! ",0
"I love this brow powder. I used to use a pencil but found that it pulled out my eyebrow hairs and my brows were becoming sparse. This powder glides on with the special angled brush without pulling on brow hairs. The duo colors allow blending to match different makeup palates. This powder lasts all day even in the hot weather. It may be a little more expensive than pencils, but I have used it evey day and have barely made a dent in it. And, because it doesn't need sharpening, it is not wasted.",3
"I love this brush! Although designed for smudging, it is versatile & can be used for blending, applying shadow in the crease, under the brow and lower lashes. The control you have is great so I have several. The only problem is that when they send them in a soft package they break, but the local store will exchange them. Sephora is the best, ",4
"I love this brush. I had the Flawless Application Brush before this, and it broke, so I decided to switch and I am SO happy I did! I found the Flawless brush to be too rough on my sometimes sensitive skin....this brush, however, is so soft! It feels wonderful! ",0
"I love this brush! I have two in case I misplace one. Until now, I didn't think about the bristles being scratchy, but maybe it has to do with how often I clean it. I use this brush for foundation application. I need special coverage, and on my cheeks, it's perfect. Of course, I am certain I use more foundation in each application, but I would not use anything else. Good with Mineral Veil also.",4
I love this brush. It gives me full coverage all over and I can guide it however I want. With the angled tip I can put just the right amount of shadow on the edges and my crease area. Ever since I started doing my eyeshadow with this brush I always get compliments on my eyes. I love it and I can't be without it. ,0
"I love this cleanser because it cleans very thoroughly, yet leaves your skin feeling soft. I still have to use a good moisturizer because my skin is very very dry, but I have tried many cleansers and Purity does the best job for the buck.",4
"I love this cleanser ! I have used the ""other"" brands, and I always come back to Sephora's whole face line. My skin is changing due to my age and I never have over - dry with this product. I will never use any thing else ! ",3
"I love this cleanser! It's my favorite ever. It's perfect for my combination skin, and great for removing eye-makeup (better than any eye-makeup remover I've ever used, in fact). If you don't like the scent of lavender, you will probably not like this product.",1
"I love this collection of color, because these tubes are bold and sexy and are easy to tote around. The minitubes come in fantastic colors and are perfect for keeping your lips moist and giving you lots of great shine and color. ",1
I love this collection. The smell is sensational but not overpowering. The body butter is wonderful for dry skin this time of year. I know of no one who doesn't have dry skin! I recommend this to everyone who talks about it! Indulge & enjoy! ,3
"I LOVE this cologne. My boyfriend has tried it a few times in the department store (hint, hint) so I bought it for him for our anniversary. I LOVE this cologne, it smells so wonderful. All I want to do when he wears this is smell him... ",0
I love this comb...i normally wouldn't write a review about a comb...but i really like this comb...it's wide tooth spacing is perfect for after conditioner in the shower!! and when it drops...it doesnt break...just happend to find that out... ,2
I love this comb. It is a must-have. I have two. One I keep in the shower when so that when I am done shampooing I can comb out my wet hair to prep it for conditioning. The other Sephora wide tooth comb I have I keep with my hair dryer and I use it to comb out my hair when I am about to start styling. The price is a steel & the comb will last you forever. ,2
"I LOVE this compact. I even refill it. It is a great chance to try the products. I absolutely love the lemon-aide, ooh-la-lift and boing. The Lip plump is good but a little opaque, but it makes the lip color go on true. The boing is for med. skin and I am very fair, but I put the lemon under it and it was fine. The OOh-la-lift is GREAT, it brightens the eye area and gives a younger look.I am slowly getting full sz.'s so I can always refill it. This is a great! I LOVE the highbeam for accenting cheekbones and more. One of my favorite compacts! Benefit is a terrific line! ",4
"I love this cream. It isn't greasy, it has a sophisticated but subtle scent, and it is slightly tinted to help make hands look their best. The benefit is completely noticeable after only one application.",2
I love this creme! I've tried several but this is the first time I saw results in just a few days. Tiny lines were gone. My eyes look younger. I received a sample through Sephora and I was hooked after a couple of uses. I ordered a jar as soon as the sample ran out! ,3
"I love this extractor!! Everytime I got a facial I wondered what tool they were using. It's really great at getting those blackheads on the corners of the nose. But as previously suggested, steam the face prior to using for the best results.",1
I love this eye cream. I am in my late forties with very oily skin and have trouble finding creams that don't cause breakouts. This works beautifully. It moisturizes without causing breakouts. I highly recommend it. ,3
"I love this eye cream! It instantly softens the skin around my eyes and makes it look dewy fresh, lasts all day and impoves the texture of under eye skin with continued use. I will stick with this product! No need to try more. ",3
"I love this eyelash curler! It does wonders for my short lashes. I can get into the little corners and they are finally brought out! it never leaves those unwanted weird curls, they're always perfectly curved. Never have I ever owned such a wonderful curler. I have to admit at first it was difficult because it didn't fit my eye as well as I hoped, but now - I'm in love! ",0
"I love this eyeliner, especially in Stash, which matches the outer rim of my iris. As others have said, it really glides on, and then stays put. EXCEPT for oily skin, which it smears on. But I can't imagine anything that wouldn't smear on my skin eventually. I challenge UD to come up with a liner that doesn't smudge on oily skin!",3
I LOVE THIS EYELINER!!! It's literally the best one I have ever used. It lasts all day and night (if you want). I've only used Zero because I love black but it's just excellent. It's glides on smoothly and just like it says very creamy. Definitely recommended!,0
"I love this eyeshadow and the variety of colors gives you some real bang for your buck. The brighter play colors can be a little overwhelming if you're used to softer pallettes. Tip: try one of the ""day"" colors, like the soft champaigne shimmer, and make your eyes pop by using one of the brighter ""play"" colors as a soft eyeliner. ",1
"I LOVE this eye shadow Palette! The color is amazing and the fact that the placement of each is imprinted on the shadow makes it a breeze to use! As a beauty blogger, I recommend this product to my readers who are looking for a wonderful, everyday shadow that brings out the best in all eye colors! Every woman should have this compact in her makeup bag!! ",2
"I love this eyeshadow! Perfect for everyday and when you want to vamp it up a bit. Contains the right amount of sparkle but not chunks of glitter on your eye. You can control the intensity wether you want it subtle or loud. If you prefer loud, mix with the eyeshadow transformer and you'll be on your way. I would still wear an eyeshadow base if you're in more hotter/ humid weather because it has creased on me before. ",0
"I love this foundation because it really does deliver the ""soft-matte"" finish it promises, preventing my face from getting too shiny and also hiding redness. I think my complexion really has improved since I started using this. ",1
"I love this foundation. I need to use very little to get very good coverage that lasts all day. It has a dewey finish but doesn't transfer when I touch it. My only complaint is the container - if I squeeze too much product out, there's no way to replace the unused portion. ",4
"I love this foundation! I was paranoid about ordering from the site, but the description was great and the shade matches perfectly! It does not slide off of my face half way through the day and covers all of my imprefections wonderfully! ",1
"I love this fragrance, but I prefer it more in the fall and winter. It can be a bit strong for summer humidity. It really smells like liquid candy in a bottle. It lasts for a l-o-n-g time and only takes a little bit for the full effect. I've noticed that the scent will change over time, it seems to ""deepen"" but is still very yummy. Will continue to buy till it is discontinued.",2
"I love this fragrance! I first started wearing this scent about a year ago, I have tried other scents after but I always come back to this one. I get so many compliments when I wear this. It's not too over powering, its not too subtle. Its perfect. It has a youthful,fresh smell that is great on everyone as far as I'm concerned! ",0
"I Love this fragrance, it is without a doubt the most beautiful fragrance I have ever smelled. It's soft and sweet. Unfortunately I would lable this a summer fragrance, which is unfortunate, because I would want to wear it all the time. The staying power of this fragrance is not as good in the winter months as it is in the summer. I love it and would purchase it many times over. ",3
"I love this fragrance. I was hesitant when I first put it on because I felt like I smelled like Cotton Candy or a kid. However, I get SO MANY Compliments its ridiculous. Much more than I ever did with anything else I've bought. It has great lasting power throughout the day too.",0
"I love this gentle face wash. Purity cleanses my whole face without stripping it and I can even use it over my eyes to take off traces of mascara. It's the only face wash I use and I never break out, I'm hooked.",0
"I love this hand cream. It's incredibly rich, but doesn't leave your skin feeling oily or greasy- it all sinks in and does a great job of moisturizing. I use it every night for my hands in the winter. ",1
"I love this - i have 2 in different colors. The colors are gorgeous and natural looking, the plumping gloss, is smooth, not sticky and totally fills out the lips so there are no lines. the color doesn't bleed and lasts all day long. . i have reccommended this to two friends, and they both love it too. ",1
I love this instant foaming cleanser. It’s a great wash and refresher and its a make-up remover. After washing my face with it I totally feel clean and refreshed. And it lasts a good while because it is foam.,1
"I love this. It helps to freshen up my face towards the end of the day or after being in the heat or in the sun. I wish I had purchased the travel size trio though, so that I could conveniently store it in my purse for use during the day.",0
"i love this it is all i wear most of the time but i love that it last all day and night others can smell it when you can't and it leaves a sent in the room or when you pass by someone that is so sexy,mysteriousjust the right touch of everything its PERFECT! I will buy it as long as they make it then even after that i'd look for a place that sales discontinued items but i hope that never happens",2
I love this! It really works! My face looks airbrushed when I use this. You really dont have to even use a foundation when you use this product. I though it would be heavy but its weightless and feels oilfree. One of my faves!,1
"I love this kit! All I wanna know is where was this kit & tutorial when I needed it in the 1980s! It really rocks my eyes, & am never short on compliments when I do my eyes up ""rocker style."" the tutorial let's you apply like a pro make-up artist! ",2
"I love this kit. My friend gave this to me yesterday as a Christmas present and i think it's amazing! The primer isn't my favorite but it works well. The tinted moisturizer works wonders. Granted that it is merely a tinted moisturizer, you won't get the same coverage as you would with a foundation. It's just enough coverage for me though. I don't find the egg shape sponge very useful for application but the velour puff on the other hand is quite handy. The camouflage/concealer work terrific together to hide under eye problems and blemishes. Also The brushes that come along with the kit are great very useful. The most important part of the whole kit is the setting powder that just pulls the whole look together. Without it you wouldn't have that flawless finish. The instructions are great and overall, it's a great value. So I suggest you nab one to sample this brand before they run out! ",0
"I love this kit, you get to try out a few of their face products and brushes. It's awesome! I love when Bare Escentuals comes out with new kits, it's a chance for us to try a lot of their products without having to spend a ton of money. I would definitely recommend this kit! ",0
"I love this line - finally a TRULY healthy shampoo without PETROchemicals, sulphates, etc. Even better, it delivers with results. For those who aren't accustomed to nautral products: This shampoo needs to be shaken prior to using get it to foam up. This shampoo will move around a bit differently than you may be used to. I love it! ",1
"I love this line! For the first time nothing has upset my usually sensitive skin and this travel pack has all of the products in airplane-approved sizes and they really last a long time. This is also a great introduction to this line because it can be pricey, but so worth it! ",4
I love this line of eye pencils. They are easy to apply and stay on all day. I wear the pearly brown which has a touch of gold. It is waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover. I prefer pencils I can sharpen and this doesn't pull or tug on the eye during application. I am very pleased with this product. ,4
"I Love this line of scents. I love to smell like true vanilla not some Funky cheap version. Plus when I was dropping my daughter off at school one morning I overhead one of her school mates tell another that Bella's mommy always smells good like candy. It made me laugh,, Kids are the best & honest!! :) ",2
"I love this liner! I have tried liquid liners before for ages with mixed results; the only one that stays on all day is the Laura Mercier cake one but some days I just don't have time to fuss with mixing it. I reached my 100 pts and was offered a choice of products to try, I jumped at the trial of this liner. I love the color, it's a deep purple, almost metallic but at 56 years old, I don't want to look like a 7th grader and this doesn't. At the end of the day, 9 hours after my make up was put on, when all is taken off at night, the liner is still on. This color was not available in my Sephora store but I was able to get it online. One of the things that makes this so great is the brush-very very easy to get a consistent line, top and bottom both sides, either thick or very thin. ",4
"I love this lip brush , my lipstick goes on smoothly and I am able to put the color where I want it, the brush is soft to my lips. I also love the fact that the bruch is retractable and that means no mess! that was my main reason for buying this lip brush. ",3
"I love this lip gloss! It has a perfect tint with many color options. Buxom makes my lips feel tingly and full. It does not last all day, but I do love an excuse to reapply because it makes my lips feel so good.",1
"I love this lipstick because it's a two-in-one in that it's both a lip pencil and a lipstick, so it's suuuper precise- which is vital for red lipstick because who wants to color outside of the lines(when it comes to lips)?\nI have this in cruella and it's purrrfect and sexy and dangerous- just the way I like it. It doesn't dry out my lips whatsoever. I put it on, and it lasts allll day long, given a few touch-ups here and there.\nI put on the rosebud salve a few minutes before I apply the lipstick, wait a bit, and wipe it off, so that my lips are soft and the thing glides right on. Perfect.",0
"I love this lipstick! I purchased the ""No Competition"" shade, which is possibly the best shade for me I have ever found. I ordered three more and some for my BFF. It wears long, goes on smoothly with clean edges and doesn't bleed. What more can I ask for? ",4
"I love this lipstick. I tried Cupcake and Totally Nude. Both are beautiful, smooth, creamy, and moist. The lipstick case is pretty also. I have to buy more and I normally perfer to wear just gloss and liner. A must have. ",2
"I love this liquid foundation on my skin. It goes on smooth and silky. It literally feels like I have nothing on, but when I look in the mirror my skin has a natural dewy glow. I use Look 5 and I don't have to use power with this. It lasted all day. Even after washing my hair I did not have steaks on my face showing where the water ran down. Also perfect color for me(I have yellow undertones.) I ordered 3 more at this price....... Get it while you can.... ",2
"I love this lotion. it has this wonderful fragrence to it, i can put this on without having to wear perfume or body spray. it comes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. never greasy, not thick. dont know about the firming part. im 20 years old so my skins pretty firm anyway. but I like this lotion",0
I love this! Makes my lips feel great and keeps them moist and soft. My only complaint is that colors keep changing and I really liked the nude or brownish shade which has been discontinued apparently.,4
i love this makeup it is so easy to use and your can use in different areas of your face eyes cheeks and face. it is not heavy or it doesn't fell like you have make up on. and it is healthy on your face. ,4
"I love this makeup. This is the best bargain on the best makeup that is on the market. I will never go back to liquid or cream makeup. This is so creamy. I have sort of dry skin and have to moisturize a lot. But, this stuff is so creamy and wonderful. It it seems too dry, then you didn't moisturize enough before putting it on. Go ahead, try the best makeup out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",4
"I love this Mascara, all mascara's i've tried before have never given me this full of lashes. I only wish it came in Waterproof. The ""Big Fatty Mascara"" is called that, because the brush is just that, Big, and Fatty. And the brush is tapered enough at the end to gets the smaller lashes. As other people have said, its not the longest wearing Mascara, and it has flaked occasionally. ",0
"I love this mascara and wish that it would be back in stock because I need more. First I use the Guerlain primer, then this mascara which I use a few coats. Once they are dry I continue on to Guerlain Maxi Lash for that extra plump and defining. All three together makes you look like you have the lashes that you have always wanted. But if you just want a simple look then I would only do one or two coats of this mascara and not add the Maxi Lash. ",1
I love this mascara because it really delivers on what it promises. It really lengthens my eyelashes and even thickens a bit without being clumpy. Clumpy has been my biggest problem with mascaras in the past. This has a really different looking brush--it's really cool. My only complaint is that this mascara doesn't come in brown. ,2
"I LOVE this mascara. Easy application, separates the lashes and lengthens. You can add more coats for desired fullness. So easy to remove...the tubes fall off as you wash your face. Note: It is not waterproof.",4
"I love this mascara!!!!!! I had tried with many others but seriously, this is the one that I love the best. It's light so it won't bring your curl down, your curliness can last all day long. It can creates very long lashes, and just apply it twice you will get really dramatic lashes! Doesn't smear or smudge. I am definitely getting another one soon!! Highly recommended!! ",0
"I LOVE this mascara. It goes on easily,does not clump and does not numerous applications to get the look I want. So it makes getting ready work, or getting ready to go much faster. Love the Plum color! ",3
I love this mascara! It is a little weird at first but after the first eye you get the hang of it. It gets every eye lash and the brush is kinda hard so you can get out any clumps. I think it reminds me of flake eyelashes but not obvious. This the best mascara I have ever used! ,1
"I love this mascara. It isn't as dramatic as some others, but it still does a great job at lengthening, volumizing and curling without clumping and being messy. Furthermore, unless you are an extreme smudger, you won't have to worry about panda eyes with this mascara - it does a great job at keeping clean, especially considering the fact that it is not waterproof.",0
"I love this mascara. It's great. I have been on the eternal lookout for a mascara that I am happy with and this is it. It seperates, lengthens, defines, and is long lasting. I am glad I tested it in the store. Don't ever discontinue this item. ",1
"i love this mascara, it's not ""dramatic"" but it's just the right thing for waking-up-late-need-to get-to-class-in-5-minutes kind of scenarios, and it immediately gives your eyes the spark you need. i also use it as a base and apply a second coat of mascara (usually Dior Show) for more dramatic effects :) ",0
I love this mascara! It will give you really beautiful hollywood lashes without the mess of glue and tweezers. It is an extremely lengthening mascara and promises to grab attention to your eyes. It has never run or bled with me and i have even worn it to work out.,0
"I love this moisturizer. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs into the skin within minutes. I has a mild, barely noticeable fragrance. I noticed definite improvement in my dry skin within two applications. This is a much better product for aging skin than the regular hope in a jar. ",4
"I love this moisturizer, the lightness and the 30SPF. I have break outs all over my face and neck though. This is the only new thing I have tried excpet for a shampoo that I stopped using weeks ago and I still breatking out so I think it is this moisturizer! Darn!",2
"I love this new mascara by Givenchy - You can paint your lashes in tiny sections, (brush off excess on the wand first) instead of going over the same area over and over as with usual brushes. It takes more time, but you'll have more control over the coverage. My only caveat is if you're the type who rubs your eyes, this is not the mascara for you - the formula is so rich that if you rub, your lashes will clump together, and you'll need to use an eyelash comb to separate them again. But use a comb anyway, if you're a real makeup maven! ",3
"I love this palette. Although it looks small, Snow Bunny & Sun Bunny are nicely sized (exact size of a MAC blush pan); Pink Leopard is a little bit smaller (a smidge larger than a Stila pan). Plus the flatbuki is sooo soft & great quality, just like the retractable kabuki. ",0
I love this palette and I'm buying the other 2 in a couple weeks. The colors are to die for and it blends very well...you really do only need a little bit and I use mine everyday. **If you find that the colors are too light a tick i do is to apply is backwards...sounds crazy lol...but yes if you use powder foundation and you're good at blending try it** ,1
"I love this palette it's great to work with bright colors and provides great color payoff. My faves are fishnet, honey and ransom but these colors are highly pigmented and they're worth the price.This set is also great because it has the primer. ",0
"I love this pencil. A couple days after I'd been using it, I went to get my eyebrows waxed and the woman said, ""you're so lucky to have naturally light brown eyebrows."" Fooled her! My brows are blonde and invisible without this baby. It's amazing. So natural too. I mean, if it fooled a women who's looking at brows up close ALL the time? Obviously it's an amazing product. Get it.",0
"I love this perfume, and I do not seem to be the only one that does. I have gotten many compliments from family and friends when wearing it. It has been the most comfortable I have felt with the perfume for a while since it blens so well with my body chemistry. :)",0
"I love this perfume. I usually can't stand samples that are given to me, but I actually enjoyed this one. I went and bought the full size bottle the next day. It smells very young, and kind of floral to me. It is not too overpowering at all. ",0
I LOVE this perfume nothing smells as good as Pink Sugar. It is not too strong or overpowering and it has a sophisticated sweet smell not cheap or juvenile smelling. I always have people wondering who smells so good? And what I am wearing? Great scent for all ages!,1
I love this perfume. The scent is sweet and almost like cotton candy. I received a bottle for my birthday and have been purchasing it for 4 years now. My husband loves it and my teenage daughter loves it also.,2
"I LOVE this perfume! Whenever I put it on it reminds me of my vacation to the carribean. It's long lasting and yet it's light enough to wear everyday. I call it a must have, plus the bottle doesn't break so it's great for travel. ",1
"I love this powder foundation. I ,too, had fallen for the Mineral type makeups only to fine that being in my late 40's it kind of just sat in the fine lines and wrinkles on my nose and forehead, so when I found this poweder foundation, I could not believe the results!! It give you great coverage, does not look heavy and dried out and corrects the discoloration in in skin. ",3
"I love this power. It's beautiful on your face and worth the price. I gave it 4 stars because I don't like the applicator sponge/system. If you put this powder on using the sponge applicator, after using it a bit the power can't get to the sponge unless you turn the power completely upside down and thump it a couple of time. When you do this, you lose control of how much gets to the sponge applicator. I prefer a method where I control the amount I apply. Other that that, this is GREAT STUFF. ",4
"I love this primer! It keeps my makeup from turning shiny or splotchy. I bought if for special occassions but I now consider it a basic. Also, I haven't had any problems with breakouts as one reveiwer did.",2
I love this product and have used for 5 years...I am 51 and my skin is getting dryer and I have stopped using at this time...if you have normal or oily skin this product is a must have. You feel realy fresh and clean.,3
"I love this product because it does what it says! Besides the high price, this product is perfect. It moisturizes my skin like no other (I got dry skin). The color blends in perfectly with my skin, unlike other tinted moisturizers that leave your face look orange. I am almost out of it and I will definitely buy it again. It beats every tinted moisturizer out there. For the extra shine blot your face with tissue or finish with translucent powder. ",0
I love this product because it strong enough to control my curly hair without being greasy like traditional straightening serums. I have also noticed that it really helps to control breaks and splits in the hair from repeated use of hot styling tools and blow drying. It also has a really light scent to it that smells great! ,0
I love this product combination from Cargo. It gives me a great summer blushing glow any time of the year. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. The blush and bronzer colors can be used on any skin color and it will look great on anyone. ,1
"I love this product! I always put it on on top of my moisturizer, before I put on my foundation. It leaves a smooth canvas for my foundation, (I use lorac breakthrough performance) and I find that it also makes my foundation feel smoother as well. One thing I found, which doesn't necessarily effect this new design with the pump, but does the screw top one, that if the lid isn't completely tight, it dries the product out, and it becomes rubbery and weird. Other than that, love the product! Definitely recommended!",0
"I love this product. I bought the blush in Orgasm. It goes on really nice and smooth, and gives off a nice subtle sparkle. The colour is great and completed my fair skin quite nicely. Over all this product was a beauty and will always remain a part of my collection.",0
I love this product. I first caught the smell from my older sister who is very into fashion. I bought one bottle from Sephora and received two more for my birthday from my sister and my best friend. It is Awesome and the people at work love the smell.,1
"I love this product, I have a toddler and for those who have children you know that polish and children do not go together. I can now polish my nails and add a few drying drops and in just a minute or so my polish is dry. ",2
"I love this product! I have been using it every day this summer. I haven't worn foundation and I don't have undereye circles so this was perfect under my eyes as a highlighter. I just put it on, threw on a little bronzer and I was good to go. Have used this product for quite some time now though more this summer and now I can't be without it!",3
"I love this product! I have been using it for 2 years now. Because it is oil free, I don't experience any breakouts and I am able to look fresh, as if I just applied makeup, all day. I also like that it doesn't rub off on my clothes or hands if I happen to touch my face. This product is perfect! ",0
I love this product. I have really thick hair and straighten it often which can be drying. My routine is to apply one application with my head flipped over and then again to the crown of my head. It never feels like I have product in my hair and since I only wash every other day-- this is a good thing! ,2
"I love this product. I have tried MANY products, but I just haven't found one that I thought really works. After only a couple days, my skin was far more radiant..which is hard to do in the low humidity levels of Colorado.",1
"I love this product. I have used this all summer, It is the best scrub i have found on the market. The coconut smell is fantastic and makes the entire shower smell like it cooconut when you use it. I have seen a drastic change in my skin from using it. It is smoother, and softer. I love all the phlilosopy products. ",3
"I love this product. I have very bad skin, including adult acne and rosacea, and this helps cover very well, and does not worsen my skin whatsoever. I've used this product for about 4 years, and plan to continue. It makes my skin feel fabulous...like silk.",1
"I love this product. I like that it can straiten and curl. It makes things so much easier for me and saved me some money. Instead of buying both a curling iron and a straightener this is was all i needed to get and it takes care of everything. It did take some time to get the hang of it when it came to curling my hair but once I figured it out I just loved it! I also love it's size, it is great to travel with. ",0
"I love this product. I live in Florida and my skin can get very oily. This cleanser cuts through the oil, dirt and make uo without over drying my skin. It is not harsh.\n\nDo not need an additional toner or make up remover. This does it all.\n\nAlso, I love the light refreshing scent.",2
"I love this product! I moisturize, then apply my foundation. Then I apply a small pea-sized amount over my entire face. It's fantastic! It really awakens your face and gently brightens it up. It also does not change the color of your makeup at all. I highly recommend this to anyone who feels their complexion needs a boost. ",3
"I love this product. I received a sample with my order and noticed smoother skin, smaller pores, and less lines right away. I am at the age when I am starting to get lines and this does help. I would advise people to use 1-2 times a week if you have sensative skin. :) ",2
"I love this product. it can be a bit tricky to use at first, but if you are patient and let the product set, it wears all day. I use them to line my upper lid right above my eyeliner, and line beneath my liner on the lower lid. if you use an artificial bristle brush, the application is really quite easy and gives you instant glamour. I like to coordinate the colors with the eyeshadow colors I've picked to wear that day. I've also worn this product all over my lids for an evening out, but found the next day that my eyelid was a bit puffy. a little eye cream calmed down my lids, but I think I'll stick to using them as an accent liner. used this way, this product wears remarkably long, and doesn't shed glitter or smudge. a must for anyone looking for a glamour boost to their look. when I add this item to my eyemakeup, I get tons of compliments; most come from very 'conservative' looking folks! ah, the power of glitter... ",2
"I love this product! It fits neatly in my make-up bag and is perfect for mid-day touch ups' Plus, it is refillable. I stopped in to my local sephora for an event, and the girls, who are always so helpful, showed me how to fill it ",2
"I love this product. It gives a beautiful luminous finish to my face. It glides on, doesn't streak ... and I love that it does not have harsh chemicals. I have been a seeker and user of organic products my entire adult life. I am so glad to have found Vincent Longo's Liquid Canvas Dew Foundation! ",4
"I love this product. It gives a dewy, natural sunkissed look. I'm pretty fair and I think its one of the closest products to my natural tan. Not for tanorexic types, although I suppose you could layer it on for stronger color. The highlighter is amazing... it gives glow not sparkle, I wear it even when I'm not wearing the bronzer. ",0
"I love this product! It is absolutely beautiful. Your skin just looks luminescent and healthy. Its especially great for special occasions and vacations. The price I think is excellent, you receive a lot of product and it comes with a retractable brush as well. I definitely recommend this product. ",0
"I love this product! It is just magical.I put it on and do not need foundation! It Imakes my pores and imperfections just disappear,like magic. I apply in the am and no need for touch up all day and I have combination skin. I have been asked if I have been on vacation or am I using a new skin care line,my skin looks so good.I usually just smile but then I share my new find,after all we women have to stick together. ",4
"I love this product! It is very economical. It is a great price for everything that is included. Not only does it have a good concelar for under eye (which I also use for blemishes on my face) but it has a great highligther that really makes a difference. It makes my face look brighter, and luminous. I also love the roller ball because it is very gentle for the delicate skin around my eye. ",0
"I love this product, it makes your lips feel so soft and smooth! I also like the way it kinds freshens your breath too. I recently got back from vacation in Jamaica and my lips got a little sunburned, so this product really comes in handy. I love Philosophy products and this is one I will always make sure I have! ",1
I love this product!! It really does produce flawless skin. I wear it under a tinted moistureizer and I'm good to go. The best part is I'm very oily and with this product I go almost all day without blotting.,2
"I love this product. It really works and I have tried a lot! It leaves my face flawless everytime. It doesn't burn and the primer really hold's the product on, it works like a concealer, primer, setting powder and foundation. This is a wonderful product, please don't change it! ",2
I love this product! It's great for everyday use- a little bit goes a long way. I especially love using it on days when I am not feeling my best. My complexion just glows! I highly recommend this product- one bottle will last a long time.,1
I love this product! Its one of the best purchases Ive made at sephora in a long time!. The colors last all day and are really easy to blend. If you are thinking about buying it....you should! You'll be happy! ,0
"I love this product, it's true that you have a few things that are unnecessary but it's a set well worth it's price. It covers up flaws without looking the least bit cakey. I would recommend it to anyone. ",0
I love this product! It took off my makeup (and I wear full coverage foundation and powder) with only a few swipes. I tested it on my eyes and it was so gentle and non-irritating. Left my skin feeling clean and refreshed and it's so awesome that I didn't have to rinse. Wouldn't recommend for removing waterproof eye makeup though. Great price as well. ,0
"i love this product...it won't make my skin dry..after i washed my face with nude cleansing facial wash, my face feel soft and smooth..and also the scent of this soap..OMG! i love it! make my face feel fresh. ",0
I love this product! I've been on the search for the perfect mascara for years and I finally found it! Each one offers something different and they are all fantastic. It's great to have little samples of something different. ,0
"I love this product line, no matter what the scent! I give Philosophy products as gifts to all the lovely ladies in my life and they always love it! The messages on the bottles make it that much better to give to someone you love. This particular Grace scent is my favorite, although I enjoy all the others as well. Very pretty, girly, clean...wear it any time of day and you'll get lots of compliments. ",2
"I love this product! Philosophy makes a great cleanser, it is so gentle on sensitive skin. I have been using it for years and would not change. It removes all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very refreshed. Plus, it smells great a nice clean, light scent.",2
"I love this product so much! I get more compliments than you would believe on how great my eyebrows look. I use Clinique's Brow Shaper in Shaping Taupe and then the clean Anastasia gel and it looks beautiful. There are other brow gels out there, but this has an amazing brush and doesn't get too much of it on there...awesome stuff!",1
I love this product the redness solutions base because I have the skin problems of a redhead (from my mother) and I sometimes run extra pink on my cheeks and my nose. This product solves the problem and provides a good base for my foundation.,4
I love this product. The smell is amazing but not overpowering. A little goes a long way so be careful not to use too much - can make your hair look greasy if yoiu use a lot of it. I have very long hair and it smoothes and defines my hair. I originally tried this product as a free sample with one of my orders and have been hooked ever since. ,2
I love this sampler set. I treat myself to one every so I can sample new fragrances. When I find the one that I like to most I go to my Sephora store for my free bottle. What a great idea and a great deal! ,3
I love this scent and got asked a lot what am I wearing. If you like sweet food scents then this one is for you. Its a long lasting scent but not too overpowering. The scent resembles those cinnamon glazed almonds with a hint of vanilla.,1
"I love this scent. It is so sweet and girly. I've received so many compliments when wearing it. (I LOVE to pair it with Lavanila's Vanilla Coconut, the scents are so divine together... positively yummy. Or try it as a base with just a spritz of something spicy for a sophistocated take).",2
"I love this scent. It's a yummy mixture of caramel, vanilla and cotton candy.\n\nIt doesn't smell cloyingly sweet at all. It's girlie with a touch of feminine class. Whenever I smell this I get great memories as a kid.\n\nI've always gotten the standard ""what smells like cotton candy?!"" when I wear this. I wear it usually during the fall time & pretty much all day. It's light enough for day but sexy enough for evening.\n\nIf you like sweeter scents, I would deff. recommend this!",0
"I LOVE THIS SCENT!! It's not too heavy, but lasts a long time. The really amazing thing is that BOTH my grown daughters loved it, and we rarely like the same perfumes. I was also happy (and somewhat surprised) that the set was $15 cheaper than it was at Lord and Taylor. That's a big savings. Keep it up Sephora! ",4
"I love this scent! So do guys! It also goes a long way. I don't like the price, but who does like the price when it comes to this stuff. Ralph is so light and fresh. Not too overpowering. Great summer and spring scent I think. But I wear it all year round.",1
"I love this serum. I just switched from the Dior Capture and I am thrilled so far. It has all of the good ingredients that you need for healthy skin. I will update in another few weeks, but so far, so great. ",4
I love this serum. It feels good on my skin and I have had no allergic symptoms whatsoever. I ordered this because I use the PTR sun screen every day year round on my face and hands and love that product as well. I have been taking antihistamines for a cold and they have not dried out my skin. I think this is due to the VIZ1000 serum.,4
"I love this set. I have so much fun changing out a different mascara every day. I have already found 2 that I like better than my Dior, and will be buying the full sized versions when the smaller ones run out. ",2
I love this set. It is a great value and the colors work great for me. I am brunette with light skin. Pure radience is my other favortie radiance. I like ruby better than rose and it is more of a blush than an all over face color. The eye and lip colors are great too. Love Love ,4
I love this set! It's so cute! The bag is small but fits perfectly in my purse. The shadow colour is beautiful and univerally flattering. I love the glitter eyeliner for a little pizzaz. The mascara is great as well. ,0
"I love this set - it totally got me hooked on Pure Grace! Lovely clean and fresh scent. I get compliments all the time at work and while i am out. The soap lathers well and lasts a long time. The lotion has a very light shimmer to it - great for nights out - but I wear it all the time anyway. The perfume smells exactly like the lotion. Its the perfect layering set for anyone who wants a scent thats not too floral or too strong for work, school, and everyday use. ",2
"I love this shade of violet and I bought another one because I was using my first ordered one so much and I didn't want to be running out! I love the color and the way it glides onto my eyelids! Plus, it stays on forever! ",2
"I love this shadow box! The colors are amazing, even the brown shades. They are so pretty and they go on really smooth and blend really well. Plus it comes with a mini primer potion, which is the best eyeshadow primer ever. ",0
I love this shampoo and have been using it for years... it cleans my hair without stripping it... my scalp is on the drier side so I need something gentle... the scent is refreshing and mild... I pretty much only use this or the Fresh Rose & Milk shampoo. ,3
I love this shampoo and I never splurge on salon shampoos and conditioners. This leaves my hair soft but not oily and very shiny. It seems to minimize the amount of straightening that I need to do and it smells great! ,2
I love this shampoo. It smells wonderful and lather's well for me. I love the fact that it comes in 32 oz bottles (as I don't want to be ordering shampoo every month to month and a half). It has done my hair well in the winter along with the mask. By itself it's not hydrating enough (I use the glossing conditioner though) so with a mask once a week this is FABULOUS! ,0
"I LOVE this shea butter i use it on my lips every day. It's great for every season, but especially in the winter when my lips are craving the moisture, i keep it in my back pocket so that it warms up and gets soft a bit and it is easier to apply. It's also great for dry areas on your face and hands. This is a must have!!",0
"I love this smell! It is wonderful and very feminine. It does have a strong scent of vanilla so if you don't like that, then I wouldn't recommend it. But I love it and it makes me feel like a princess everytime I wear it! And this set is a great value. ",1
"I love this so much! I have huge pores that pours oil like a well, and this manages to minimize the oiliness drastically. It also looks like you are wearing liquid foundation when you, gives our skin a lovely glow. Goes on very smooth, is like a whipped cream, but very very light. Also I have read some other reviews, if you are breaking out from using this, you are likely not cleansing your face properly, or it's the wrong formula for you skin type. The one thing I would suggest is to add some kind of SPF protection.",0
i love this spray. it works great if you spray it over your face after your usual makeup routine. it really makes your face glow and look radiant. ir also works in the middle of the day when you dont want to freshen up your makeup. my face feels dull without it! has a nice minty smell too although i dont really smell the grape...,0
I love this stuff...covers blemishes good and i don't have to put concealer on with it..goes on light and doesn't look like im wearing makeup..only thing is it is a little expensive...only wear it for special occasions!!,0
"I love this stuff-- every afternoon when I am feeling worn out and my t-zone is a shiny oil slick, a couple sprays do the trick. The scent is intense but does not linger- it's not perfumey but herbal in the best possible way. Not sweet or medicinal-- maybe it's the myrrh. Total pick you up for late afternoon.",2
"i love this stuff. for everyday, i use a drugstore brand of mascara, but for going out, this is tops. it's even better than diorshow, which flakes too much. the brush is bigger than any i've ever seen and your lashes just go va-va-voom! one caveat, though, it does smudge, so i don't recommend wearing it on bottom lashes.",0
I love this stuff. Get it with the coconut frosting body wash and you will be a coconut goddess! This stuff smells soooooo good and feels even better on the skin. It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin silky soft. Love it! ,1
"I love this stuff! I discovered this product about a yr ago after many attempts to find a new foundation. I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts, and this is great, it dosent clog ur pores and its so light, but the best part is that u get med. to full coverage, and its so easy to apply! It takes only seconds, and its fool proof, even a child can do this. It has SPF and it evens out ur skin tone incredebly! I use the foundation brush to belend it in, but the sponge alone is enough! ",1
"I love this stuff! I don't use it everyday, as it leaves my lashes stiff and will clump them if I'm not careful (therefore not 5 stars). But, for a night out it is perfect! I use it on top of my regular mascara and it leaves my lashes glossy looking and sparkling, I get comments every time. It really brings my eyes to life! ",0
"I love this stuff. I have it in black and use it almost every day. I had been using drugstore brand mascara before, and I'll never go back. This stuff goes on smoothly, doesn't clump and looks beautiful and natural. Amazing!",0
"I love this stuff. I have really struggled with my skin, but found the answer with this mask. I use a gentle cleanser (Purity Made Simple) daily, and this deep cleaning but still gentle mask once or twice a week. It cleans my big pores of all the dead skin without drying/stressing my temperamental skin. Since I started this regimen, I've been able to totally avoid the big, red, deep pimples that made me really self conscious even though they were occasional (hormonal breakouts, I think). I have never had a problem with uneven dispensing of the two different colors, but I was told it didn't matter if they came out in different quantities. Not an issue for me. ",1
"I love this stuff! I keep tins of this everywhere, in my purse, car, work and around the house. I use it for chapped lips, papercuts, hangnails and cuticles as well as dry skin areas. Stock up for winter!",1
"I love this stuff. I put it near the tear ducts to brighten my face. You can also put it under your eyebrows and use it as a highlighter, or you can use it as an eyeshadow. It's so pretty! I wouldn't use it on my cheeks though because it makes mine look muddy. It isn't very long lasting, either, but I think it is a good buy. ",0
I love this stuff..it covers all my blemishes and actually helps heal them! Whenever I use this to cover one I swear by the end of the day when I was my face the zit is dried up and gone! Its good for your skin and works wonders! ,0
I love this stuff! It goes on very smoothly and does not bring out any cracks in my lips or imperfections. The color is very nice and you can use different glosses over top for different looks. I do wish they had some more colors though. I like it better than Benetint. ,2
I love this stuff. It goes on without clumping give just the right amount of color and it stays put! My brows are blond/clear and you can't see them but this is a good product. I've had cheaper brands but this just works better.,2
"I love this stuff. It is hard to explain exactly what it smells like, but I would describe it as definitely a floral scent with notes of baby powder. It is a very feminine fragrance--there is nothing unisex about it. The texture of the cream is perfect too. It is very hydrating, without being overly greasy and heavy. When I use this, I apply it after my shower and let it be my entire scent for the day. It is subtle, sweet, and not overpowering (which is nice, if you happen to work in close contact with a lot of people.) This cream is worth every penny. ",2
"I love this stuff! It's one step to makeup removal and cleansing at night, and it smells great, and has natural ingredients. It doesn't dry out my skin, which is really sensitive, and it cleans everything away...even waterproof mascara!",1
I love this stuff. It was suggested by one of the consultants at Sephora while I was making another purchase and it is now a staple. I use to freshen at times during the day and most especially after washing before bed as a toner. Spray it on and wipe with cotton ball. Leaves your face feeling fantastic.,2
I love this stuff! I use it all of the time and really feel that it helps moisturize my lashes so they don't dry out and break. It also lengthens them super long. I get so many compliments when I use this with the right mascara (I love definicils) about how long my lashes are. ,2
"i love this stuff. i use it and another ""glossing"" cream of fekkai's and mix them together. i have fine hair, but lots of it, and creams like this can tend to make my hair greasy by the end of the day. not this stuff. it is great! i'm purchasing both creams again and i don't usually do that with hair products -- i switch up trying to find one i like. this i like. buying again. ",2
I love this stuff. This is the best scrub I've used ever. Expensive yes but such a wonderful treat for yourself. It smells wonderful and it's a gentle moisturizing scrub. Perfect for the winter months when the skin is drier.,1
"I love this sunscreen. Infact, it is my new favorite and I have tried and own quite a few. It applies easily over any other product and is immediately ""dry"" to the touch. My skin is left feeling soft and comfortable, with nothing white left behind. ",4
"I love this sunscreen. I put it on under my foundation. It doesn't cause breakouts either!!!!\nBut don't put it on your lips, because if it gets in your mouth it tastes yucky...and it can be hard to get rid of the taste.",1
"I love this take on Kenzo's great Flower fragrance. It is a bit more delicate but well suited to chilly mornings. I work with the public and need to be concerned if people find what I'm wearing to be too strong or annoying. It hasn't happened with Winter Flowers, so I will continue to use it. ",4
I love this traveling case because it is a great organizer for all your cosmetics and is a great looking case. This case is lightweight enough to travel as well as a great cosmetics holder in your home. I love using this for all my favorite eyeshadows and blushes and it is a great way to always find the colors you need. ,1
"I Love this wonderful, light powdery rose scent, It is beautiful. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long, so where is the body lotion and shower gel?????? I would be nice to be able to layer this scent to make it last longer ",3
"I love this, wouldn't be with out it . I use it for under eye's and the side of my nose. On my chin , And then I put on my Bareminerals makeup powder over and TA Da my face is flawless and it lasts all day!!",4
"I love Totally Toasted! It is the perfect combination of colors for both day and night. I have tried Urban Decay eyeshadows as well, but nothing compares to Too Faced! It is very pigmented and shimmery, but the glitter never falls in your face. Perfect for any age, really makes your face glow. ",0
"I love to use this on the inside corner of my eyes (where it is darker) it immediately lightens it up-and adds an ""up-scaled"" effect to my eyes. Helps hide your age in your eyes I think. Be careful not to use too much for every day wear-could add more for evening. ",2
"I love trying all of these mascaras that I wouldn't have purchased otherwise. I have such a problem with mascara ""flaking and shadowing"" and this is a great way to test for that without spending a lot of money. So far I've loved a few and eliminated a few. ",4
"I love Urban Decay eyeshadows! I love the 'kid in a candy store' feeling I get when I approach their display. there are so many great choices and always new ones to try. the pigments are true and the sparkly/frosted shadows blend beautifully with matte colors. they last all day, as well. 'Midnight Cowboy Rides Again' is my go-to highlight shadow for any skin tone. they are so concentrated that they have lasted me, literally, for years. not only are these shadows lots of fun to 'play with,' they are high quality and look great on gals of any age. wish I could own them all! ",2
"I love Urban Decay's eyeshadow's and this pallet is wonderful. Great color choices good for day or evening wear and the colors are bright, beautiful and blend very easily. You definitely can't go wrong with this one! ",1
"I LOVE Urban Decay's eye shadow specifically because of the intensity and stay power of the colors. They are really beautiful and any woman can use them and look great. Sometimes I find that I apply too little makeup, but even with UD, the color shows beautifully. ",2
"I love Urban Decay shadows & the primer potion. This pallete is well worth the money, great color choices & it even includes a smaller primer potion, (this stuff is magic!) it keeps the shadows true to color & looking fresh all day. ",2
"I love using this primer because of the weightless feel and soft texture on my skin. It's quick and effortless to apply with my fingers, invisible, contains anti-aging properties as well as spf, last but not least, really helps foundation perform better. I usually use a loose powder or liquid foundation and this works fine with whatever foundation I'm in the mood for at the time. I'm very glad it comes in a ""to go"" size as well.The smaller size is all I need. ",3
"I love using this product! I have the photofinish light for oily skin and it really helps me out with the oily slicks on my skin. In the most humid days, I just have a slight dew on my face and not a bunch of oil like I usually have. I recommend this product to everyone who wants their makeup to last longer!",0
"I love Vincent Longo Lipstick, it goes on smoothly and it has great moisture and looks great. My only complaint with Longo lipsticks is they are so soft that they tend to break if you are not careful. ",4
"I love Vincent Longo Wet Diamond Eye shadows. They are very sparkly, and as I've discovered with sparkly eye shadows, using wet gives the most intense results. The lighter shades make nice highlighter, and used dry with a primer, also gives nice results. I got the Aquila, because I tend to like brighter, more intense shades, and that purple is over-the-top gorgeous! ",3
"I love what this product does for length and volume. But the fibers break off and get into my eyes! All the time there is mascara fibers in my eyes! Always, I am digging in my eyeball. Looks great but I think I'll be trying something new.",0
"I luuuurve this blush. I am super duper pale with freckles so what type of blush and how to apply it has always been a mystery to me. Well, no more! This blush is amazing, looks so natural, and is so easy to apply. I am happy that I can finally complete my look with this blush (ps I used the Deep Throat color).",1
"I'm 28, so perhapd this product is not for me, but I tried it and did not like the way it felt on my skin. It caused break-outs and had no effect on the aging of my skin. The portions are small and I barely made them last one month following the guidlines of the directions. If anything this product made my skin feel worse. ",1
I'm 37 years old. I knew smooth skin once...like 15 years ago when I didn't need foundation! To get that smooth look again (and use foundation) I use Photo FInish Foundation Primer. It seems a bit much on hot days though.,2
"I'm 48 and spent years in the Arizona sun, but you wouldn't know it by looking at me :) I've been using Cellex-C products for more than ten years and swear by them. The serums are relatively strong, so ease into use, but I recommend them highly. ",3
"I'm 49 and have been using this eye cream for about 3 years. I love it!! I've tried a lot of different brands in my life but this is the best. Never leaves your eyes puffy, like some brands. It is light weight and goes on easy. I would recommend this eye cream. ",3
"I'm 55 years old and my skin is losing elasticity. This product has remarkably improved skin texture, firmness and color. You use only about the size of a pea to cover your face, and it absorbs completely. It leaves my skin feeling soft, not sticky or too tight. I have tried a Kinerase lift product and was not as impressed. ",4
"I'm 56 and needed something for dark and somewhat wrinkled beneath the eye.\nThis worked Fantastic.. stayed all day and never caked into the wrinkles.. I was doubtful, but now i will always use litf concealer",4
I'm 61 and I don't usually believe such claims but I was desperate so I tried it. It makes a huge improvement in the appereance of the extra skin under the neck. From now on I was always have this product in my bag of tricks! ,4
"I'm 64 yrs. old & purchased this on advice fr. a friend. WOW-I've had trouble in past w/ makeup staying all day. Since I'm older it would fade and crease. I use a little of my regular makeup very sparingly as a base, then spray this over cheeks & chin line area & VIOLA-perfect skin all day! I'm amazed - it's worth every penny.",4
"I'm a big fan of Kevyn Aucion; as expected, this gloss has a lovely color and texture. However, it is difficult to twist the pen to expell just the right amount of gloss. Sometimes end up with a gooey mess on the pen. ",3
im a bliss fanatic - the spa and the products. got this mask as a sample at the spa and had to buy the full bottle. literally feels like youve just had a facial at home. super-softening and brightening. ,1
"I'm actually a little disappoined to see some negative reviews...I love this mascara! I definitely noticed that it made the whites of my eyes appear whiter (a definite plus, as my eyes always seem to have a red cast to it) and it made my lashes more voluminous. Also, the color it deposits isn't tacky blue, but a subtle blue that I (or others) noticed when I was in the light. Love it. Want to get it again. ",0
I'm addicted to coconut and really looked forward to receiving this and was very disappointed. It doesn't really smell like coconut. I guess you can tell there's coconut in it (if you try very hard). I won't be buying it again. ,4
"I'm addicted to the bronze shade. It lasts all day (and night) and looks great as a liner or over the whole lid. It's my go-to weekend makeup -- it's just enough to look ""done"" without any effort at all. One caution: I've found that the matte shades in this line don't go on as smoothly, but they're still good liners. ",2
"I'm a die-hard Bare Escentuals person, so when I saw this, I had to have it. I was a little disappointed by the small size of the individual pots (smaller than the regular shadows), which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, but the colors are beautiful and look just lovely when applied. They come in a plastic box that has suggestions for color combinations. I really look forward to trying them all. ",3
"I'm a fair skinned girl and was looking for the perfect blush for the winter, I have red hair so picking a shade for blush is difficult. The peachy pink of 'Amour' is perfect, no shimmer just a natural flush.\n\nIt's also long lasting i put it on in the am and even after napping on the couch it stays put.",0
"I'm a huge fan of Shiseido in general and have been happily using most of their Pureness skincare line for a couple of years, but this scrub was a rare dud. While it does provide a gentle exfoliating effect with a light, pleasant scent and rich texture, I didn't really notice any additional improvement to my pores versus not using it, and I never felt the promised warming effect in the slightest. It didn't do anything bad, but it also really didn't work any better than lots of drugstore scrubs that are half the price. I'm still using and loving the rest of the Pureness line, but I'll pass on repurchasing this particular item in the future. ",2
"I'm a huge fan of Shiseido's Pureness line, so I couldn't resist trying this one out when I first saw it. The cleaning agents in this seem to be pretty comparable to the solution on the Refreshing Cleansing Cloths -- watery and lightly scented, it effectively cleans off dirt and makeup without leaving your face feeling sticky, dry, or tight. I think the rinse-off cleaners may be a little better if you have a seriously oily face or need to clean up particularly heavy makeup or dirt from a smoggy environment, but this is still quite nice for a quick, lighter mid-day or before-bed cleanup. I'll probably stick to the Pureness Refreshing Cleansing Sheets when this runs out -- not that there's anything wrong with this product, I just find the extra one-step convenience of the sheets suits my needs for a wipe-off cleanser a little better. But if you're looking for a lightweight rinseless cleaner and aren't as worried about the product's portability, the Refreshing Cleansing Water is also an excellent choice! ",2
"I'm a huge fan of the Soy Face Cleanser, and have converted many of my sensitive skinned friends to this product. it's gentle, fully cleanses, and the scent is quite relaxing. I also loved every single product from the Fresh skincare line. Anyways, this gift set is the best value on sephora! Just do the math (based on available products): $15 soy face cleanser 1.7oz $14.12 umbrian clay treatment 1oz $42.50 mamaku night serum 0.5oz = $71.62, the value of the set PLUS you get a cute gift box, and product in smaller sizes so there's no commitment. The perfect gift to your best friend, or what the heck.. yourself~ ",1
"i'm also a BE addict and these glosses are great. the colors are very forgiving and texture is not goopy or sticky at all. it feels very light on my lips and it does create a fuller, more voluptuous lips.",1
"I'm always on the hunt for a mascara that thickens my puny lashes but doens't smudge or flake. This one does really well. There is some flaking by the end of the night, but, HALLELUJAH! no smudging. On the downside, it is expensive and you don't get much. No need to worry about throwing this out after 3 months - I've only been able to get 2 months worth out of the very skinny tube. ",3
"I'm always on the look out for mascaras that will give me volume and length without making me look like I have tarantula eyes. This mascara is one of the very best that I've tried. It separates each lash and fans them out to look super voluminous and it lengthens very well too! Also, I don't end out with black flecks on my cheeks at the end of the day like I get with other mascaras! I would totally reccommend this product!",0
"I'm a mascara addict. You name it I have it ( Lancome, Dior, Too Faced, Tarte,Smashbox,Benefit and Lash Fusion. I have very short lashes and I need volume. I have found my fix with this mascara. I apply @ 5am and it lasts all day. Oh, I workout every day as well. I don't have problems like the other users. ",3
"Im a mascara freak and am ALWAYS looking for fuller, thicker and longer lashes and I found this one to be amazing!! Its best for layering over a few coats of already dried mascara than putting on bare...It tends to clump a bit (because of the perfect big brush) if you use it alone.\nIf you like to layer mascaras like me, its perfect! If you like the natural one coat look, not for you. :)\nIt has a great color, a little flaky after 6 hours or so, but not too bad, and im from humidified Florida... haha! Hope that helped!",0
"I'm a ""mature"" woman whose lashes, sadly, are thinning, and this mascara is wonderful for adding volume without clumping. The texture is exactly right for volumizing--not too liquid and not too dry. It's the best I've found for my lashes, and believe me, I've tried many! ",4
"I'm an avid swimmer/water polo player so I'm constantly on the look for every kind of waterproof makeup. This is a must have of all my waterproof makeups because it seriously stays on through practices and games without smearing. Creamy, rich, pigmented, smudgeable, long-wear and easy to apply. To get this to stay, you have to make sure you apply as little as possible, because it's easy to over apply with such a silky pencil. The over applying is what causes smears. Great product! ",0
"I'm an Urban Decay freak, but this product in particular i use almost daily. It has a perfect combonation of colors that you can either use for a night or day look. As always, UD shadows are my favorite for blending. Plus, the extra sparkle is amazing :) Along with the Primer Potion (also amazing for keeping that shadow in place), its a duo you cant beat for $39! ",0
"I'm a picky user of eye products, especially liners. This one can do anything from a precise cat's eye to a smoky Eva Green look to a Captain Jack guyline. It's the only eyeliner I've found that can create a smoky eye in one step. ",1
I'm asian and this eyelash curler curves perfectly to fit my eyes. They never pinch and they curl perfectly. It really makes a difference when you change out the rubber strip after you've been using it for a while. ,0
"I'm a sucker for marketing, so I own this in orgasmm (I'm being censored by Sephora...) and deep throat. Not just for this, of course, but the colors are absolutely gorgeous. My skin is REALLY fair, and the colors aren't too dark to take over my face. I'm left with a natural, peachy glow.",0
"I'm a sugar scrub addict and this is one of the best. The combination of oils softens and moisturizes your skin all day. Nice large sugar granules exfoliates very well. It's nice to use on tanned skin. The scent is fantastic and lingers. I've been told I smell ""delicious"" after using this. Now THAT is a compliment!",3
"I'm a very fair skintone with pink undertones. I was looking for a medium shade of brown with more undertones of silver/grey than gold/yellow. I was so happy with this purchase! I use it in the crease and outer corners of my eyes for a beautiful, glamorous pinup look. I ALWAYS use Urban Decay Primer Potion as an eyeshadow primer, so I never have a crease problem with this shadow. ",0
"I may be one of only a handful of people in the world that didnt absolutely love this mascara; it was very inky black, which is good, but it clumped very easily and the tube dried out so fast that it definitely wasnt worth the money. ",0
"I'm beginning to run out of superlatives to use when describing Too Faced products. I'm a makeup junkie and increasingly I find it difficult to say ""no"" to Too Faced's wonderful little palllettes! I'm not good at mixing and matching colors. Left to my own devices, warm and cool end up on my face along with all the seasons, and I emerge looking like a blind clown. Thank goodness for Too Faced. It's easy to put on just the right amount, because the colors are so buildable without powderyness. In this kit are eight terrific eyeshadows which I've found very complementary to my pale skin. The shades work well in the three-color application technique as well as a daytime pale color plus deep shadow as liner approach. I continue to adore the glosses for their sheer color which isn't a bit cartoonish, and the blush is perfect for a healthy glow. The case is small but holds a lot of product. I've found also that the case is strong and stays shut while in my purse. That's important to me, as I carry enough stuff anyway. Except for the gloss, nothing ever needs reappllication, but I carry it around anyway. All this in one convenient package at an amazing price! I'm sure it is only a matter of time until everyone uses Too Faced exclusively. ",2
"I'm CONSTANTLY searching for a foundation that provides full coverage, looks great on me all day and doesn't make my skin break out. This foundation made my pores appear smaller, and my skin look amazing all day long. I really love it, EXCEPT...my skin does seem to break out. For this reason, I'm only going to use this foundation on special occasions when I want to look my best. If your skin isn't prone to breakouts, however, I""m sure you would love this product. ",1
"I'm currently having to take a break in my morning routine, because this product is just sitting on my skin; debating whether or not it will actually absorb. I don't have time for breaks in my morning routine. Beyond that; I find the product a bit confusing -- when I first applied it to my face, it looked more like a buff-shaded facial mask. It took a lot of working in for me to actually see my skin again.The tint doesn't provide any coverage; so I'll end up applying foundation on top of this slick and praying my face stays put. I'm not amused. ",1
"I'm definitely not a glitter person, but I love ""Dominique."" It's micro glitter is really micro, you wont be sparkling, but it gives your lips the right amount of shine. I can't find the right word to describe it! Also it has a nice vanilla scent, and makes your lips tingle a little bit.",0
"I'm doing Christmas shopping now and I'm buying several of these for my coffee loving friends. The smell is incredible. I love to do theme gifts. Wouldn't this make a cute gift with a coffee mug and/or a bag of coffee? Oh, and don't forget the coffee house set of lip glosses to go with as well. ",3
"I'm extremely pale and so I have a hard time finding foundation that matches my skintone and this one hit it right on the mark! E0 matched perfectly! The only thing I dislike is that it goes on cakey even though it is supposed to be sheer. I only had to use a dab for my whole entire face,so I'm guessing it will last a long time. Great for people looking for full coverage makeup and for those who have a hard time finding a shade of foundation that matches their skin. ",0
"I'm extremely picky about fragrance and this is the only thing I'll wear. It smells delicious like candy, but has notes that make it more sophisticated and not drugstorish. Great for younger girls. iIget compliments all the time!",0
I'm fifty and have dark circles under my eyes that are medium in color. I tried a sample of the Hylexin and just had to have the full product. It erased my circles instantly.I also use it on the bottom of my eyelids (dark purple there too) and it worked. I love it ,3
"I'm from Hawaii, and going to school in NY was a huge culture shock. My hands were so dry they would randomly bleed! I couldn't understand why at first, and when my roommate said it happens from the cold, I started searching for a thick lotion. I bought this one at Sephora thinking ""Snow Wonder"" meant it was for the winter dry hands. It's fabulously thick, and make me want to squeeze out the entire tube and just relish in it. I love the scent, I heard it's supposed to smell like just fallen snow, but I've never seen snow so I wouldn't know lol. I lovelovelove this hand cream, its saved my hands! ",0
"IMHO, nothing smells more refreshing in the summer than a grapefruit scent, and this is great. I don't know how many containers of this pink grapefruit-scented body butter I've gone through. I put it on it the morning, after a shower, and before I go to bed, especially on my feet. Please don't do away with this scent, Sephora! ",4
"I'm hooked on this lipstick. For a while I didn't put anything on my lips except maybe some tinted chap stick because I hate lipgloss (I'm over the high shine look and my hair gets stuck in it) and lipstick often looks too chalky for me. Not this one! I love wearing this lipstick because it actually makes my lips softer. It's not overly heavy or sticky and the color is perfect for a little more than a subtle hint of tint, which is exactly what I was looking for. I had bought a clear lipliner to wear with this, but I never use it because this does not bleed or feather without it. This color is great to use for either a look with heavy eye make-up or a day at the office so its very versatile.",1
"I'm in LOVE with Bettina. It's my perfect shade. The consistency and color are just beyond gorgeous. I'd give it five stars, but I die a little inside every time I sharpen it and see product go to waste. I've actually resorted to taking a lip brush to the shavings and applying it that way. THAT'S how good this color is.",1
"I'm naturally a ""dirty blonde"" with pretty dark eyebrows, but dark brown powder is still pretty obvious on me, so when this little guy came in a sample, I tried it for a couple days, loved it and had to get more...so I did and still love it!! Plus the powder stays on all day ......",1
"I'm never without this product--if I can help it. Now that I can buy it at Sephora, I never will be. It goes on so smoothly, a little goes a long way. Applicator is easy to use--does all it says it will and comes in more than one shade. Try it--you'll LOVE it!!",4
"I'm not a fragrance person because most give me a headache. However, I love the Philosphy Grace scents. Pure grace is very, very light, and it just smells like a ""clean"" scent. Inner Grace has just the right balance of fragrance for me. My sister has the same sensitivities to fragrances as well, and she loves it, too! The body lotion is very rich, and people will say you smell so good. I highly recommend Inner Grace if you like a milder fragrance! ",3
"I'm not going to lie, this is my first Dior splurge and I'm glad I bought it! The colors are beautiful and highly pigmented and how up wonderfully on your eyes. The 5 eyeshadows can all be worn alone or blended together for the perfect look. Long-wearing, highly pigmented, easy to apply, blendable. By far one of my favorite eyeshadow palettes out there. Not to mention the case in presentation of the whole thing is just delectable. Definitely try it out. ",0
"I'm not much of a foundation person but thats also because I have found a solution... Nars Bronzing Powder! Its light and yet tan color helps cover up some of my inperfections but also keeps a natural look. If I want to look a little more edgy, I just add some blush.",1
"I'm not sure about it's priming abilities. I have used ""traditional"" primers and this one feels nothing like them. There is no priming effect after applying, however, foundation does go on smoothly but I think that is because it's a great moisturizer. It won't smooth away lines like some other primers but it will leave your skin very soft and supple for makeup application. I find it to be an excellent light moisturizer and I have repurchased it several times to use in conjunction with Laura Mercier's Rich Perfecting Water. I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin and this has never made me break out. No funky smell either! But if you're looking for something that will mattify or fill in lines, this probably isn't what you're looking for.",1
"I'm not sure how this product does it- but it's magic. My pores are so much smaller, and my makeup has better coverage after applying this product first. I highly recommend it to those who use mineral makeup- it gives that extra boost of coverage.",1
I'm not sure how well this hydrates but I'd rather use this than a nail strengthener (which can make brittle nails even worse) and since using it I haven't broken a nail and my polish chips much more slowly. I've liked almost all the Sephora by OPI I've tried. ,4
I'm not sure if I'm applying wrong or not enough but it doesnt seem to really cover anything. I have good skin so it doesnt matter that much but I expected it to look better! Umm...I'm just not sure about it at all. ,0
"I'm not usually one for filling wrinkles- I'm about not getting them. But sometimes you just have to realize that time is marching across your face... this wrinkle filler is light weight, dries quickly and stays put- I feel like I've lost 5 years off my age when I use it. ",2
"I'm now into my second kit and I'm really seeing a change in my skin. My pores are smaller, my skin is softer, the small lines on my face are much less noticeable. It's a little pricey, but for what you get, it's really not bad and I think it would cost me a lot more to buy the parts separately. I only use this in the evenings because I don't like their SPF product. ",2
"I'm no young woman and I have several areas on my face that have clusters of spider veins. This concealer is perfect for covering those areas, plus any sun spots. I'd go without mascara before going without this item and that's a huge statement of satisfaction.",4
"i'm obsessed with this product. i carry one in my purse and keep one at home. i use it as a final touch on the darker corners of my face (sides of the nose, inside corners of my eyes.) it just lifts everything up in such a natural way and is not cakey at all. it's pricey, but lasts for a looong time.",1
"I moisturize my lips both day and night and use this product in the clear over other glosses, etc. It feels wonderful and I really do get a boost to my lip size. If you have great lips...by all means try this. I feel you can never have too large a lip......it adds to your entire look.",4
"I'm one of those people who seems to have chronically dry lips, so I was really excited to try this. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my potential and has been left at the bottom of my makeup drawer. The taste is awful (you can't help but get some in your mouth since it's on your lips), and it globs out rather than spreads over your lips. Not worth the price, though I am a die-hard Benefit Cosmetics fan. ",1
"I'm on my first jar and will probably repurchase. It is lightweight, not greasy, but hydrates really well. The only drawback is the jar design...it is VERY bottom heavy with no edges on the top to hold on to. I've dropped/almost dropped the jar every morning. Fortunately, since it's glass, it hasn't broken but it's just a matter of time.",4
"I'm on the fence about this product because I personally don't see that much of a difference when I put it on, but my several other people have complimented me when wearing it...so I guess it really does work! This product lasts a longtime, so you get your money's worth. I was a little irritated though because the lid broke the 2nd day i had it. ",0
I'm reviewing this product because I simply want other women to know what a remarkable find this product is. I'm 57 years old and I've finally found Smashbox Photo Finish. It's an incredible find. My foundation glides on like velvet or silk. Truly a hidden secret from women my age. I don't know where I've been but I feel lucky to have stumbled onto this product while searching the web. The best way I can describe the product is to tell you that if you have imperfections on your face this product will create a canvas that allows your makeup to glide on smoothly and give you the photo finish we all dream about. GREAT PRODUCT!,4
"I'm satisfied with my Clinique Acne Solutions spot healing gel. It doesn't really have a smell and helps banish zits and ugly spots fairly quickly. It can be a tidge drying and I don't think it's more exceptional then clean & clear spot treatments, but I think it works well. ",0
"I'm sixty-six years old and I have the skin of a fifty year old. This is the only nightime moisturizer I use, and I use it over When Hope Is Not Enough Serum. It is gentle, emollient, and doesn't stain the pillow. I wake up dewy and young-looking, and I love it. I won't use anything else. ",4
"I'm so glad Sephora is now carrying YSL. this gloss is one of my favorites of their line. it gives your lips a delicious shine and wears very well for gloss. the colors are simply gorgeous. and a tube will last you a long time. try it for extra sparkle on an evening out. the glitter is sheer and sophisticated, suitable for anyone who wants a bit of sparkle. very nice stuff. ",2
"I'm so in love now with Anastasia! This product will set your brows in a perfect arch and not move. I chose the clear, because I didn't wan tto add color just keep them in place. I don't feel as if I have sprayed them with aqua net. It comes off gently with cleanser or a make-up removing cloth.",1
"i'M SO IN LOVE WITH THIS SCENT. iTS SOMETHING i'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR , FOR AWHILE. iTS THE PERFECT BALANCE OF SOAPY,POWDERY AND ALITTLE MUSK. iTS SO FRESH AND LIGHT BUT SOMEHOW ALITTLE SEXY. VERY CLEAN AND PRETTY!!! ",2
"I'm sorry but I hate this mascara. I put it on and it looked like I didn't have on any mascara. It does not lengthen and it barely darkens. I took it off and used something else. So it's easy to wash off, I'll give it that. ",0
"I'm still trying to learn why everybody is raving about this powder. It is a good product but to me, no better than any other good quality loose powder. Also, it is hard to use without wasting a lot of it because it flies through the air! Am I missing something? ",3
I'm sure that I've tried them all and this is definately the best! It stays in place all day until you remove it yet it is not difficult to remove like some of the other mascaras of this type. You can build several layers to get the thick long look you want but one layer is plenty. I wear contacts and have many allergies and this mascara does not cause any problems for me. I need to make sure that I never run out of it! LOVE IT! ,4
I'm torn on this one because it has managed to keep my lips from being chapped at all & it does have spf. BUT...I have to say the price is ridiculous considering how much is gone in such a short time & I only use it a couple of times a day. I wanted it to wear under my lipstick for moisture but my lipstick slides of quickly when I have this on.,1
"I'm truly in love with this particular set (the shampoo, the cream conditioner, and this marinating oil. They don't work miracles but they definitely do good things for my hair. And the scent is sooo amazing, they need to make it in body wash form, lotion, and leave in conditioner. ",0
"I must admit that I am a bit of a tough customer when it comes to buying beauty basics such as foundation and blush. My skin is very fair in the fall and winter months, but as soon as the warmer weather comes I can quite darkly. When i bought this shade of blush i was skeptical when the Sephora make up artist told me that the Orgas.m shade would work with my skin no matter what the season. I am happy to say that this shade of blush added just the right shade of color and shimmer to my skin whether it was bronze or porcelain. I would highly recommend this blush to anyone who wants a natural and beautiful glow all year long.",0
"I must be one of the few people who did not like this product. I didnt find it did anything for my hair except make it look greasy. The product also seems to seperate in the tube, shake it before you use if you buy it. I ended up returning it to the store. ",2
"I must say I have not used liquid foundation in years. Reasons are, my skin is very oily and acne prone. I was introduced to this line by a Sephora Associate,(thank you) who tried this on my skin. This product has changed my feelings on liquids. Not only does it have excellent ingredients, It feels so light, never greasy to the touch and it stays on. It builds very nicely on skin with no blotchiness. I use NP5, I have light/medium skin color and it matches perfectly. So far I am amazed...does not increse my oil and so far no breakouts! ",3
"I must say that this is the best skin cream I have ever used! The jar says results can be seen within a few days, well it's so true my skin looks flawless and it glows so beautifully i can just go anywhere without makeup and still look great.",0
"I must say this is my fav. be collection yet lip color is great, eye colors are very nice. Never had a better color then the ruby radience would love to see it sold by it's self really makes cheek bones pop. clutch is adorble. ",0
"I'm very excited this is sulfate free. Moisturizes extremely well, cleared up some little dry patches, and smells great. I already use Ojon shampoo, so I couldn't tell much difference in performance as a shampoo. But I love it as a cleanser, face wash, and using the conditioner in a hot shower as a body moisturizer is AMAZING. ",1
I'm very picky when it comes to mascara. The Two-Timer is a good one but the eye makeup remover that came with the mascara is terrible. It DOES NOT remove the Two-Timer at all! I had to use my other mascara remover. That is why I only gave it 2 stars. ,4
"In addition to all of the reasons you want a good eye shadow (good pigment, no creases, easy blending), what I love about this product is that it doesn't have a ""heavy or shiny"" look, which is great for us more ""mature"" gals. In other words, it isn't ""aging-looking"" . Gives me a soft, smooth eyelid! ",4
"In a nutshell, these are the ABSOLUTE BEST lipsticks I have ever tried, and I'm almost 45 and have tried just about every brand out there! They're just what they say, rich and creamy but provide vibrant, true colors that last for HOURS!",2
In between manicures I like to make sure my nails stay looking neat. Since using this I think my nails are looking better. I have almost cleared away the ridges and my nails are starting to grow and last longer. I used to have to get gel manicures so they wouldn't break I now have longer nails with the wear and tear of the gel. My nails don't break as easily. ,4
Indian Red is a beautiful deep brown red however application of this product is tricky. The look is very intense... beautiful for evening wear but a bit intense for day. Appl carefully within lip line. Dab with lipbrush or finger and allow it to set-up. It will stay all night. If you don't blend it will slip and smear. ,4
"I needed a good pair of tweezers and thought these would be a good buy. For everyday plucking they are not good, you can only get a hair if using the very tip of the tweezer. Towards the base the tweezer opens up a bit and leaves a gap, preventing you from pulling a hair. These are good for only getting that one little out of reach hair. Not a good buy. ",0
"I never fail to receive complements on this fragrance when I wear it. It is so clean and fresh and does not overpower you. Most people say ""What is that fragrance you're wearing, it smells incredible!"" ",4
I never get sick of Philosophy's Amazing Grace Body Firming Emulsion! It smells heavenly and it lasts! I use it after I take a shower at night before bed. When I wake up in the morning and throw the covers off of me the smell of Amazing Grace is uncovered along with me!! It makes me happy!! Stock up on this stuff - it totally rocks and it's totally worth it!!,1
"I never liked liquid liner in the past because it always came off before the day was done. Not so with this product! It glides on and stays put until you take it off. The brush is easy to handle. It's not a thin, little handle that you have trouble holding. The product itself is great and goes on solid with one application. I am buying numerous shades to use with whatever color I am wearing that day. ",3
"I never put on eyeshadow without a primer. I tried this and it's great! My eyeshadow appears more vibrant, sparkles stay put, no creases, and it keeps the color on all day and night long. My only problem is the bottle. I feel like you can't get all of it out and a lot of wasted on the brush. I switched to Too Faced's eyeshadow insurance and it works just as well and I feel like I can get more out of the tube. ",0
"I never thought id be so excited to buy soap before.\nIt is the most incredibly clean scent, and it lasts and lasts - i have the buffer as well which has microbeads and then with the lotion it lasts allll day.",1
"I never thought I would ever use another mascara besides a Lancome mascara! This is works so well. I have naturally long and thick lashes, so I usually only apply one coat. It doesn't clump, or crumble off, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes. If you wear contact lenses as I do, I would highly recommend this mascara and every other Dior product I have ever used! ",0
"i never thought that i would spend this much on a cleanser ... but it is amazing! i have skin that dries easily and this keeps my skin normal, glowing, and beautiful! i can't get enough of the stuff ... a make-up removing cleanser that is not drying, yes please!!",0
"I never use foundation because my skin is pretty clear, but I wanted something that would make me look polished, yet natural when I go out. I really LOVE this Clinique tinted moisturizer. I have fairly light skin with some freckles and this tinted moisturizer does a good job of evening out my skin while still letting my freckles peak through. It achieves the exact look I want...clean, fresh skin. I especially love the fact that it has a bit of sunscreen in there. I live in Hawaii so I am really paranoid about the effects of the sun on my skin and the humidity here is not makeup friendly. This tinted moisturizer feels great on my skin; like I'm not wearing anything at all. The only negatives are that I am not too crazy about the scent and if you have really dry skin you may need to layer a separate moisturizer underneath. ",1
"I never was able to use cream or liquid cheek stains,just couldn't get the hang of it till Vincent Longo's lip and cheek stain. Never too bright, blends so well and gives a natural glow from within not on top of the skin. ",4
I never wear foundation only self-tanner occasionally. I purchased this to wear on my wedding day however I ordered the wrong color. I sprayed a little on my wrist and also felt like it was just too much coverage for me. My wedding is outdoors in the afternoon and I just didn't feel comfortable having something like this on. I ended up returning it. From what I could tell it looked like it gave a nice smooth finished look to the skin though,2
"Initially I liked the creamy feel of this mascara on my lashes and the black was stunning. I liked the slight curling effect on my lashes. However, one work out a the gym found me with smudges under my eyes making me look like a raccoon! I also found that wearing this mascara for a full day left me with smudged lids as well. Boo Hoo! ",3
"Initially, I used this product on my face and hands; ultimately, I switched to hands-only because my face really didn't need it. My hands have improved markedly. The spots have faded over the course of the first bottle of Murad that I bought. I have already re-ordered to have a bottle as backup.\nMy skin is medium fair, which may be a part of my success with this product (I have read dissatisfied comments from people with darker skin). Also, I am aware that it contains hydroquinone, which some may choose to avoid. I debated about it for awhile, but ultimately decided to go with it. I'm happy that I did.",4
"initially, i was skeptical of this product because it was oil, and i wasn't sure i wanted to try it, but it proved me wrong! it actually lathers up, and leaves skin smooth and refreshed. i love this product :] ",0
"In my climate winter is right around the corner. I wanted to find a product that would help protect my fine limp hair but still give it a little boost. Ojon is great. I love the texture the smell, everything. I highly recommend this line to anyone that has fine hair. ",1
"In my opinion, the best part of this makeup palette is the eyeshadow collection. I love experimenting with different colors and combinations, and for the price, this is the way to go! I'm not impressed with the brushes and shadow applicators. I also can't figure out how to best use the lipstick samples. They have a hard consistancy and the lipstick brush loses bristles every time I use it. I also don't like using my finger to apply lipstick, so that is out of the question. The six blushes are OK, but are not really the best colors for me. That said, this is still a great value just for the eyeshadow collection. ",2
"Inner Grace has just the right amount of fragrance for me. I like all the grace scents but this one seems to be made just for me. If you like floral, then this one is not for you. Amazing Grace has more of a floral scent, Pure Grace smells like soap and water, and Inner Grace is similar to Pure Grace but they've added a touch of something that is the best. I really don't know how to describe it, but it's a great scent. Don't be surprised if someone tells you that you ""smell so good."" ",3
Inner Grace is my favorite Philosophy fragrance. I find myself choosing it everyday over all the pricey fragrances that I own.People ask what I'm wearing when I have it on. The three piece Layering Collection is a great value over buying the collection separately. I will never be without this fragrance set! ,3
"Inner Grace Perfumed Shampoo, Bath & Shower Gel is soothing to the soul and senses. It has a luxurious lather and soft scent that I can't get enough of! It leaves my skin soft and smells ""scentsational"". People often ask what I'm wearing. After the shower, I layer it with the Body Lotion. It's fabulous! ",3
"In one small compact, you have all the colors you'll need for this winter. They are beautiful, full colors. You'll never have to worry if you grabbed the right lip color to carry in your purse. Great value, too!! ",4
"I normally hate eyebrow pencils. But this brow pencil is easy to apply, doesn't feel nasty and waxy, and is easy to comb through once applied. I overplucked a while ago, and it's the only thing i can fill in the bare spots with!.",1
"I normally like Ole Henriksen products, but this one has been hit or miss with me. Sometimes it feels quite soothing and refreshing, leaving the skin soft and smooth and hydrated. At other times, it burns and causes redness and puffiness. I don't know why the difference, and maybe that is not the norm, but wanted to mention the possibility for others. If this were consistent with me I would give it 5 stars, but since it is not I will give it 3 stars. Might be best to use it only occasionally. ",4
I noticed a huge difference when I first applied this mascara...lashes were much fuller looking and not clumped at all. It also seems to stay on all day long without the blach smudging under the eyes. ,3
"I noticed a very, very slight change to the plump factor. It will make your lips tingle slightly and some reddness can appear. It makes the perfect lip gloss bc its slight stickyness keeps it around for awhile! LIX works well under/over lipliner. The design of the container isn't great as I experience leakage; and the applicator brush does not go all the way to the bottom of the clear tube. As with all lip plumpers I've used, I experience drying/peeling of the lips and using LIX was no different :-( ",2
"I now know what helps remove the residual makeup you just have work at to remove when using soap. this breaks down the oils from within the product and from your skin. I do not find the scent offensive at all, far more pleasant than rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol. In addition, the additives are less drying on the brush hairs than using alcohol alone. Use this product in between general soapings and as a jump starter prior to maintenance cleansing with soap. Aftershampooing your brushes and blotting the excess water with a towel , you can spray some of this on them to sanitize them if you wish. This is an excellent cleaner for the price and a must have in order to protect your brush investment and give you consistent, makeup application results. ",4
"In the winter, my lips were VERY dry and nothing was working ... I purchased an $18 high-end lip repair product that did NOTHING! I got this little tin of shea butter in a travel gift set from L'Occitane and tried it on my lips ... and it WORKED! This stuff is the BEST! Though it tastes a little blah at first, the taste disappears quickly and your lips stay soft and moist.",1
"I often suffer from lack of sleep so am always looking for products help make this fact less obvious. It doesn't really correct dark circles, but it feels good and adds moisture. I found it works a lot better with the ooh la lift, from benefit. A good product but becomes better when combined. ",1
"I ordered 2 shades - Barbarella and Morocco - and unfortunately I am very disappointed with both. The colors don't look at all as shown - Barbarella is a VERY light coral, and Morocco is quite a bit darker than shown. I also don't like the smell and consistency (dry!) of these lipsticks at all.",2
"I ordered ""Bambi"" online, and the color isn't exactly what I expected, but I like it. The gloss tingles for a long time, but I can't tell that it really makes my lips look fuller. I like the fact that it's not sticky and it doesn't dry my lips.",4
I ordered one of these kits last year as well with different scents. The only advice I might give is that I make sure before I buy it that there is at least one sample that I know I would really want a full bottle of. This way disappointment is not possible! It's great fun to have so many choices to try and I would think it would make a super gift. ,4
"I ordered the 5 oz. body spray because the perfume was out at the time and I was really hoping to like it due to its popularity but I ended up sending it back. The scent is nice, but too musky for me, i'm sure it's great for other people though and if you like more musk then I would definitely buy this, just not for me.",0
"I ordered the chocalate brown color, and I was satisfied with the longevity of the liner, as I line my lower lash line. Although the chocalate brown gives off a slightly red tint, so I will probably order a different brown color next time. Would like more product for the amount it costs, as the pencil is small in size. ",1
"I ordered the Metro Chic, Never Enough Shoes and Don't Go There shades, and I love all three. Metro Chic has to be the first grey-colored polish I've seen, so I just had to try it. I love the shades and the names! Liked them so much I had to get Because I Said So at the store, but they were out of Call Your Mother. :( ",2
"I ordered these for some high school girls to use in the fall musical and they are spectacular, although one is have some trouble putting them on. So far they've held up for three shows. They are worth the effort of putting on and generally very attractive, even when not on a stage. ",3
"I ordered the wrong mascara. I have used YSL waterproof mascara for the last couple of years, and this is not the right one. I don't notice any lengthening, and it doesn't make my lashes stand out like the other YSL waterproof one did. There is no Sephora in The Palm Desert area or I would take it back. I will be ordering the RIGHT one next time. This one doesn't do what it says it will. ",4
"I ordered this along with my foundation in DF1-light. I have a cosmetic bag full of expensive concealers that don't work that, sure, I was iffy about this to. But once tried, I was truly blown away about how little it took to cover up my dark circles. They are something that I just could not cover up...no matter how hard I tried, without being heavy handed with foundation which I hate to do...The concealer stick on this in combination with the roller ball makes the difference...the circles were GONE..They were not faded...they were gone..and I loved the highlighter for my brow bone and tops of my cheek bones...what a plus that was...LORAC is now my new FAVORATE makeup..my skin looks polished, with a glow...it's never looked better...I don't kow if my experience was because I also used the correct foundation, but,it could be a combination of the two products...all I know is the products worked for me in a way no others had...and now I'm loving how I look, and using this product every day just to get the look. It's well worth the price..Make sure you get your matching shade... ",3
I ordered this because it was a good prices to try the C-eye cream and sunblock moisturizer. I was concerned I would break out with more white heads. I didn't. I totally love the sunblock moisturizer. It's not too thick and smells great. The eye cream takes the sting out of my dry irritated skin around my eyes too. I will definitely continue to use them. ,2
"I ordered this because of all of the great reviews.\nThe blush that flatters any skintone! Well, looks okay\non me but I have some $5 blush that looks just as good\nand would probally flatter just as many cheeks as this\none.The price brings it way down in my opinion.",2
I ordered this eye-liner brush on-line to qualify for free shipping. It has turned out to be the best eye liner brush I have bought in the last 30 years and I have bought dozens. I highly recommend it! ,4
"I ordered this for a day moisturizer to go under Philosophy's ""the Present"", which I love. It came separated into a stiff mousse with an oily layer. Can't wear it during the day because I don't have enough time before work for the shine to soak in. Also, it has made my face break out. I will use it on other skin to use it up, but I am still looking for that good one step sunscreen moisturizer. ",3
"I ordered this for my 17 year-old daughter who has a head of very heavy curly hair. Being a teen, she is forever plagued with oily hair and is thrilled with this stuff--as opposed to baby powder, which can leave traces on her dark strands. ",3
"I ordered this liner shadow after trying the basic liner shadow with the starter kit. I ordered it because I have green eyes and it really made them pop. It is very pretty and nice for some variety in the basic neutral look. Also, like all the Bare Minerals liner shadows, it has staying power. ",4
"I ordered this product after trying a free sample and getting asked if my teenager was really mine (the guy said I looked 25, but I'm 40)! I figured that was reason enough to see if this tinted moisturizer would help me look younger all the time. It goes on a bit light, but seems to match my complexion as I get it blended. It leaves a shiny look, but perhaps that is what makes it better than cakey products that settle in fine lines. ",2
I ordered this product because part of the proceeds support breast cancer research. I then read the reviews and I was surprised and shocked! I couldn't smell any scent and it doesn't taste good (actually no taste at all). I had to keep looking at the label to make sure I got the same thing as everyone who wrote a review. It's too early for me to determine if it works good for my lips at this point. I'm just putting it on for the first time and it feels sticky with a glossy shine. ,2
"I ordered this the second they become available and could not wait to get my package in the mail. It was worth the wait. The smells are fabulous. I especially like the carmel mocha and the eggnog loatte. In fact, I like them so much that I'm ordering the full sizes today ",3
I originallt got this cleanser as a delux sample from Sephora and was turned into an overnight addict! I am a big fan of experimenting withmy m akeup...which used to involve a barage of creams and tonics to remove completely. Purity is a one step miracle earaser.....and the best part? It doesnt dry out my skin! I'm a fan for life!,1
"i originally bought these to use as a cream base for my regular eyeshadows, but their so vibrant (like theater makeup), i found myself using the cream colors alone. i highly recommend use of an eyeshadow primer underneath these if you have oily lids or the cream will start to crease. ",2
"I originally got this in the Starter kit and after I used it all up, I was not going to replace it. I have good skin, but a hard time finding moisturizers that I like. My skin actually got worse after I stopped using it, so I bought 2 more bottles and haven't had a problem since then. But, I don't really consider this a moisturizer, but more of a primer for your face. I love this stuff!!! ",2
I originally got this mascara as a sample and ended up buying a full size.It doesn't necessarily curl my eyelashes but it does give it length and volume.I like that it doesn't clump up and it coats nicely. ,1
"I originally got this with my start up kit and am now hooked. I use this every day as my moisturizer. It is light weight, fast absorbing, and non greasy. I have oily skin and this works great for people with oily skin. ",2
"I originally purchased this product as an alternative to the Evian mist Sephora carries (they were out of the Evian so this was recommended). At first I was a little unsure of the product because I just wanted something that I could spray on throughout the day to give me a refreshed feeling.\nThis product is incredible! Not only does it do what I wanted but I've noticed that by spraying it on immediately after I put on my make up it ""sets"" my look. It also feels really good when you spray it on your skin prior to your moisturizer. It has a cooling feeling and the scent isn't over-powering.\nSince falling in love, I've snuck the small bottle into every one of my friends' gifts (well those who used the Evian spray) and all of them have since converted.",1
"I originally tried this because the bottle was beautiful. What's inside is even better. Cleans away any residue left from cleanser, or leftover dirt, refreshes your skin as well, and it looks great on my dresser.",2
"I own every lavanila shine - I really love the fact that it's all natural ...it doesn't even have artificial sweetener! The flavors are all great...my favorite is the pure vanilla (clear), followed by vanilla grapefruit (pink shimmer), vanilla blossom (apricot shimmer) and vanilla coconut (nude clear). Not tacky AT ALL and I don't feel bad about eating it off my lips because there aren't any chemicals and it's filled with vitamins. The shine is the best part. Very glossy - i like to DAB on the lips (not rub it in) for the highest impact. When it's gone, my lips are SOoooo soft. ",1
"I own every tone of red that Francois Nars has created in his line. Every time I wear either Red Lizard, Fire down below, Scarlet Empress, people flip. There is a dangerous persona you take on when you were red, and if you are looking for a HOT red, look no further!!!",1
"I own five of these (black, copper, chocolate, metal, silver) and I love them all! They stay on a long time. They smudge really easily, which is good for all of them except the black. They're probably the best eyeliners I ever bought. ",0
I own Torrid and absolutely love it. The color blends really well on my skin. It creates contour for my face without adding too much color. It has shimmer so better for night time. I will recommend it to all Asians. I also tried on Orgasm but it didn't work at all for me even though it does have peachy/golden shimmer. Orgasm is better for fair - ligh skin tone I think.,1
"I own two of these eyeshadows and I just bought them because they were very attractive. They go on smoothly but doesn't blend 100% well. Im not sure if I'm not putting it on correctly but I think it's the ingredients they use. It is really pretty though if you're using them in the corner of you eyes. Everyone always compliments the colors I got. I own the black one with glitter I think it's called Night Breed and the Dark Green with glitter. It does come off little by little thruoghout the night, at least with my experience. But overall I give it 4 stars because no other brands compare to these colors and they last forever. I think it's good if you liek the smokey eyes for night life. I havent' tried their light color collection so I can't comment. I recommending trying it on your jawline and hands before purchasing so you get a good view on what I'm talking about. I think it varies with your skin tone :) ",0
I picked up a trial size of this at a sephora store.I am over 50 with very dry skin on my cheeks and oily on my nose.This was so increadible gentle and did not dry my face out. the only down side as with most fresh products is the price.I will have to save my pennies for this one !,3
I prefer lip stains to sticks; but this is actually a very nice lipstick! The color isn't extreme and makes sense on a SAHM. It lasts through my morning coffee. My lips feel softer after applicationi. The best part: my hair doesn't stick to my lips while I play with my child. ,1
"I pride myself on always using high quality foundation..at least...I had gotten a free sample of this particular product in a previous order, and loved it soooo much I ordered a full size..It goes on smooth..is oil-free yet hydrating. It is anti-aging..believe me..my face has a wonderful soft glow, this foundation in #SMS2 makes my skin look younger..I don't have a whole lot of fine lines, but this makeup seees to address those problems and more..I LOVE IT...I don't usually rave about make-up...but, I'll make an exception for LORAC..I also ordered the DOUBLE FEATURE concealer/highlighter in light...excellent... ",3
"I purchased 2 kits already. It has all you need. I use the lighter tone as a ""concealer"" and mix the medium tone with the light tone to create a finished look. The mineral veil seals the deal, and makes you look flawless. Everytime I wear it, I get so many compliments on my skin. Everyone I have recommended this product to, LOVES IT. What a great kit. It is worth the low price because it works and last a long long time. Light yet covers everythng. ",2
"I purchased Ashes to Ashes because I wanted the Sephora /NARS ""Get the Look"" Smokey eye. The look was so very easy using Ashes to Ashes. I only purchase two brands of eyeshadow & Nars is one of them!! ",1
"I purchased Black Emerald, Sailor (navy blue), and Butterfly (yellow) just by looking at the online color swatches. When I first opened the package, the Butterfly appeared to be the only true color swatch. Sailor looks really blue in the container, but can be controlled with just a little on the brush. It goes on darker than it appears. I really like it. Sailor also makes an absolutely WONDERFUL liner! I was very unsure of the Black Emerald because it mostly looks black in the container with just a shimmer of green. I didn't even try it out for two weeks, but when I did I was very happy with the color. I use VERY little of this color and make sure to tap the excess off the brush for a soft contour of my brow bone. This color also makes a great liner. I'm quite pleased with my color choices. I like that all the BE shadows, regardless of color, apply in the same manner and give consistent results. Butterfly looks much better on me with BE eyelid primer under it. ",3
"I purchased Niagara and it was too bold for my lips, so I exchanged it for Barbarella, which is such a nice color. It is a light coral-ish color, not too vibrant nor strong. It is quite moisturizing and creamy. Love the texture it gives off to your lips. It is long-wearing too.",0
I purchased Runway Red (which looks different in person than the sample color online). This is a beautiful sheer red that has some staying power. There is nothing better than finding a lipstick color that is flattering. Plus this lipstick is packed with moisture. The pink capsule with the jewel top makes this product a must have. ,3
"I purchased Secret because I have been looking for this particular shade in a lip liner. it goes on creamy-smooth, then sets beautifully. however, for the cost, the pencil does not last long. [the color lasts on the lips, but the product itself runs out too soon.] and once the little cylindrical insert of color gets low, it likes to attempt to leap out of its housing. this seems to be the nature of many mechanical lip pencils. the formula IS superior, but I'll search for this shade in a non-mechanical lip pencil form. ",2
"I purchased Strawberry Daiquiri and really like the color. The lipstick is very soft and feels good on my lips. Because of the softness of the product, it has a tendency to 'move' in the tube causing the lipstick to lean after applying. Hence, if you don't straighten it, the product scrapes along the side of the tube - wasteful and messy. ",4
"I purchased Sunkissed Cheek Stain and love it! It's much better than the earlier versions that were liquid, very messy and awkward to apply. I recently lost my makeup bag and plan to purchase this immediately again! Looks great on bare face or full makeup. ",3
"I purchased the clutch bag, triangle bag and pencil case. These are very attractive, and I like the contrast lining in teal. The ""white"" in the pattern is more light beige than white (which is fine, just looked white in the photo above to me). There is a lot of room in each of these bags. The clutch bag was a gift and the recipient loves it. She packed it with all her essentials and the case still has enough room so that it isn't ""fat"" in her handbag. Same thing with the triangle bag (great all-around makeup bag) and the pencil case (which I use for carrying repair refresh items such as tweezers, nail clippers/file, toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, hand lotion, etc.). The sale price is quite nice, too! ",4
"I purchased the Fire Down Below. While the lipstick is a little dry for a lip gloss girl such as myself, I am IN LOVE with this color. I have honey-tan skin and it is REALLY hard to find a red that suits me without looking like I'm auditioning for the circus. Perfection",0
"I purchased the fruit scented whipped body delights first, I loved them... so when I saw the Ice Cream set I had to try it. I really like the vanilla frosting and peppermint mocha... I really wish Sephora would consider making them larger, I think that would make a lot of people happy. ",1
"I purchased the Meteorites in Mystic. I can't figure out how this product works- but it makes a big difference in the way my skin looks. It doesn't glitter,it doesn't sparkle,it just makes my skin look good.It is well worth the price and it seems as though it will last for a long time. I'd love to try a sample of the gold color (hint hint). Did I mention that it has a lovely smell? ",4
"I purchased the perfume & the smell is absolute Wonderful. Then, I decided to place the order for the Body Lotion to go with it. However, it turned out to be a lil' disappointed. The plastic bottle & the charm looked ""cheap"". The lotion isn't that rich or creamy. The smell some how different too!!!!!",0
I purchased the plum and just love the color. The eyeliner goes on easily and the mascara is nice too. No problem with smudging. So convenient to have them both in the same tube. Now I'm thinking of ordering the other colors! ,3
I purchased the Raspberry Sorbet for my Daughter for Christmas - If I would have know that there was a store close by I could have saved the shipping cost. Need to communicate with customer of stores in area.,4
"I purchased the Sephora sampler of 10 mascaras and went through it systematically twice, wearing a different mascara each day, so I could compare. Of all ten, this was the worst. It didn't go on well, took multiple coats to show up, but the worst part was the raccoon eyes that appeared after wearing it. While only applied to my top lashes, it seemed I got a centimeter of residue underneath my eyes. ",2
"I purchased the spray oil hoping to use it in place of lotion. It goes on nice and the scent is great. However, after a few hours, my legs look dry again. I still use it when I'm in a hurry to get ready. ",2
I purchased the UD Glitter Eye Gel quite some time ago. Back when they had 5-7 more colors. The gel goes on so nice & it's easy to use! You can have a understated look or a full on glamour look!! My favorite part of this item is the lasting staying power the gel has...I literally have some tubes that are still good & vibrant a YEAR LATER!!! For that reason alone I gave this product (5) stars! All Urban Decay products are amazing & the glitter eye gel lives up to the reputation of quality that UD products have!!! ,2
"I purchased this as a gift, but also use it myself. It truly is a hairspray which does what the manufacturer claims it will do. It holds the hair in place and protects it against frizziness! Not an easy task to accomplish. ",4
I purchased this as a gift for my mom and I think it's a great gift idea for any beauty loving girl! She loves eyeshadows and this is a good set for her to play with color and see what colors work best for her. The lip stuff and blushes are just a bonus. ,0
I purchased this collection for my mom & she totally loves it! She especially loves the ballerina when you open it! The colors are fun & flirty. So many different looks! It's amazing! I will be purchasing one for myself!!! ,2
I purchased this for my son after I had received a sample with a previous purchase. I LOVE this scent!!!!!!!!!!! It's not overpowering yet it lasts throughout the day. It's such a clean scent and it can be worn anytime of the year. ,3
I purchased this fragrance about 2 months ago. I can say honestly it made me very light headed. If you prefer less sweet scents this isn't for you. This fragrance surprised me because the scent faded shortly after applied. Besides all of the negative comments- great gift for teens! ,1
I purchased this fragrance for my boyfriend and I love it on him. It is warm and not too over powering. It is an unusual scent. I have never smelt anything else like it.\nHe is now using his second bottle of this fragrance and I am sure we will purchase it again.,2
"I purchased this in Fantasy. These are colors I normally don't use, but I love them. The eye shadow is long lasting and stays on all day. I find the eye shadow is a bit ""soft"" and tends to sort of flake around my eye when applying. Perhaps I'm not using the right brush and I just need to be a bit more careful. I would recommend this product (I've received several compliments). ",4
"I purchased this item for traveling. It fits nicely in my purse and is very convenient to use. I was especially interested in the varying colors in the palette. The products goes on smoothly and feels creamy, but has staying power. I am very happy and will purchase again. ",4
"I purchased this last winter because my skin is dry generally but gets very dry in winter. It was true to it's word that my skin was kept very moist all day. It feels very good putting it on, it's not greasy and absorbs quickly. It has a nice clean scent to. I will definitely buy it again this winter when the cold weather kicks in. ",2
"I purchased this once I noticed my hair getting thinner (which freaked me out as I'm a 32 year old woman!). I used it as directed, twice a week for a while and then once a week. It makes my hair fuller, shinier, and I think it has even helped decrease new grey hairs. Now I use it once a week or every other week and no longer worry about hair loss. ",1
I purchased this product and some of the products do seem to be dried out..I thought it was just me..but it does say on the package to run it under warm water to make the product more fluid..WHAT???? The DuWop seems to be the one that is dried out..oh well ..Love this idea..But next time Sephora...please make the mascara's more liquidy.. ,4
"I purchased this product because I have very thin brows, and I wanted to fill them in without looking fake, this brow pen has such a natural color that mother asked if I had had a hair transplant...I have dark skin my mother has fair skin and it worked great and looked great on both of us ",2
"I purchased this product because I really enjoy Bliss products & thought it would save on my trips to my local day spa. Boy, was I wrong! The shaver & attachments are so cheap!! & the attachments do not work well!! It's a waste of money!!! ",2
"I purchased this product because I thought it would totally eliminate my skin from looking oily. It didn't do that. I was told it would help and I didn't see a difference. If you are looking for a cleanser that's fast and easy, this is for you, but it won't fix the oiliness...at least it didn't for me. ",1
"I purchased this product in the past (from a different supplier) and was extremely happy with it. However, I purchased this recently from Sephora and I'm extremely disappointed. It is clumpy, pasty, and I can not use it. I will be returning it for a refund.",4
"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ON THE ADVICE OF MY LOCAL SEPHORA CONSULTANT WHO RAVED THAT I WOULD SEE RESULTS IN THE FADING OF LIVER OR AGE SPOTS WITHIN THREE MONTHS, I HAVE AFTER MORE THEN THREE MONTHS NOT SEEN ANY IMPROVEMENT AFTER USING 75% OF THE BOTTLE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",3
"I purchased this product to put some basic essentials in the bottom of my handbag so that I could avoid rooting around my bag for what I need. I keep a small travel brush, a few lip glosses, mascara, eyeliner, an eyelash curler, mascara and a small size hand lotion. All fits perfectly and takes up such little room. It did what I needed it to do. Love it! ",1
"I purchased this product to use as a concealer for covering brown spots, blemishes, scrars and other skin imperfections. I find it does not cover my brown spots completely, but it works better than other products I have tried. I like the fact it has the added SPF.",4
"I purchased this product while visiting NYC and used it while I was there. It worked so well I thought it would be my only concealer going forward. Unfortunately, when I arrived home and to drier climate, it didn't work quite as well and I returned to my powder concealer. I still think it's a great product, but with my oily skin, it's best used in humid climates. ",3
"I purchased this product with the hopes of applying it over my lightweight foundation and then under my bronzing powder. I was very pleased with the results - if I happen to have a blemish, the smashbox concealer does the trick without causing pealing. ",3
"I purchased this set after reading so many reviews on this lipstick. I have to say that I do like it. It is not really a lipstick but gives you a glossy fresh berry color to your lips. I do love the shimmering bronzer. It gives you a nice glow and not too much color, but just enough. I especially like it on the top of my cheeks to really highlight them. ",1
"I purchased this set originally when it included a sample of the nightcream. I am extremely pleased with the results, so much so that I have since purchased the full size Eye Treament too. There are a lot of products on the market and new ones being developed all the time so it can become overwhelming with all the claims. This product line is definitely hard to beat as an addition to my skincare regimen. At 57, my skin has not looked this good nor have I felt this confident about going out without makeup in a very long time! ",4
"I purchased this set to try L'Occitane for the first time. These products are quality products. I LOVE the shower gel, rich and very moisturizing. My husband LOVE the hand cream. He works outside and it keeps them from cracking. Definitely worth the money! ",3
"I purchased this simply because I wanted a cute lip compact to keep in my purse. I bought All For Brown and the colors are nice neutrals, which is what I usually go for. I like the texture and feel of the colors and they go on really nice. ",1
"I purchased two of these and as soon as they came, I emptied them both of the mineral veil and replaced one with tinted mineral veil and the other with my Bare Minerals foundation. They are so convenient to use. Thank you Sephora! ",3
"I purchased two of these for my16- and 17-year-old grand daughters. it's ideal for them to try new looks and a very good value for me. Most every color is suitable for an older teen and the presentation is great! My only disappointment is that I had to buy brushes for the girls to use the products; however, Sepora has a very reasonable brush set that even matches the cute little music box. Nice gift! ",4
"i purched this primer in february of 08 i really love this product it goes on great it keep my makeup set all day. in the beginning i wasnt aware that it leaves a matte finish. i like a dewy sort of finish i think i will try lara gellers spackle i heard great reviews for that. overall its a great product but, i just dont like a matte finish on dry skin.",2
"I put this mask on after the shower and it felt wonderful! Gave me a good amout of moisture and my skin was glowing (not oily). It is a bit on the pricey side...but a little goes a long way, so it is worth it.",2
"I rarely find an eye shadow I like enough to buy more than once (let alone eight!) but I will definitely be purchasing this one again. The colors range from sheer and sparkly to a deep rich hue. I see myself using this thru the winter, into summer and all year long! ",1
I rarely wear eyeliner because I always have difficulty putting it on finely enough. I like the brush on this eye liner. It is thin enough to make it easy to apply and the formula lasts all day without smudging. I bought it in the deep black and will try it in white and in the glitter colors as well. It's a great eye-liner for a very reasonable price. ,4
I read about how amazing this cleanser was an a makeup blog I read weekly. Then my roomate started using it to cleanse in the morning because it was not as harsh as her evening face wash. I thought I owed it to my skin to give it a try and I definitly was NOT disappointed. It gives you a gentle feeling but you can tell that is getting deep into the pores. I also am a girl who is affected the changes in wheater (i.e. my skin dries out insanely fast) and I havent had any problems with Purity drying me out. If you don't want to buy the large size bottle definitly drop the 10 dollars to try it out.,0
"I read about this in a blog and had to try it. Many women my age and older raved about it. I have to say that I love how it goes on and the way that it makes my skin feel. I have now used it long enough yet to note a real difference, but I am expecting to see one. ",4
I read about this product and thought - do I really need ANOTHER product on my face after my moisturizer? After trying it the answer is a resounding YES. It makes my foundation go on so smoothly. It seems strange if I don't use it.\n\nThis is one of my best picks for make-up of all time.,2
"I read about this product in a bridal magazine and made it part of my beauty kit for the big day! I loved the way it enhanced the ""natural glow"" of brides. I received so many compliments courtesy of this one little powder! I still use it every day, sometimes as an all-over face powder, other times just as a blush when I want a natural look. ",3
"I read all the early posts on this set, and I agree...this is good stuff! I really like every item, and the Balance and Brighten is my new favorite. I used to use mineral makeup, but this stuff lasts all day whereas minerals don't. I have combination skin and not having to blot or touch up is a big plus. ",3
"I read a lot of reviews and was prepared to wait a month or more to see results, but in twelve days my lashes are double the thickness and length. Now they look great even naked! I was a little put off by the price, but it's entirely worth it! What a great birthday gift to give yourself! ",2
"I read reviews before ordering and thought I'd give this a try due to the ease of use and volumizing effect. Well, the spray definitely added volume to my hair, but took out the shine. My hair had a very matte, dry texture and dull tone. Also, the smell (notice I use the word smell not aroma) lingers in the room where it is sprayed. ",3
I read the description and thought I would give it a try. WOW! The brush is the best - very soft. And the product itself leaves my skin luminess and soft. I was happy when I actually received this because there was more than I thought I was getting! If you can get this - GET IT! ,2
"I reallllllly like this cleanser. I love the texture and foam, iit feels fabulous as I wash my face and it doesn't have any icky smells or any residue. When I'm done washing my face feels squeeky clean, but not tight or itchy like I get with a lot of other brands. I also love that this is gentle enough to use on the eyes so you can take your eye makeup off with it as well. This is similar to Philosopy's ""Purity Made Simple,"" but I think this is even more gentle and perhaps even better... I'll have to use this product a bit longer to really tell. Nevertheless, highly recommended!",1
"I really admire Kat Von D. she's a strong woman and a true artist. her tattoos are legendary. I expected a lot from her makeup line based on her powerful personality and strong fearless fashion sense. I ordered 'Gunshine' and was so excited when it arrived [her glosses had been sold out for awhile.] however, when I tried this gloss- which looked killer in the tube- I found it to be barely sparkly, wimpy, and with a thin formula. the doe's foot put out only a tiny bit of product. and where does all that fierce sparkle GO? I could barely see any in the mirror. I expected some glamour- all I got was a thin, shiny gloss with a sweet cherry scent [I liked that part] with some BARELY DETECTABLE glitter. Kat, what happened? I still think you are awesome, even if this product isn't. I found it to be quite ordinary, whereas Kat Von D is anything but. ",2
"I really couldn't figure out how one little blush could create so much hype...so I finally decided to try it. WOW...it's not hype, this blush is PERFECT...and I've tried a lot. These blushes are also a great value because they pack so much pigment, so a little goes a long way.",0
"I really do like this fragrance, just not on me. It smells like a fabric softener or dryer sheet to me. I spritz it on my bedding and curtains, even inside my closet. It doesn't leave a stain and my room has a clean fresh scent.",4
"I really don't care for this product. For cheeks, it's not too bad, but for lips it's not at all worth the money. It doesn't last any longer than any other lip color. Applying it is very difficult because it's like painting colored water on your lips. If you're of a ""certain age"" and have any lines in or around your lips, the liquid will quickly seek those out and then it's very difficult to get rid of it! I finally discovered that the best way to apply this is to use a foam-tipped applicator, like a lip gloss applicator, which I took from another failed lip color. With the foam applicator, you won't end up with this stain all over your fingers (a nice look) and it tends not to run as much because you can control the amount you're applying, rather than using the lame brush that comes in the lid of the bottle. This bottle will last a very long time because of its consistency. I'm afraid I'll spill it, though!",4
I really don't see any improvement in my skin tone. But this is such a nice product that i use it with my makeup primer. It's oil free and scent free. It makes your skin feel very nice. Helps my makeup go on smoother. ,3
"I really enjoy this scent, do not find it chemical-like at all. It smells crisp and fresh with just enough sweetness. I don't think it smells like Pledge, although it does have a tart lemony smell, of course. I find it uplifting and cheery, any time at all. My experience is that it does not last all that long though. I will purchase again. I want to try the ""Sugar"" w/o the lemon and see which I prefer. If you like to smell fresh and clean without a heavy ""perfumey"" odor, try this one. It's really nice. ",3
"I really had given up any hope of having my eyeshadow stay on all day. I could not figure out how everyone else did it until I bought this. This primer potion is easy to use, just wipe a little on the eyelids, apply your eyeshadow and it stays beautiful until you wash it off at night. I can even take a nap and get up and my eyemakeup looks like I just put it on! This is my new Gotta Have! Try it! ",2
I really like all the Buxom Lips I've purchased. The gloss lasts a long time. I wish Bare Escentuals had made the Buxom Babes Diamond Lips with sponge applicators instead of brushes...makes it harder to apply. ,4
"I really like all the colors, very nice for nighttime and parties. The price isn't the worst but even at the reduced price of $16.00 you are basically paying over $5.00 a piece for samples. I wouldn't have paid the original price of over $20.00. I like the tingle, not sure if it's as effective as the original but it works ok. All in all not my favorite recent purchase but I'll keep it. Too much trouble to take back. ",3
I really like bareMinerals eyeshadows and the glimmers are my favorite. The products are very shimmery but I like that the glitter is very fine and not large pieces. The glimmers are so pretty and I highly recommend trying them. ,0
"I really like citrus and fresh scents so this is absolutely perfect. Usually anything with even a trace of florals make me sneeze and give me a headache, but this has some floral undertones that smell really clean. Great for going out or day-to-day. I get compliments from strangers and cab drivers wearing this scent. It's amazing!",1
"I really liked the look and feel of this mascara. It looks trendy and when I got a sample came in a cute little bottle. However, it dries out so fast it's crazy. I got it because I had sampled it and then noticed I had purchased another cheaper brand that I knew didn't dry out after 2 weeks. Overall not too happy with this product because of it's short life span... btw, the bottle was closed tightly!",1
"I really liked the ruby radiance glow for the face, and as in the other collections the plumper-lipgloss and the brushes; but... the eyeshadows are not so great; more brown than ruby and for the mascara sorry to say but I did not like it at all; it clumps. ",4
"I really liked this eyeliner, but I couldn't manange to get it on without getting it all over my cheeks and under my eyes. Maybe I had too much on the brush...if not for that, I would have really like it. ",1
"I really liked this product for those days where you run out of time for the whole shower, blow dry, style type day. I really liked the smell of this shampoo. I am from the Pssst!! generation from the 60-70's when all we had was this stuff from Clairol that did the job, but..... My can of Pronto ran out after about 3 or 4 short sessions, so I figure at 5.00 per shampoo with this brand, I will probably not go down this road again. I really like the Klorane myself. ",4
I really liked what I got compared to the price I payed. The lip gloss is very mosturizing and soft. The mascara goes on smooth and does not clump while the black eye shadow creme lasts all day. I recommend that everyone should get this if they want great quality makeup. ,0
I really like many of the MD products and I really like this eye cream. Not too rich to cause breakouts but enough to reduce fine lines and brighten! You can also apply under makeup and not worry about running eyeliner! ,2
I really like that this lip butter uses natural moisturizers like shea and cocoa butter. It works well but I have to be careful not to apply to much because it gets a lot more glossy that your average lip balm. ,0
"I really like the color of this mascara; I wear it with blue mascara and blue eyeliner to make my eyes pop. I'm just not so crazy about the formula. I wish it went on thicker, but I just put an extra coat. ",2
"I really like the coverage Airflash provides, and once it is applied, it stays on. When I visit the chiropractor and my face is mushed into the padded headrest, I hardly ever leave any traces of foundation on the protective paper when I have Airflash on (unlike other foundations). It's messy to apply though, especially if you spray directly on your face and not onto a sponge first.",3
"I really like the cuticle care pen. I keep it in my purse and use it when waiting in line or riding in the car or plane. It does have a smell a little like tea tree oil, but it is not over powering. It does a great job. It is a little expensive but that would be my only complaint. ",2
"I really like the eyeshadow colors, the rest of was just ok. The blush was pretty pink, but may be better for summer with more of a tan. The lip gloss was to pink for me, but was a great gloss as usual! Didn't care for the mascara at all. The eyeshadow and brushes are worth the cost so I kept it. ",2
"I really like the idea of the kit so I can try it out :). So far I love the wash, it cleans without being drying. I'm not so sure about the spot treatment as I have tried it on some 'spots' and it doesn't seem to make a difference. I like the acne treatment gel , it really takes care of the oiliness in the t-zone area. So far, so good! If anything it really was worth it just to try the cleanser as I have been trying a lot lately and can't seem to find one that I really like-this may be the one! ",2
"i really like the staying power of this brow gel. you only need to apply once and you are good for the day. but just avoid touching your brows throughout the day because it starts to flake a little bit if you do. other than that, it's great - and a little goes a very long way, i wipe some off the brush before applying.",1
"I really like the texture of this eyeliner, the only thing is that it is so big that you can end up with a way thicker line than you were intending! I can manage, but if I'm in a hurry, I go for a different one because I have to make sure to take my time. I let my friend borrow it to do her eyes, and she is not comfortable using eyeliner, and she had a really tough time with it. But, if you're careful, it is worth it, a nice, smoky or liquid-like look! ",1
I really like this and it looks like a natural tan on your face without the dangers of the sun!! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that for $48 I hope that you get a a lot of product in the brush/container!! I just got it so I can't tell you how long it has lasted!! ,3
"I really like this and it's the best body wash I've found. It certainly improved my body acne, but it hasn't totally cured it, as some people have reviewed, so I only give it 4 stars. But you should definitely try it out because it is very refreshing and really helps a lot!",0
"I really like this body wash. The scent isn't too overpowering, and it does smell like a vanilla birthday cake. The name is really cute too. I find Philosophy's body washes do smell exactly like their names.\n\nI wish the bottles were a bit more creative, however. Good product, though. Lathers nicely. I don't use the body washes in my hair, however.",0
"I really like this brow compact. I have brown hair and both colors blend in to my eyebrows well. The wax is ok, except for me it never lasts as long as the powder so I end up running out with more than half of the powder left. The wax isn't really necessary, but it does help with those stray hairs that have a mind of their own! ",1
"I really like this brow gel, great for taming. I have thick, dark brows - this is probaly not the product if you need to fill in your brows. I find it works best, when you lightly apply it then use a toothbrush/ brow brush to smooth it through. If you use too much you will have really wet crunchy looking brows.",1
"I really like this brush belt. But, it has the worst smell to it! I have found a solution for the odor...I put (1) fabric softener sheet inside before closing it up. After (1) week I replaced the fabric softener sheet & put a fresh one in! It really absorbs the odor! Continue process until smell is gone(about 3-4 wks.) w/fabric softener! On a positive note, ALL my brushes fit & then some! ",2
"I really like this brush, its definately an alternative to those highend brushes such as MAC, Nars, MUFE etc. It's super soft and applies makeup perfectly. Why buy those expensive brushes when you can buy these and get the same effect? ",0
"I really like this conditioner. I love how it smells, but I don't think it did anything more for my color than a normal moisturizing shampoo, and therefore I don't think it's worth the money. It smells great and leaves hair silky, but there are cheaper products that do the same. ",0
"I really like this fragrance. It isn't heavy or overly flowerly and yet it is more sophisticated then most light fragrances. Still, I wish it would last longer and when first applied, there is a slight smell of alcohol. ",3
"i really like this gloss. its not as sticky as the lancome juicy tubes, so it feels really nice on my lips. the color lasts me awhile even though i tend to rub my lips together a lot. plus, it smells really nice. i got this gloss in combustible, and its a really nice berry shade that brightens up my face. the picture shows the gloss about an hour after my application. ",0
I really like this. I love to buy sets because you can mix and match/ Suprisingly for lip gloss it last for some time not hours but it stay on. Yes the colors are not bold but lip gloss is like that. If you what to be bold and stand out get lipstick. I am more of a lipgloss gal so I like this. ,0
"I really like this. It tastes great and has a better texture than many more obvious brands. But PLEASE make it in a tube. Maybe a tube is not that much more hygenic, I don't know -- but it FEELS much more hygenic. So please make this in a tube, then it will be five-star perfect!!!! ",3
I really like this kit... the eyeshadow colors are beautiful and neutral... very nice for daytime... same with the lip colors... very pretty and rich... the black violet eye pencil stays on well... Laura Mercier eyeshadows and lip colors are of great quality and it's so handy to have all this in one compact... I hope she comes out with another toolbox in different colors. ,3
I really like this line from L'Occitane. The smell is just to die for... if you like to smell super sweet with a dash of citrus. This is a super foamy gel that cleanses but doesn't strip your skin and leaves it smelling delightful! ,1
I really like this lipgloss. Color lasts and it is not tacky or sticky. It smells nice with a mild tingly sensation. Colors are universal. I can wear these without difficultly matching my dark african american skin.,2
"I really like this lip stain. It does just what it says on the box, which is give you a flush of colour on your cheeks and lips - in a colour that's just right for you. I do agree with some of these reviews in that it is very drying - but only if you have dry lips to begin with. When my lips are chapped and I put this on it does gravitate to the driest parts of my lips and sort of sticks there - so I look like I do when I've had a couple of glasses of wine - it's that yucky sort of stain. But the way I use it is on the way to work I apply some of that awesome Lush lip balm on my lips so that when I get to work my lips are nice and soft. Then I put some of the lip stain on and voila! Healthy, rosy lips for hours! ",0
"I really like this mascara! The thing I like the most about it is that it gives you great volume, just like it advertises, and at the same time does not make your eyelashes hard and does not clump. When I take it off with eye-makeup remover, I don't lose eyelashes! I am a big fan of this mascara.",0
"I really like this powder. I use it to freshen-up my face midday. I like the fact that the compact has a sponge and mirror. It's great. My only reservation is the compact is made of a material that doesn't hold-up well, but the product is very nice!",4
"I really like this primer. I use it daily before lipstick. I switched from Philosophy's lip primer, because the DuWop is more invigorating and lasts longer. I highly recommend this primer. It also makes my lips feel moist if I decide not to wear a lipstick. ",3
"I really like this procduct. I've used threee or four other high end primers and have never found one where you got as much product for the money. This goes on as a moistuizing,lightweight and fast absorbing undercoat. You don't have to sit around and wait for it to dry. Try it!! ",4
"I really like this product, and I have used it for a the past two years. I rub a small amount in my hands and smooth is over dry hair to control frizzies and flyaways. I leaves my hair shiny and smooth, even in humid weather. ",3
"I really like this product and noticed a difference after the first use. I've been using it for about two months now and my skin is much improved - it's smoother, brighter, the age spots I had are much lighter. I highly recommend it. Plus, it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin like other peels have done. ",2
I really like this product for the summer. It evens out you skin tone for a nice flawless look. Just add a little blush and you are ready to go. It is not as messy as Bare Minerals. It is a little drying for the winter unless you have an oily complexsion ,4
"I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE OILY SKIN AND IT WORKS GREAT, ITS A VERY LIGHTWEIGHT GEL LIKE CONSISTENCY. I HAVENT HAD ANY BREAKOUTS DUE TO THIS. IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN I DONT RECOMMEND, BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOUR DRY ( RULE OF THUMB) YOU SHOULDNT USE OIL-FREE. ",1
"I really like this product! It is lightweight and does not make your hair greasy at all. I have lots of hair that is fine. Even after using it a couple days in a row without washing it, I do not find that my hair is greasy. ",2
I really like this product. It really sticks to your lips which means I don't have to reapply often. The only thing thats not perfect with it is that I think it's really sticky. I have a few of the colors and love them all. It doesn't have a bad taste either! ,0
"I really like this product. It removes my mascara and shadow easily. The one small issue is my eyeliner is sometimes a bit stubborn and takes a bit of effort to remove, but I've found that with all the remover products I've tried, so I can't really fault this one. This remover doesn't sting my eyes like some I've tried or feel greasy at all. So, definitely recommended. ",3
"I really like this product. It's great as a mid-day refresher, or after cleansing as a toner. I can see a definite increase in my skin's radiance. I'm not terribly fond of the smell, but it disapates fairly quickly. I would definately buy this product again.",1
"I really like this set. I was a little unsure about the red in the kit, but all the colors are beautiful. It is really versatile. You can wear the colors lightly for a more natural look or you can really kick it up, especially with the red. The theme is really cute as well. ",1
I really like this sharpener because it's inexpensive and has nice features. The shavings are kept inside until you're ready to empty it out and there are caps to close off the holes the pencils go into. It's easier to keep in my makeup bag since it's less messy and fits small and fat pencils. ,1
"I REALLY LIKE THIS SOAP, IVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 4-5 MONTHS NOW, WHEN U GET OUT OF THE SHOWER IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL BABY SOFT AND ITS GENTLE ENOUGH FOR YOUR FACE. I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND I CANNOT USE EVERYONES' SOAP PRODUCT SO I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.",2
"I really like to use this for special occasions -- it is like wearing false eyelashes without as much fuss. HOWEVER, I did notice that with everyday use, it dries my lashes out and they tend to break easier. So. . . it became my ""special occasion"" secret. ",2
"I really like using this powder. It gives you minor to major coverage based on your application method and lasts all day. It also aids in less break outs, and blends well with other products. I think it is definitely worth the price. The bronzer is also a nice product.",1
I really love the bronzer. I find that it stays on very well and it really looks natural. I like the fact that it is not shimmery at all. I highly recommend this one. It is also great to keep in your makeup case in your handbag. ,1
I really love the color (chestnut) on my fair colored lashes. It definitely lives up to its name and reputation. I do find the applicator brush to be a little big. It can be a bit cumbersome to use. but I will continue to use this product. ,3
I really love the colors in this kit. All of the blues are workable and don't have that 50's-60's look. The highlight color leaves a soft shimmer and the bronze and copper shades are gorgeous. Colors last so the pigment is pretty rich. The darkest blue has a glitter so it is great for evenings. ,4
"I really love the entire line. It provides complete coverage with a very natural glow. I have gotten rid of all of my liquid foundation, which always tended to look cake-y on my middle-aged skin. The translucent coverage of the Bare Escentuals products is just amazing!",4
I really love the feel of this lipstick (like a gloss without the gooey feel). Goes on soft and smooth. The only thing that could improve this product to 5 stars is to make it last just a touch longer. Otherwise its PERFECT. ,2
I really love this cleanser. I discovered while staying at a W Hotel and have been using every since. I refill the little bottle I got from the hotel for use while traveling. My best friend has just recently started using and loves it as well. Makes cleansing an easy one step process. ,2
"I really love this cleanser. My skin always feels extra soft and it dries out my T-Zone very nicely. The only thing is that I wish it kept my oil down for a bit longer. I notice that after about an hour, all the oil is already back. But it has improved the condition of my skin and I really love the smell.",0
"I really love this eye cream, it works well for am before you put on your make up or at night before bed. It's not too heavy and I've noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes after about 2 weeks use ",2
"I really love this eyeshadow, i just recently bought the honey colour. the cases are cute and fun to whip out in a club bathroom because everyone always buzzes about it, but what i love most of all is the eyeshadow itself, which is really thick and velvety, and the colour is intense. ",0
"I really love this kit and it has converted me to smashbox. I was already a fan of the photo finish primer, but I think this kit gives you a better chance to sample some of the most popular products smashbox offers. You get a full size o-blush and eyeshadow and a really good size of all the other products. And I think that they can work on most everyone, so it's really worth checking out. ",0
"I really love this makeup. I have dry, sensitive skin and most make-up either makes my face appear more dry or it burns. This does neither. I mix it with the Candlelight ""foundation,"" which gives my face a nice ""glow"" without making it glittery. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a good foundation for dry skin that provides great coverage. ",2
"I really love this makeup kit, it is so natural appearing, wonderful coverage. I want to buy larger amounts of the stuff in future. I really love the tinted moisturizer, it has amazing coverage. Also the peachy cover creme hides my dark circles very well. It is amazing! ",4
"I really love this product. It provides a luminous glow to the skin, and is a powder, foundation and sunscreen rolled into one. It stays on well, even in the heat of summer. However, it's easy to go overboard with too much on the brush, and it takes practice to get the right amount of coverage. Speaking of coverage, I still use a concealer for dark circles and breakouts under this foundation - it doesn't do much to hide either of these.",1
"I really love this product. It's really handy (haha pun intended) as its nice and sleek and can fit in even a really small purse or a totally packed makeup drawer. Plus the brush applicator is really precise, which means it's not messy at all, and the cuticle oil really works! ",0
"I really love this skin cleanser set, because it polishes your skin to look renewed and really evens out the skin tone. I love how great my skin looks after using because it comes really clean and hydrated. ",1
"I really love this stuff. I have it in Amber (which I am totally in love with) and Dolly (which also looks great). These leave my lips soft, healthy and happy even after they have worn off... which usually takes quite a while to do! They come in second place to Lip Fusion for me, but they do have some serious plumping power, are non-sticky, great shine, and have really pretty sheer colors. My one word of advice would be to not lick your lips or eat for a little while after putting on the gloss as this stuff is a bit spicy and will make your tongue and mouth tingle. :-)",1
I really love this stuff. It curls my hair like nothing else has. The downside is it lasts two weeks nad for the price I just cant see spending the money. If they made a bigger bottle I would give it 5 stars ,1
"I really never knew why my skin was itchy everytime I'd put my foundation on... until I switched to a super soft synthetic brush. The natural bristles leave tiny tears in the skin and thus, the itchiness. I'll never use a natural brush again.",1
"I really only disliked one color out of this palette. The sparkles in the glittery shadows tend to go everywhere, but it's tolerable (just use a cream base first). This palette is more for evening wear than for daytime. ",1
"I really, really wanted to like Bare Minerals. I have oily skin, but i don't have sensitive skin. I can usually put anything on my face without breaking out. My first use of Bare Minerals gave me cystic acne along my jawline. I stopped using it and tried again a week later; same cystic acne along my jawline. ",2
I really wanted this product to work for me and was so disappointed after several tries that it just did not cover my acne/blemishes and did not look natural or stay on all day on my oily skin. This product is overrated and way over priced. ,2
"I really wanted this to be worth it--it's VERY EXPENSIVE!. But, I really can't endorse it. I purchased this before Christmas and used it faithfully three times a week for five months--whew. It took 20-30 minutes each session and my legs never felt stubble-free. The hair did regrow more slowly after regular usage, but now after three months of not using it the hair is just the same. It's easier and less onerously time-consuming to shave every day. The blades only last 4-5 sessions and are quite expensive as well. I am sorry I spent the money. ",3
"I really wanted to love this, but it became too 'spackly' looking after an hour or so of wear. I tried it with the Smashbox foundation primer, and the Water Canvas primer, but it just didn't work for me. ",2
"I really wanted to love this dryer. While it does cut your blow drying time in half I found it made my hair fluffy and almost to silky to hold a decent syle no matter what I tried. The dryer some how changes the texture of your hair, I was a puffy mess in some places and flat in others. ",2
"I really wanted to love this. I recently decided to start curling my eyelashes, and this eyelash curler looked so much less scary than the other ones, but I could not for the life of me get it to curl my lashes. My lashes would either be uncurled, or they would be bent. That might have been ok if I could have bent them at the lashline since my lashes basically go straight down anyway, but it was so frustrating because I couldn't get the curler to my lashline without pinching either corner of my eyelids! I was really disappointed. ",0
"i really wish smashbox would sell just the pallette with the brow tech and cream shadows, i love it so much and i know i'll be incredibly sad when it is gone :( the gl!oss is great and so is the primer, they are packaged in sizes perfect for stucking in your pocket or purse ",0
"I receive compliments all the time and people want to know what fragrance I'm wearing. Nice light, clean scent. I have allergies to heavy perfumes, so I love this scent! I also love the service and selection at Sephora, both the stores and online. ",4
"I received a deluxe sample of this from Sephora for my birthday, and now it's the only Philosophy body wash scent that I buy. The vanilla scent isn't cloying, and my skin holds the scent just a bit throughout the day.",1
"I received a free sample of this product with my package and LOVED it so i bought the full size and it was a diaster! i dont know if i got a bad batch, but all the mascara would come out when i pulled the wand out but the sample size worked perfectly which is why i rated it a 4. I haven't been able to use the full size because it simply doesnt work but i do love the mascara and recommend it. ",0
"I received a sample at Sephora one day and have never used another brand since. It stays on, yet is so simple to remove when you want to. In fact, because I'm not buying mascara remover, it saves me money and best of all, my short stubby lashes are now so long and full! A bonus I never counted on. I can't say enough about Kiss Me Mascara.",4
I received a sample from Sephora.com and when I used this I realized immediately that this is what my salon uses for facials. The smell is heavenly and even though it's expensive you only need a drop to wash your face so it lasts forever. I am picky about the things I spend a lot of money on and this is one great product. I think it's better for dry to normal skin - would not do much if you had oily skin.,3
I received a sample of the product and liked it so I thought I would give it a try and ordered it online. The jar has a very small opening and you have to get the product out with a little plastic spoon. Very wasteful and hard to get cream out. Works Ok but will not buy again because of the jar. ,4
"I received a sample of this and fell in love with it! I have been wearing this scent for about a year and always get compliments on how I smell! A lot of these reviews say this is only good for teenagers, but I think it is a great scent for adults too. It makes you smell fresh and sweet and not like a musty old woman.",2
"I received a sample of this at Sephora a few months ago. I fell in love with the delicious guava smell, and was won over by how soft it left my skin. Clearly, natural products are better! I adore this. ",0
I received a sample of this in black and it's wonderful! Very creamy and goes on easily. I used as an everyday black eyeliner for the past 4 months and still have a lot of product. I will buy this again as soon as I run out..which I don't think will be any time soon! ,0
"I received a sample of this Korres night cream, and liked it well enough to spring for a jar. I am not certain that it firms and restructures, but I found that it is very emollient (I would restrict use to those with dryer skin) and works well over prescription Renova (because I use retinol, I wanted a moisturizer without additional additives, such as AHAs). I also like that it does not have a greasy finish, unlike many nightcreams for dryer skin. ",3
"I received a sample of this mascara the last time I was at Sephora and I love it! I have tried Dior, Bare Escentuals, Laura Geller, plus all of the drug store brands and this one is my favorite. It not only builds volume, lengthens beautifully, doesn't smudge or wear off AND washes off nicely. Will definitely buy the full size. ",3
I received a sample of this mascara with one of my Sephora orders and fell in love the very first time I used it. It is the perfect mascara - makes it look as if you're wearing false eyelashes - without all of the work. ,1
"I received a sample of this product at a Sephora store when I had short hair (gotta love that Beauty Insiders program!) and it works GREAT to add definition and shine to shorter hair and layers. It smells AMAZING too - like sweet almond! Make sure to just use a dab, though, or hair will look too greasy. A great product! ",1
"I received a sample size of this beauty elixir and it has quickly become a MUST HAVE for me! My skin feels refreshed and renewed when I spray it on every morning. Plus, the travel size is a great refresher for your skin mid-day.",1
"I received a sample, tried it, and signed on immediately to order it! Yes, the solution drips - simply use a kleenex and dab it off. Yes, the pads are big and may be a bit clumsy to use - simply take your time and they'll go on just fine. I actually like the large pad because I loved the additional coverage. You definitely didn'thave to pick and choose what area you wanted to concentrate on - it was big enough to cover it all. My eyes looked bright, and dare I say I noticed a HUGE difference in the fine lines around my eyes. I've never used a product that plumped them like this. Definitely a reduction there! I highly recommend this product!! ",3
"I received a sample with one of my Sephora purchases and I am SO glad I opted for it. I have fine, colored hair and have stopped perming. I longed for the 'height' and have tried many other products. I have received many compliments on how soft my hair looks and yet I have the fullness I want. I bought 4 more bottles! ",3
I received some Bobbi Brown Shimmer Ink gel liner in a gift set last year and was looking for something similar -- this Stila smudge pot kit is a great value. I've been mostly using the bronze color - goes on very smoothly - smudges well (much more easy than a liquid or pencil liner) but most importantly it stays on all day and well into the night and overnight if you don't take it off. Love it - reccommend it! ,4
"I received the sample and loved it--bought the full-size and to my disappointment my face kept trying to break out! For some reason (it made my skin look so even, soft and smooth!) after I used it several days--my skin settled down and I have had no problems whatsoever--and a LOT of compliments. This is so easy to use (I just rub it on after my Smashbox primer) I realized I had found MY ""foundation"". Light coverage--no ""made up"" look. ",2
"I received the Serenity shade as an insider exclusive offer and will definitely be reordering it as a result. I have fairly light skin and blue eyes and always use gold tones. I have millions of the same dull shades, but this is the absolute best. It is subtle but yet glittery and glamorous and I absolutely love it. It is infinitely better than any other shade. ",0
"I received this as a bonus gift and ordered twice more so I could have quite a few little lipsticks and than broke down and ordered a full size. Long staying power,but leaves my lips kissably soft.Thanks sephora ",2
"I received this as a Christmas present, and boy am I more than happy with it. Not only is it pink (my absolute favorite color!) but it comes with a mat to rest it on when you're styling, two hair clips to help you section your hair when styling, a helpful DVD, and a carrying case. The iron itself is a must have. My hair came out silky smooth and straight in just minutes! I've had experience with cheaper straighteners you get from drug stores, they would always take me like an hour to straighten my hair. This one saves me a ton of time and makes my hair silky and smooth! It creates waves effortlessly as well. This is a must have. ",0
"I received this as a ""deluxe"" samplle. I wasn't initially too interested, as I assumed it was some sort of ""white"" mineral powder/color. Not so! This product has a wonderful consistency, glides on effortlessly, smoothes out, and truly does seem to make those lines fade away. It certainly doesn't accentuate them as other powders often do. I also found the product to be very forgiving to a rather sloppy self-application. ",3
"I received this as a free sample and I love the taste and scent of both items! The A.M formula is as it should be, refreshing! P.M. is absolutely relaxing right before bed! It is on my must-haves list! ",2
"I received this as a gift for Christmas, and I love it, the colors are pretty (purple is my favorite) and the packaging is super cute! I love it on my dresser, it's so pretty, it makes me feel nostalgic of my ballerina days ",0
"I received this as a sample and loved it. i have normal/combination skin with large pores around my nose area. This gel made my skin flawless, evened out the tone and moisturized, not to the point of being oily but just a dewy look. I do have some acne scars around my chin area so i used Bare Escentual mineral foundation only in those areas where i needed a little more coverage. Then just applied a translucent loose powder over my whole face and voila. My skin was perfeckt!!! The only downside is this procuct is expensive for 1 oz. I don't think i would use it daily, just because i couldn't afford it. ",3
I received this as a sample. I cannot tell you how great my complexion looks with High Beam. I look younger than my age with this product. I bought this immediately in Las Vegas and heads turned in the casinos.,3
"I received this body wash 5 days ago. It has the loveliest light scent of Vanilla and Coconut. A little goes a long way. Makes my skin feel clean, soft (even the dry patches) and leaves just a hint of the lovely fragrance. Can use any perfume with this fantastic body wash. My husband is in love with this fragrance also! Winner!! ",3
"I received this fragrance as a birthday gift from my aunt and I instantly fell in love with the light, and FRESH smell. I am so grateful to her for buying this because I will be using this perfume for the rest of my life. ",0
"I received this fragrance as a gift. the packaging is adorable, though a little impractical to carry in a purse [it's meant to look cute on a dressing table, etc.] the first initial spray was VERY strong. the scent is difficult to describe. it smelled a bit like some kind of industrial strength, berry pineapple-y deodorizing cleanser. I found that the scent DID linger; the dry-down turned to a weird, smoky 'grey' kind of smell- a bit like burnt leaves. if you love this scent, sorry- it obviously didn't work on my skin. [very cute bottle, though.] maybe some of the other scents in this line are more agreeable. ",2
"I received this fragrance as a sample at first and bought it a few times since. However, I switched to another fragrance since this one is a little too young for me. My 16 yr. old sister loves it. It is best suited for teens.",1
"I received this product and was absolutley stunned at the beautiful rosy pink color! This formula of lipstick is my favorite, so I was extremely happy to see it offered for BCA month. Its a gorgeous lipstick for such a wonderful cause...Get it while you can! ",1
I received this product as a sample and loved it so much that I bought a full-size bottle. It cleans my skin better than any other product I have ever used. It is also gentle on the skin. I highly recommend it. ,3
I received this product as one of my samples with my order. I am so glad I did. I love the color and feel of this blush and have received many compliments on how it looks. I have made the switch Blu_Ray. ,3
"I recently bought a breath freshener, I had my reservations at first. The product is supposed to maintain ph balance in your mouth. It also contains antioxidants. The taste is good, different, but I like it. If I use it at bedtime, my breath is still good in the morning. If I am going to talking with someone, I give it one squirt of Elixir and I am confident. It really is a genious invention. The price seems a little high, but to me, it's worth it. Thanks to the inventor's of this one! ",2
"I recently bought the 10 pack of mascara samplers by Sephora and systematically went through it twice, wearing a different mascara each day for 20 days so I could compare. This was one of my two favorites. It goes on very easily and quickly lengthens and thickens with no clumping. It is a wonderfully smooth and natural formula. ",2
"I recently bought the 10 pack of mascara samplers by Sephora and systematically went through it twice, wearing a different mascara each day for 20 days so I could compare. This was one of my two favorites. The thing I liked best about this is that it STAYS PUT! I seem to have trouble with mascaras because I am a drummer, and I squint my eyes tightly when I'm jamming. Most mascaras and eyeliners tend to run leaving either big or slight raccoon eyes underneath. (Yes, even waterproof and smudgeproof) This didn't! Yay! It's consequently a little hard to remove, but worth it to me ",2
I recently bought Viridiana and it's amazing. This is my first Nars lipstick purchase and it definitely won't be the last. It's a long wearing lipstick that doesn't bother my lips while giving alot of bold color.,1
"I recently purchased Nars blush in Exhibit A. When you acutally see this shade, it is neon orangey red. It is a bit clownish to see in the compact, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it, so I took a chance and bought it. It is a lovely sheer version of the compact shade on the skin. It wakes up my face with one little stroke and lasts into the evening. I feel awake and fresh when I wear this shade. My advice is to look at the brighter shades and imagine them as a color wash on your skin. Take a chance and go bold..Also, the blush lasts a lot longer when you don't need as much.",2
"I recently purchased this collection and am very pleased. I have blue eyes, so greys are perfect for me. This has everything I need, highlight, lid color, and accent color. Stila makes an excellent eyeshadow, and the magnetic container is the best. A winner!!! ",4
"I recently purchased this eye primer at my local Sephora store. I've used Laura Geller's primer for quite some time, but recently found that it felt too thick. I checked out the Urban Decay primer and the BE primer at the store. I really liked the BE primer best. It felt light and smooth when applied. I apply it at the center of my eye with my finger and spread it out from there. Be patient when you prime the applicator otherwise you will have a lot more coming out than you need. Try this primer ladies. My colors stay true and last. ",3
"I recently purchased this kit because of the price. When I received it, I could not wait to try it. I love these products. It does not feel like I have makeup on. The coverage is fantastic and comparable to my other makeup. Once I have finished using my old product I plan to switch over. ",3
"I recently purchased this polish in Metro Chic and I adore it! It stayed on without chipping for two weeks and everyone was asking for the name of it. If you're looking for a new fall color to rock but are unsure of all the deep hues, this cool grey tone is a great way to go. ",0
I recently purchased this product to see if i liked the brand or not. The first day i wore it as i was getting into the car my husband noted that my face looked like it was glowing. he said it was very smooth and wanted to know what i did? I told him it was my little secret.,0
"I recently realized I was stuck in the 90's (or maybe 80's) as far as my makeup routine goes. My idea of eyeliner was to line the inner rim of both upper and lower lids with a thin pencil. When I decided to change my routine and tried to line the upper (outer) lash lines, I had no luck with liquid eyeliners and the thin eye pencils did not look great with my application. I had some success with fat eye pencils, but since discovering this cake eyeliner, I'm hooked. I bought a smudge brush and this looked perfect on the very first try. I have the Chocolate/Blueberry and plan on getting the Key Lime/Green Apple soon. ",2
"I recently started wearing NARS blush, in color Desire. I made the switch from my typical go-to MAC creme blush and was a bit hesitant, but I am so glad I did! The blush lasts all day, goes on super sheer, and is the perfect tint to go along with my red lips. ;) I will definitely buy again",0
"I recently took a week-long business trip. I took only this palette for eyes and cheek. Even a product junkie like me was satisfied, and never found myself wishing I had brought more. Bleary eyed at 5 am I could get a great look for a breakfast meeting and also a more glam look for an evening business dinner. All from this little blendable palette. It's really great quality too. This has easily become my favorite powders too. ",4
I recently tried this product and love it! It is a must have for all hair types! Just apply and dry!!! My hair did awesome with this product. I have tried the trial size and will buy the full size soon! ,1
"I recent;y purchased the Nars' blush in orgas.m and outlaw. I haven't received outlaw yet, but i've seen it in stores. I absolutely LOVE all of nars blushes, they're so light with the perfect amount of shimmer and so creamy when applying. All the colours are beautiful and fits perfectly with my skin tone. I'm a little hesitant using colour on my cheeks because of my sensitive skin, but with nars blushes, I go crazy!",0
"I recieved this as a sample and immediately went back and bought the full size version, it takes away stubborn eye makeup even the tough waterproof stuff. The only drawback is that it has an oily afterfeel.",2
"I recieved this set as a gift. I love it so much! Not only does both fragrances smell awesome, but it is travel friendly (hench the product name). I have one in my purse and one in my desk at work. I never leave home without it! ",0
"I recommend this to anyone that misses that shimmer in their hair we had when we were kids. I color treat my hair and I also glaze it from time to time,but this product does no damage and prolonges that shine I miss. ",3
I recommend this to anyone who suffers from oily hair as I do. I don't want to wash everyday because I have color treated hair and I try to treat it kindly.Using this dry shampoo helps it to look good and smell good a little goes a long way. Oscar Blandi has wonderful products. ,3
"I regret ordering this on line. Had I seen the color I probably would have made a different color choice. But surprises occasionally work out, and this is in my current line-up. While it goes on smoothly, it looks and feels a bit dry. So I am currently using a clear gloss overcoat with it. ",4
"I remember this was the first item i purcased at sephora when i was 16.So why not start a review first with this one.Well the lady from sephora tried it on me,and it tingled and kinda smelled like bubblegum at the same time.It kinda hurted since it was my first lip plumper to try on.I saw the results and they were great!i made my mom buy it lols.It is a nice lip plumper and a great price for it too.I recommend!=) -makeupjunki3!! ",0
"I remember when I first started wearing make-up & had so much fun experimenting with colors. This is reminiscent of those times. I loved the rich color & sparkle in the store & thought, ""why not?"". Its perfect for a night out with the girls. ",2
"I resisted trying this for so long. I'd had a bad experience with a spray-on foundation primer and thought they'd all be as drying. I finally tried this in a sample though, and it""s my it's a must-have product. My makeup looks so much better with it.",1
I returned this. I didn't care for the proportions and it is really just a glorified makeup bag. The sequins were not going to stand up to being used as an everyday makeup bag and I have other evening bags I far prefer. I didn't even consider keeping it for one of my teenage daughters. ,3
"I returned this product after using for 6 weeks. I didn't see any new hair growth (even the invisible hairs the Anastasia rep said to look for first)! As a member of the generation who as teenagers plucked our brows to death (along with tanning ourselves to a crisp), I was hoping for some visible results, but this product didn't turn out to be worth the price. ",3
"I REVIEWED THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR SITE AND, AT FIRST, THOUGHT THAT'S QUITE A BIT OF MONEY, BUT IF IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS...... UPON TRYING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WAS AMAZED. PURE SILK ON YOUR SKIN. IT IS SO LIGHT, SMOOTH, WITH A NICE SPLASH OF COLOR. THIS PRODUCT TOTALLY HIDES YOUR PORES AND MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO SILKY. IT HAS BECOME A ""MUST"" IN MY DAILY ROUTINE. THANK YOU DR. BRANDT!",4
"I rushed to my local Sephora store last week to get this, since it's sold out online. I've been using it non-stop since. It's a great idea and quite simple actually. It's portable and no fuss. And yes, it is refillable. Also, to clean the brush you probably have to dump out all the contents to wash, and then let it dry overnight before refilling it again. Great product. ",0
"I saw this duo in a Sephora catalog and thought it looked great on the model. It was a total waste of money. The highlighter is nice, but the cream shadow/liner is terrible. It's way too dark once you manage to get it on, and way too dry. ",2
"I saw this last time at the store when I went to get the lip injection (which I love). I decided to go for it and but the kit this weekend. I tried it out the first day and was torn. I LOVE the colors but could not seem to make it look decent. The day smokey eye is nice but similar to what I do to my eyes now. The other one I wanted to try was the Classic. I love the way it turned out but wasn't crazy about the silver. So now I use the sugar cookie instead of the silver. It looks much better, The rocker smokey eye I avoid completely because it gives a racoon look. The kit itself is nice and I like the angled brushes. It could use a mirror though. ",0
I seldom buy the same fragrance more then twice. Lovely is one I continue to purchase again and again. This fragrance does not walk in the room ahead of you. Only those closest to you will notice it. Once they notice they always ask and mention how wonderful this scent is. ,4
"I sent this to my daughter and granddaughter as a gift. They live in the ""frozen"" north and I thought they would like some pampering. They love the fragrance and the way it leaves your skin so smooth and moist. Light ginger scent but mostly clean smelling. ",4
I should have asked for my money back on this one but couldn't be bothered. I gave it to my niece to see if it worked for her. Left my skin sticky and I started breaking out the very next day. Just awful. ,2
"I simply adore my Sephora lip gloss pencils! At first, I couldn't imagine how a gloss could be applied as a pencil, but I was thrilled the first time I tried it. I own two colors and would love to buy a ton more, but there aren't enough colors I can wear. Please, Sephora, expand the color choices so I can start a collection! :) ",3
"Is NOT a stain! Looks beautiful as a mascara. The only mascara that I've found that can color my bottom lashes without ending up in circles. Must remove at night! Woke up with stuck together lashes worse than my other mascaras, so unless you don't sleep for all four days, don't know how this can last that long. ",3
"Is one of the most flattering colors I have worn on my cheeks: Peachy pink with a tiny hint of shimmer. This is definitely a ""must have"" product, though I would probably prefer the Nars duo with the coordinating bronzer. Either way, this is a great product and it is no shock it is a ""Best of Sephora"" item.",1
"I splurged when I bought this product. I use LipFusion XL before I go to bed at night. I find that I can use any other lip color or lip gloss during the day and my lips a hydrated and they stay plumped up over the course of the next day. I also find that with regular use I don't use as much lip balm during the day. It's definitely worth the money. You may find that it tingles when you first start using it, but with regular use, I've found that my lips no longer ""tingle"" they just look and feel plumped and full. ",2
"I spray 2 spritzes in my hands, rub them together, and gloss over my hair to prep for flat ironing. It definitely makes the process go more smoothly, and leaves hair very shiny without weighing it down. ",0
"I started just lining my lips but now use this pencil all over my lips. I just turned 60 and have lines on my lips and this product fills them in so the lipstick goes on smoother. You can use it above you lips so your lipstick doesn't feather, but thats not a problem for me. I'll be buying another one of these on my next trip to keep in my work bag. ",4
"I started using all the Bare Minerals products a year back. After using it for over one month my 72 year old husband asked what I did to my face. I said ""WHAT"" he said my skin looked smoother and younger. He noticed??? that was something. Now all three daughters are using it.\nMineral Veil is the icing on the cake it just finishes the entire process.",4
"I started using primer after receiving a sample of Perricone MD. It was absolutely fantastic, but the full size bottle is out of my budget. This Smashbox primer is a good alternative. It certainly makes my foundation (Bare Minerals) go on smoother and last longer. And it doesn't irritate my skin or make me break out. If you can spend an extra $36 every couple months, I'd say it's worth it. I use it everyday and it does make a difference.",1
I started using this product 5 years ago when I had an undiagnosed skin alergy and was eliminating possible irritants. Two pumps covers my entire face and I've had no breakouts. It absorbs quickly and the tint blends age spots and acne scars well. I even wear it while playing tennis and I haven't suffered a sunburn. Color will transfer if you perspire. ,3
"I started using this product about 2 years ago. I switched over from a liquid foundation. I have ""mature"" skin and I love the polished look/finish that this gives. It works best when the ""Present"", also by Philosophy, is used as a base. The finish stays all day. ",4
"I started using this product about ten years ago. I had tried other products before, nothing worked this well. I have very sensitive skin and the wax does not irrate it.I had no desire to go to a salon and be embarrassed.With this wax I can easily have smooth skin anywhere on my body I want to. ",3
"I started using this product at work a few days ago, and it does in fact work great for my skin. My make-up doesn't smear and I feel a bit more comfortable. Recommended for those who have cubicles or tiny office spaces.",1
"I started using this when I bought the Clarisonic Skin Care Brush. Since the brush is actually a little too rough for my sensitive skin, I've continued to use this cleanser on the days I don't use the brush. It's very gentle and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight. ",3
"I start every morning using this luxurious, fresh soap. No surprise that it is manufactured by a company with the name of Fresh. Once I tried this soap a few years back....I simply couldn't use anything else. I even leave the surrounding paper in my linen closet, so....that when I am passing down the hall I can smell the scent.\n\nI simply love, love, love the clean, fresh, citrus smell! It is definitely a keeper, and one to try!",4
"is there anything Sephora doesn't do well? the answer is NO! a great shadow for the price point. concentrated, good pigmentation, blends like a dream, good choice of colors. can also be used wet, which is the mark of a good shadow. nice! ",2
"Is this mascara. Diorshow gets all the glory and secretly, while I love Diorshow, I often reach for this one first. The key is layering this UNDER your Diorshow for an even more dramatic Diorshow effect. This is a bit more defining and grabs every single lash! ",1
"I stuck them in the fridge to get that extra chill on- although they felt nice and cooling I didn't notice any kind of reduction in puffs/ fine lines, etc. Product does start to drip- just tissue it off. They did feel good temporarily but I'm skeptical as to what they actually did. won't be buying these again. ",1
"I stumbled on this product many years ago after having my hair fried during a bad bleaching process. It literally saved my hair from breaking off. I stil use it even though my hair is no longer bleached. It doesn't weigh hair down at all. It also leaves hair soft, but not so soft you can't do anything with it. It also makes hair super shiny. ",3
"I swear by this body scrub. It leaves your skin smoothe, beautiful, soft, and so radiant. I've had a problem all my life with my underarms being rough and slightly discolored (because of my skin color). This scrub is the first product I've tried where it evened my skin tone and color out. It smells so fresh and is a must have for anyone who is planning on doing a spray on tan. It makes any blotchy skin disappear and just smoothes everything out.",0
"I swear by this product for overnight pimple zapping. I've been using this for years now and it still works like a charm. If oily skin is your problem, this works great at creating that matte feel/look. If you have dry skin on the other hand then spot treatment would be better. ",0
"it burns your lids a bit, and although it lasts, it will be removed when the chemical odor causes your eyes to tear up, I usually use a qtip to help with it, but quit using it all together because it just took too long to put on with the tearing up and all. ",0
"It did lengthen, but my lashes stick together when I use this, so instead of looking like I have full lashes, I end up looking like I have 5 really thick lashes. It's banished to the bottom of my makeup drawer. ",2
"It does in fact volumize and lengthen, but you must let it dry in between coats. Also I have very straight eyelashes, and it does not curl them at all, like it states. I still need to use an eyelash curler, and an eyelash comb to brush out clumbs. Overall I like the product, but may not continue to purchase it, as it's a little pricey. ",1
it doesnt make you look full of glitter it applies very little at a time. i even blink into the brush so I can get more but the days I dont wanna have glitter lashes I dip a liner brush into the lash brush and apply it as eye liner. I get TONS of compliments when I wear this ,0
"I teach and have 2 dogs, so I'm not always making it out the door on time and need to cut corners where I can. I absolutely love these eye liners. As I'm warming my car up, heating up my tea, I can just quick slide one of these and I'm good to go for the whole day!! I love all the bright fun colors that make it easy to play up different outfits as well as make your eyes POP!",1
"I tend to wash my face a lot since I ride horses and play sports I am either covered in sweat, dirt or both and end up washing my face quite often. This never dries out my skin no matter how many times I was it! Clinique makes great products.",1
"I tested one of the colors of this product on my hand, and had to have it. however, when I got the product home and used it with a lip brush [I didn't want to use my finger] I found that the formula is quite- gooey, is the only word I can use to describe it, making application problematic. it also had an odd scent and taste- kind of like floral-y petroleum jelly. sorry, but the combination of the product's texture and container made this one a miss. Dior has so many other excellent lip products- especially their Addict line- that are gorgeous and a pleasure to wear, so no big deal. ",2
"It gives me breakouts! I previously wrote a review and gave this two thumbs up, but after about a week of wearing this my face went wild and tiny pimples appeared. I chose Torrid which was such a beautiful color, but now I'm on the search for something new. So if you have sensitive skin buyer beware!",1
"it goes on smoothly and stays soft and smooth throughout the day-when I received it, my first thought was it is so dark-but it isn't, just gives you a light glow. i have found that it works great on my eyelids also. If you want it any darker, just add a small amount more. Comes out of bottle much better than the regular primer and does double duty. ",3
"it has a great smell, and the ingredients are great but for me it just made my fine hair look greasy. i love jonathon and other products though so if you are considering it i would try it. all of his other products i have used are great and so ""green"" ",2
I think all the products here are great and super-portable. The concealer is my all-time favorite concealer and high beam was stellar too. I don't wear make-up all the time so the small sizes were perfect for me. ,0
"I think all the superlatives have been used for the Clarisonic Skincare Brush. I have been using this for several months and would not be without it. Good exfoliation, good for stimulating blood flow (thereby promoting healing of any blemishes). I do think each person has to figure out the frequency of brush use. I started out with twice a day and that was too much in the beginning, so went to once a day, then to once every 2 days. I am now back at twice a day after giving my skin a chance to get used to ""being clean."" I don't think it's necessary to use the Clarisonic Daily Cleanser with the brush. Any mild cleanser will do. This is especially nice on the backs of my hands before moisturizing and gloving for the night. ",4
"I think I have tried every single eye makeup remover on the market from the lowest to highest price and this one is the best. A little goes a long way and there's absolutely no ""stinging"" and the best thing is that it conditions your lashes also!",2
"I think I have tried just about every mascara on the market....this one takes the cake! Hands down THE best! I have a ton of lashes, but they are very fine and very straight so most mascaras leave me with nothing but clumps-o-lashes once I try to apply. Diorshow leaves my lashes beautifully fuller and no clumps in sight! Hope once you try it, you feel the same. ",3
"I think that this is the best concealer I have ever used. It masks my dark circles very well, glides on easily and is not drying. Three swipes and a little blending, & I am good to go, works well on blemishes, too! ",2
"I think the complaints about it's lasting power are because they think this is a perfume; it's not a perfume; it's a pick-me up spray. S*x on the Beach is my favorite scent of Demeter's line; it smells like fruity-floral. i use it mostly on the weekends when i don't want to use my expensive, high-end perfumes. ",2
I think there are some technical difficulties with this product. The first one I purchased stopped working after just a few treatments. I exchanged it for another which worked fine for about ten treatments. Now it keeps shutting itself off every 15 seconds. The product is made in Canada and offers no toll free number for technical support. ,3
"I think the stuff is great, but I have oily skin and I immediately broke out like a crater on my left cheek (one big one) after using it sparingly for a couple days and nights. Gave to my mom to see if she is ok with it..I may just return it because it wasn't full at time I bought it but it was online, so nothing to compare it to. Bottle is HUGE, what's inside is DAINTY... ",2
I think this is a great value. Im fair and actually think these shades will work. The only thing missing is masscara...maybe next time. I was surprised at how small it is but I like that the palletes come out so you can use it to store things when your done with the makeup. The music box piece needs some revamping but its cute to look at. Great gift for a glamour girl! ,2
"I think this is an excellent lipstick. It is rich and creamy, highly pigmented and just the right ammount of shimmer. Also, it has NO taste, nothing offensive about it. The colors are great. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it wears off quickly on me. I wore this for my wedding and after a couple kisses, it was gone. I bought Niagra, which looks beautiful on tan skin in the summer. I still think it's a great product, I just have to re-apply often.",2
"I think this is just the best mascara I've ever used! I just need one coat to produce long and full lashes. I don't find it clumpy, but I do comb out my lashes every time as mine are rather thick. No flaking, no smearing, no problems! Just wish it came in brown! ",3
I think this is one of my new favorite scents. The original Bucheron is more sophisticated than this one but Miss Boucheron was one of the best additions to their line of fragrances. I can wear this scent during day or night. It really is a fun and flirty scent. ,1
I think this is probably the best cleanser I have ever used. It feels so silky on your skin and my skin never feels dry or tight afterwards. My face feels very clean and no mascara circles after I rinse it off.,1
"I think this is the best eyeliner I have tried, and I've used many of the big brands. They come in great colors and have good staying power. I have found that it does smear some in the heat, but not badly. It goes on easily and is good for different skin types. Not messy and easy to remove with makeup remover. ",0
"I think this little kit is wonderful@! I just LOVE red lipstick and this kit has a lot of options for different shades of red. Additionally, the lip colours are wonderful as a ""base"" for just about any tube lipstick there is. The talking lesson is a really nice option. ",3
I think this stuff works great. I'm 46 and the backs of my hands get very dry looking when I'm not using this. Be sure to follow the directions and only put a pea sized amount on the back of one hand and rub it in using the back of the other hand. Theres no need to waste it on the palmar surface of your hands ,3
"I thought $18 was a bit much to spend on eye shadow, but I was definitely not disappointed with my 'Rich *itch' eye shadow. I love this stuff, and I could definitely wear it every day. The color goes on nicely, and a little goes a long way. It's the perfect half creamy, half loose powder type texture. I definitely recommend it. ",0
I thought I was buying a terrific high lighter and instead I have not yet managed to get enough of the product on to make a difference. I can see any of the colors on my fair skin. There is a tiny shimmer but not enough to make a difference. Perhaps it is better with darker skin. I hate it when I make such an expensive mistake. ,4
"I thought I would give the makeup case to my daughter as a gift, and I bought this so I could have the 0.5 oz Spackle Under Makeup Primer for when I fly! I can't live without that stuff for a make-up base! But I love the eye spackle and lip spackle as well! I'm still experimenting with the Bronze N Brighten powder. ",4
"I thought I wouldn't like this, and was ready to give away the Beauty Insider deluxe sample. But there are times I WANT to smell this sweet and girly! I put it on right after showering, and LOVED the way I smelled. Not sure I would buy the EDT, but I would consider getting the shower gel. The hair perfume and shower mousse are intriguing, but out of my price range for the amount you get.",4
"I thought I would try the bareMinerals foundation only and wait on the brush. I loved the foundation, BUT THEN I GOT THE KABUKI BRUSH and I swear this is part of the bareMinerals secret!!!!!!!! To get the full effects of bareMineral foundation, not just any brush works, YOU NEED THIS BRUSH!",2
"I thought Pink Sugar would just be a summer scent, but I'm still wearing it and we're getting close to fall! I've received so many compliments...men and women alike. It's not overbearing or too powerful, and it smells so yummy! : )",2
"I thought - Ruby? I'm not a red person. After reading all the great reviews, I went into Sephora and tried out the whole kit in the store just for fun, and I was greatly surprised! The colors are not bright or glittery. The subtle shimmer is nice - I'm 50 and didn't want shimmery like a teenager. These are beautiful, and the eye shadows are to die for. The only ""glittery"" thing is the ruby mascara, but on top of the black it gives your eyes a subtle twinkle. My husband's eyes have a twinkle, too when he saw these on me. ",3
"I thought that foundation primer was one of those unnecessary products that the folks behind the counter just tried to sell you, but I didnt' know what i was missing until i tried this. Really makes my pores invisible, evens out my skin, and helps my make-up last all day, even in the August heat and humidity. The best part is that it dissappears immediately when applied and does not feel like an ""extra layer"" on my face. Feels like nothing, but makes all the difference.",1
"I thought that the colors came out pretty when I used it, and that's the only thing that I like about it. I have it in Violet and Forest Green. However these don't last very long. They smudge or come off easily; they don't even last for 5 minutes. I'm most likely not buying these again. No wonder they're so cheap. ",0
"I thought that this would be a great mascara to try since I love the shu uemura eyelash curler. But just because they make a great curler doesn't mean they make a great mascara. It's just an average mascara, no better than one you could buy at the grocery store. It doesn't really lengthen, or extend, or have good volume. It's just okay. And it doesn't come off very easy either. If you want just an average mascara, then you should love this one. ",2
"I thought this would be great for those on the go touchups since I use the regular pencil kit at home. Talk about a waste. The color wasn't very ""universal"" and I learned too late that I could only use the Anastasia sharpener to sharpen this. I say stick with the original kits and pencils. ",1
it is a good price and it worked like all the other fillers i have tried but as the day goes on i have normal to oily skin so it fades thats why i gave it 3 stars but it is a great buy for the product ,2
"It is a great shampoo that doesn't leave a heavy residue. The smell is very nice, and it makes for a great product for the shower. My hair curled up nicely into ringlets after I used this product. I love it! ",0
It is easy to use and it is amazing how much makeup accumulates on the brush. It is a great idea and helps keep the brushes be more effective and last longer. No more dead brushes due to overload of makeup.,4
"It is funny that Amazing Grace is the most popular fragrance but it is way too ""flowery"" for me. I live in Pure Grace and even use the body wash and lotion. It just smells clean and refreshing and does not trigger my allergies! I've heard that this is the most popular Philosophy fragrance in Europe.",2
"It is hard for me to review this product, because I am still having trouble applying eye liner for the first time. I had tried the pencil on my hand and both the color and the smoothness of the pencil are great. If I could only get myself to apply it correctly to my eyes, I am sure I would give it 5 stars.",1
"It is hard to find the right mascara and before you know it you've bought tube after tube spending quite a bit of money. This sampler has some of the best name brand mascaras that Sephora has to offer. They range from dramatic to natural. I love that I've been able to try a new mascara everyday, and now I know what I am looking for. I hope there are more samplers to come! ",1
"It is non-greasy, and it's non-irritating (I even wear contacts) It removes my waterproof mascara, and I don't have to worry about leaving traces of makeup on my eyes at the end of the day. One complaint would be that the lid is kind of a hassle to remove. I would prefer it to be in a pumping container or something easier.",0
"It is so dry here that we all lip balm all year round. This balm is nice and light and not gloppy, but it is hard to get out of the jar. I would rather have a small jar than a stick,because I am not asked to share. But it does not last as long some other balms I have had do. ",3
It is so hard to find a good deodorant that is not also an anti-persperant but this really does the trick! It has a very clean subltle fragrance and works all day! It is clear and won't stain your clothes but does take a minute to dry.,1
"It is waterproof, stays on all day, wears well and it is just the perfect accent to compliment the eyes. People are always asking me what I use and the best part is they come in to ask if they did their eyes up right. They actuallly want to copy my look! ",4
"It keeps my skin balanced so that it is neither too dry or too oily. It takes all my makeup off so easily and I love how safe it is to use on my skin, as I am very sensitive and am limited in what products I can use.",1
It lasted all night in the heat and I decided to leave it on and see what happened. Woke up still on and road 530 miles on my motorcyle in hot weather and when I arrived at the final destination it was still on.,4
"it leaves hair silky and nio static to deal with .Also gives volume,and does not tagle hair as most round brush do,for i am not too good in using round brush.Retains heat so hair dries fast if you can combine it with a t3 hair dryer. ",4
It looked more brownish on the website but in reality it is a warmer medium reddish-brown color. It's longer lasting than some of the other NARS shades and looks great on olive-skinned brunettes. A good year-round lipstick to wear.,3
"It looks like it will be a little too OTT, with all that glitter, but at least on my fair skin, a little goes a long way. It doesn't go on as glittery as it looks in the compact. I see now why everyone loves the Nars blush. Their eye shadows are favorites of mine, too. ",3
"It may be that I have an allergy to one of the extracts; however, this eye makeup remover definitely caused stinging every time I used it (which I no longer do). It will remove your makeup, but I recommend proceeding with caution if your skin is sensitive. ",4
"It may come off as semi-expensive, but it has a nice misty feel. Feels best during the spring and summer. You'll feel a little relaxed after using it and your skin will feel refreshed. I like using it during the day when my skin starts to feel oily and you don't have time to wash and re-do your make-up.",0
"It must be about 10 yrs ago that I was in Sephora in SF having a ""makeover"" and the artist started putting this white stuff on my lashes. My daughter says ""Why are they making her lashes WHITE?"" Anyway, being of a certain age, my previously long and thick lashes have started to thin. This stuff plumps them right back up. WITHOUT looking clumpy or unnatural. And it doesn't bleed, giving me raccoon eyes. And it doesn't make my lashes fall out, like some other mascaras. I dropped it's rating to a 4 simply because at some point midway through the tube I almost ALWAYS end up with a huge clump of product coming out and have to scrape it off on the edge of the tube and shove it back down. That is a little annoying also worrisome to a degree, as you think about what bacteria or germs you might be shoving down in there. The alternative would be to waste a significant amount of product. Other than that, I love this stuff -- evidenced by my 10+ yr. loyalty! ",4
"It only takes a teensy tiny bit of this to make my hair soft and smooth and shiny for the entire day. It really, really works to protect my hair from the heat of the hairdryer and heaters, etc. It is easy to use too much, in which case my hair does get a little greasy, but it usually balances out within a few hours. ",0
"I too have waited a long time for the right train case to come along. This is homerun. The brown croco looks expensive and stylish. It's fabulous, the color is great and the materials used are top quality. I would recommend this to anyone thinking about getting it. Don't think--just order it, you will not be disappointed. ",3
I took this on a trip to a hot and humid locale and it worked great as a super light moisturizer after i washed my face every night. It's also refreshing during the day and has a light grape-ish smell.,1
"I totally panic when I start to run out. This product does not clog my massive crater pores. It's the right Moisture for my sensitive old skin. YES WE CAN moisturize and not clog up Dear John, THANK YOU!! Love, Stella ",3
"I travel extensively with my job and this palette has been a life saver! I love how it folds up and locks - tons of color choices without taking up a ton of space in my luggage. The lip glosses aren't my favorite, but with this kit, the only other make up i need to pack are a bare minerals foundation, a lip gloss and an eyeliner. packing is much quicker now! ",3
"I travel frequently and this is perfect; compact, doesn't frizz or dry out my hair. It's the best travel dryer, almost the best hairdryer I've used. Because it's lightweight, my arm doesn't tire and the air flow attachment was all that was missing from the earlier versions. ",3
I travel to Las Vegas for business four times a year. It is very dry there and this product was my oasis in the desert. It's incredibly refreshing and smells wonderful. Even my husband liked it. The fragrance is very unisex.,4
"It really does control the oil and minimize your pores. The tube is a little small for what you're paying. You're going to have to buy the product fairly often because you don't get a long-lasting supply. The product feels a bit sticky going on, and is hard to spread across the face, so it takes a bit of getting used to. But it definitely works if you've got oily patches. ",2
"It really does nothing for the orange peel look, but I loved how wonderful it smelled... it would knock me right out at the end of the night in a state of aroma-induced bliss. Come morning, my skin only looked and felt softer and smoother, but no less bumpy. ",0
"It really hasn;t helped; there were no instructions with it; whether to use under or over foundation...it smeared and lokked worse; did not help the fact that my nose is always shiny. I need coverage and shine control, It cakes ",3
It really is! Its light but covers well. And it stays put all day. I spray it on a sponge first and then apply (learned from Carmindy and What Not to Wear). Dab more on if you want more coverage. My only problem is that they never seem to have shade 300! But its well worth the money if you want flawless skin!,2
"I tried every sharpener out there to sharpen my soft waterproof pencils- this is the only one that works without breaking off the eyeliner, or leaving sharp pieces of the wood from the pencil behind. Couldn't do without it. ",4
"I tried it on my hand in the store, not on my lids. Big mistake! I bought the brown and it doesn't really show on my eyes and what you can see wipes right off. I'm returning this product tomorrow, which is a first for me. ",4
"I tried it recently, and really like it. I use a flat taklon liner brush and just ""push"" the mineral powder near the lashline for definition: I don't do a ""line."" I use the product as a powder, although you can wet your brush and use it as a liquid. I debated about color, and tried Tiger Eye. It is a beautiful alternative to brown, with some iridescence/other colors subtly in there. I am medium skinned with dark eyes and brows, but my hair is medium brown with highlights, and I read somewhere that I should use brown liner, not black. They were right! What a warm, lovely difference! The only ""negative"" I could say, is that there is enough mineral in the jar for the rest of my life (if that's a negative...) I wish they sold half as much in a smaller jar, so I could buy a few colors. Find a friend and buy two colors and share... ",3
"I tried Luminous as a Sephora travel size. I wasn't very impressed, especially for the price. While it does even out the surface, it didn't do much to even out my complexion. It was too sheer, even more sheer than tinted moisturizer, which I also can't wear because of lack of coverage. I had originally seen this product as part of one of the 'Get the Look's Sephora has on their site. The model's complexion looked flawless, but she must have already had flawless skin (or they airbrushed) because I didn't get anywhere near those results. ",2
"I tried MUFE Diamond Shadow for the first time for my wedding, and it completely exceeded my expectations. This amazing shadow lasted through 95 degree heat and tears. It seriously DID NOT MOVE. Since then, I have bought several other colors. I recommend this product for blendability, crease resistance, staying power, and overall beautiful finish. ",0
"I tried Nars blush after hearing so much about it on Beauty Blogs. I purchased the ever popular ""*cannot put name of shade as the site calls it ""profanity"" and was an immediate convert. Nars' texture is light and lovely. The range of colors seem to be flattering for almost any skin tone. I am fair complected, and the peachy color of ""the lovely peachy color that infuses your face when you experience involuntary muscle contractions"" looks perfectly natural on me. I am going to probably branch out and try a couple of other shades, soon. However, I've purchased The Multiple stick and the Blush/Bronzer duo in ""Oh, how I wish I was a Multiple-r"" as well as having the regular blush in ""Le Petit Mort"". I probably need to wait a bit before I buy more blush! If this is ever discontinued, I'll stage a protest!",2
"I tried Nars blush cause I ran out of my old one. this has to be the best cream blush around. It goes on really easily and lasts all day. This brand has opened my eyes to all the different possibilities that exist for blush colors.\nGo to Sephora and don't let the Nars blush colors scare you, try em out.",1
"I tried one of the scented body butters and wasn't too thrilled with it, but, this product is much better. It moisterizes great and doesn't have a scent that will go against any perfume. It also comes in a LARGE tub so it is a great value! ",3
"I tried the 24 carats I believe. Its a white shimmer. I am so glad that SEPHORA is selling OPI! This is the only polish I can keep on for about 3 or 4 days.. And I dont work with my hands.. Nothing else stays on. And the lite shades dont look too bad when they begin to wear. This is a deal! Unless you can afford the salon, I cant! ",4
"I tried the gilded stick because I really love the whole benefit line. I love it, first I line my top lid with Bad gal liner, then go above it with gilded and wow, I look like a nap! I put a little under my brow bone and the inside corners of my eyes, a great look! ",3
I tried the glossing shampoo along with the conditioner and glazing and it was just fab. It made my hair feel silky and had a super shine. I would recommend this product to anyone who's looking for this type of results. ,3
I tried the LipLock shade and it was very bright and when it has been on for awhile a ring around the mouth effect is created and it is not very attractive. The clear gloss is thick and does not have a long wearing effect at all. Whatever residue is left on your lips is almost impossible to remove. I know this was created for the Hollywood stars for the award shows but I can't imagine anyone of that caliber settling for this product. ,3
"I tried the Orgasm blush, and it really is amazing. I have had complete strangers complement me on my complexion, and one actually used the the phrase ""peaches and cream"". It gives you such a natural, healthy glow.",1
I tried the sample and liked it so much I went ahead and ordered it. Usually product like this is to heavy for my fine/thinning hair. This stuff makes my hair look much healthier. I put it on towel dried hair before my styling product. It gives a nice shine and a more 'managed' look. ,4
"I tried these in the store, and they were not the right shape for my eye! My eyes are more narrow and not deep-set, and these would have been going up into my eyebrows if I hadn't not applied the top. They seem like a good idea, but just weren't for me. ",0
"I tried this after the birth of my child. I wanted to get rid of dark spots and patches on my face. I saw little or no results. I love other products by Murad, but found this one did not deliver even after the whole jar. I wish I had reurned it, but I felt guilty about returning an empty a jar.",2
I tried this becuase everyone raved about it. It is a nice color for fair skin like mine and what I really like is that it has a faint shimmer - I am older (53) and my skin is still pretty smooth but I do have some wrinkles and I find blush with alot of shimmers accentuates the lines but this one does n ot - just gives me a nice subtle glow - definitly recommend this!,3
I tried this conditioner for the first time because I had read about it on other sites. It really does help preserve my color and leaves my hair soft. I've noticed my hair seems fuller when I blow dry it than it did before. ,2
"I tried this eyeshadow in ""Serenity"". The color looks a bit off in the picture, but it's a really nice apricot/peach color. It's long-lasting, doesn't crease for quite a while (I usually use primer, but I went without and it lasted several hours), and really brings out my blue eyes. ",0
"I tried this face wash after having tried just about everything already out there, regardless of price. My experience with other products was that either my face was not cleaned enough, or that my aging, dry, and sensitive skin would become irritated. This face wash allowed me to have my cake and eat it too. It cleans so thoroughly, but the exfoliating beads are so gentle I can use it both in the morning and at night. Thank you Bliss! ",2
"I tried this for the first time at my friend's wedding. It stayed in place all night through tears, dancing, and even rain. I immediately bought it in black with the eye liner brush and can't stop using it. I love being able to control the line and being able to brush the eye liner between my lashes to make them look thicker. Even if I line the inner rims of my eyes with this (which, I know, isn't recommended with any liner) it stays fresh all day. ",1
"I tried this foundation because I received it as a deluxe sample. I haven't looked back since! I can't believe how even my face looks after applying it. It also covers up absolutely everything, giving you a blank page to start with. ",1
"I tried this from a sample and fell in love with it! It gives just a hint of coverage to even out my skin tone...I add a bit of bare escentuals mineral foundation to matte it out, blush and mineral veil, and I'm ready to go! For the winter, it gives just a bit of extra coverage and some extra moisture. The SPF is an added bonus. I have oily skin, and this didn't make me break out..and I think it helped reduce my mid day shine. I can't say enough good things about it! ",2
"I tried this in a duty-free shop and fell in love with it. I've been using it all summer. It goes really well with my Sephora pink grapefruit body butter, thanks to its fruity scent. In fact, I love it so much, I keep it in the kitchen so I can sometimes spray the room with it. My one regret is that it is a summery scent so I'll have to put it away once fall shows up. On the other hand, I bet that in the cold, dark days of February I'll spray a bit of this to make me think that spring is just around the corner. ",4
"I tried this initially in a sample kit and ended up buying the full sized product. I love the smell and the soft, gel-like consistency of this cleanser. Be careful though, the product is rather slippery and it could end up in your sink if you don't immediately begin to lather it up or put on a washcloth.\n\nThis product is gentle, non-drying and really does what it says in the description!",2
"I tried this in my neverending search for the perfect mascara. I was not disappointed. This mascara gives a great sultry look, great with any smoky or dramatic eye. It's pricey, but better than buying 3 cheaper mascaras for the same price that you'll never use. ",0
"I tried this instead of sephora's own cuticle oils that are more expensive. This just didn't help my poor, dry, peeling cuticles at all. I went back to the Sephora cuticle oil that comes in a stick that you can turn the bottom of it and it clicks. With each click you get a little oil to use on a brush on the other end. There are 3 formulas: healing, stimulating and regular. they are worth the extra $3. This one, I'm sorry to say, didn't help at all. ",3
"i tried this in the store and wow, it's great. i got the sunrise one 001, but the lady tried another one on me and that one was great too. i had a hard time choosing between the two. it gives me the perfect flush, bronzy but the pink gives it a nice pop of color. you can blend all the colors together or use them individually. great product. ",1
"I tried this kit for the 1st time a couple of months ago after watching the infomercials forever. I'm really impressed!!! I live in the South with lots of heat and humidity and this lives up to its claims. The only thing I would change about it is that I still need to use some kind of other concealer with it, but overall think its' great. ",2
"I tried this line hoping it would help my skin, which had been great until I started breaking out on my lower face in my mid 20s. Though I'm now prone to breakouts, my skin is pretty sensitive, and this regimen was too harsh. It didn't help, and actually seemed to increase skin irritation. The only think I liked was the spot treatment. ",1
"I tried this lipstick and color for the first time. I really liked the color. I have NO color in my lips naturally, and so it was a little light in color, but nice for everyday lipstick. It wasn't as long-lasting as I had hoped.",2
I tried this lipstick because I use Bare Escentuals and love the product line from foundation to eye shadow and blush to the brushes. I was not disappointed by this wonderful lipstick. My favorite color so far is the Ripe Fig although I haven't tried any of the new shades yet. It should be noted that the price is excellent for a top of the line lipstick like this one. ,3
"I tried this perfume for the first time while on vacation in New York City a few years ago. I received a sample at Saks and wore this scent the whole time I was in the city. When the Sephora store opened in my town I kept going in to spritz the Stella, my boyfriend got it for me this Christmas. I love it, so feminine but not stuffy at all!",1
"I tried this product 15 years ago when it was in a Purchase w/purchase promotion and have used it ever since. It's the most gentle and best, non-stinging, non-drying eye make-up remover I had ever tried. I used to wear contacts back then and now I have Sjogren's syndrome which leaves my eyes very dry and more sensitive than ever. This is the only eye make-up remover I'll ever use!",4
I tried this product because everyone was raving how good the Murad brand was. I really love the on the spot acne treatment so I decided to give this product a try. I used it for 6 weeks and I didn't see any change on my skin at all. I really wanted this product to work....,1
I tried this product because of the fact that it was waterproof. Other similar products that I have used in the past smudge or rub off as the day goes on. This product was easy to apply but didn't really stay on any better than any other brand and for the price paid was simply not worth it. I won't purchase again.,4
I tried this product today for the first time and saw immediate phenomenal results. My hands have always gotten a lot of abuse and unfortunately it shows.This scrub gently removed all the dead rough skin. No product has ever produced these kind of results. It smells sweet and lemony. Next time I go to Sephora I will buy all that I can carry! ;) ,3
"I tried this product to ""rejuvenate [my] over-stressed tresses"" back when my hair was chemically treated (bleached, dyed, you name it). It's a very lightweight product, and really didn't do much for my hair back then. It probably would be ok on my hair now, which is dye-free. The scent was a bit too fruity for me. ",0
"I tried this scent after my little sister who is 18 years younger recommended it. I was afraid it might be too ""young"" for me, but I found it smelled fresh, pretty, and feminine without being too ""candy-like"". It has an almost woodsy undertone on me that I love, and that seems to balance the floral top notes quite well. The scent lasts all day, even on tough days after I've been running through airports and meeting with clients, but is not so overpowering that people comment on it. ",3
"I tried this set because of the combination of products. I've used Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer for years... it's the best! Having the primer, tinted moisturizer, and powder all-in-one seemed like a handy kit to have. ",4
"I tried this when i went in to Sephora for the first time, it is really neat! I didnt notice much at first besides the sparkle under the indoor lights, but when i got outside when ever i looked up from under a light it was like looking at a disco ball. My lashes were transformed from nice looking black to disco ball shine and sparkle. It is the best thing to dress up your usual look to go out somewhere hip or just a night out with the girls! Fantastic product! ",0
"I tried this with much skepticism as people either loved it or hated it. I have it in black (non-waterproof). I love it! It lengthens, curls (slightly), and plumps the lashes up while making them appear blacker than they are (mine are normally dark brown/black). For a more dramatic effect, I use the Shu Uemura lash curler before applying with 2-3 coats of Diorshow. Amazing! ",0
"I tried using this creme during the summer and was mortified that my face was immediately extra shiny. It seems very oily and heavy, which I guess might be good for the drier winter months. It does smell fantastic. ",1
"I truly adore this shadow! Although I have tried one other cream shadow which I do like, nars is by far supperior. My favorite is the color Mykonos (I own 4 so far) - a great neutral and look fabulous with green eyes. Most importantly, this shadow does not crease or give 'older' lids that dreaded crepey look. ",3
"I try to buy colors that are unique and unlike others that I own, when I saw the Matte Yellow I knew I had to try it. I have blue eyes and dark hair and this eye color looks great on me! It's very unusual, but I get quite a few compliments... I love to wear it every spring. The wearability of Make up forever is impressive, they stay on pretty much all day and crease only slightly, on me at least. They are also super pigmented, so you need to use less than a normal eye shadow... it's really worth the price that it is. ",1
"It's about time that Sephora added a Review sections! The colors are extreamly Pigmented and easily blend,I love the colors so much,It's been out of stock for almost a month or two and I wish it would come back so I can buy another one! :) I've been using this almost everyday,It's a gorgeous palette and has a large mirror inside. You should definetly get this! :) The colors are just absolutley AMAZING! ",0
"It's a good makeup brushes cleaner when I want them to be clean and dry quickly. What I have to do is just spray it 3-4 times onto a tissue and sweep the brush till I see the dirt and makeup show on the tissue. However, I hate the strong smell of it. It smells chemical to me. ",1
"it's a little sticky but it's not bad. has a subtle sweetness. it gives a sheer rose color, n i love the gold shimmer. it's a good day look for your lips n would def look nice over another color if youre looking for something a bit more dramatic. i didnt kiss anyone or eat anything, n needed to reapply after only 2 hours. for $18 , i dont think i would buy it again. ",0
"It's all in teh brushes! Want an airbrushed finish? Then stop the presses and buy a foundation brush! You will have a superior finish to your fav faoundation, use less (saving you money) and if you are prone to breakouts... you will get them less because you won't be using your hands to apply your makeup making for a much cleaner face! Why spend all that money on makeup unless you have the right tools? Plus, Smashbox rocks when it comes to pro tools and products. ",3
"Its a very tropical, coconutty fragrance...It smells good, but I'm not sure if I'd want to wear it all the time. It sort of smells like tanning lotion... However, as you can see, the packaging is adorable enough to justify buying it! hahah ",0
"Its better than Tarte liquid. Or Smashbox gel. I found that Tarte got thicker after 3 o4 uses. Sephora's brush is a little long, I cut it with cuticle scissors.. and now its manageable. It lasts long.. and its half as expensive. I can try more colors.. and have one in my purse! Thanks Sephora! ",4
"It's creamy, it's soft, it smells of rose petals, and most importantly, it absorbs into the skin *like that* It has the consistency of a lightweight, whipped lotion, but it moisturizes like a thick, buttery cream. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because my family holds their nose right after I apply this lotion. The smell is very overpowering at first, but after ten to fifteen minutes, it fades considerably. ",1
"It seems implausible, but in fact the results and ease of use of She Uemura are so much better than the 15+ others I've owned in my life. I wouldn't have tried except for the 'Best of's"", definitely try it you won't go back to any other curler. ",2
"It seems the pieces of glitter are too large. They do go everywhere. For days I had glitter in my hair and around the face hairline. Overall as long as I wasn't applying a heavy amount, it looked okay... ",4
"It's great for some, but it's too strong for others. It's true that one spray will last the entire day, but that may or may not be a good thing. For me it's just too cloyingly sweet, but my grandmother loves it. Go figure!",2
It's great for traveling. Heats up quick. Straightens fast. But no matter how hard I've tried I can't get my hair to curl with it. It is just too awkward. I can get one curl in the middle but it's straight everywhere else. ,1
"It's just a gloss that stings and kinda hurts. My lips are full to begin with, and I didn't think this made them any larger (though just about any light colored gloss will give the illusion that your lips are fuller, which this does). ",1
"It's just way too expensive for me to buy regularly. I decided to try it once when I was able to and loved it, but I wasn't able to re-order so I could see long-term results. If you can afford to use this long-term, I highly recommend it.",0
"It's kinda hard to tell what the colors look like from the color shots. I got Rosary. When I took it out of the box, I had my doubts, but when I put it on, I like it. It is dark, but I like the color. It also has a bluish undertone which makes my teeth look super white. I haven't worn it for a long period of time yet. I'm saving the first public display for a Christmas party. If it looks bad people will be too drunk to notice. LOL ",0
"It's kind of scary to try something new after you've used the same kind of makeup for so many years. Bare Escentuals made me glad I took the plunge! The coverage is fantastic! I can be pale or tan, shiny or matte, and I can hide my zits or let them hang out! I have huge pores and liquid makeup just runs right in. Bare Escentuals actually covers them up and makes me look like I have a nice complexion! I bought this as a gift for my sister because I love it so much! ",1
"It's lightweight if you don't use too much, but I really don't see the big deal. I bought this product when I had dyed hair, and it didn't really help the tangles, shine, or manageability. The scent was also a bit too green/fresh for me. ",0
"It's like a lipstick and a liner at the same time.Sometimes I use this all over the mouth and it gives me a matte finish, but it looks dry so I would have to put a gloss over it.It's ok as a liner but it doesn't stay on long. ",1
"It's listed as non-refillable, but it IS refillable, very easy. Just unscrew the bottle at the bottom and refill it. I really appreciate this feature. Also, the container has such a high shine that you can use the cap as a mirror when you're on the go. I love Mineral Veil for its nice soft finish, like the name says: a soft veil of minerals for a finishing touch and touch-ups through the day and evening. ",4
"It smells great and feels cool on the face at first, but it's greasy and so thick that I felt like my pores were clogged all day. You also need to blend it in well or you'll have white marks on your face. Another reviewer said that your skin naturally gets greasy over the course of the day but this sunscreen made my skin more greasy than usual. So I'm still on my search for a good mineral sunscreen. :( ",2
"It smells like chocolate which is good, but it does make a big mess in the tub. The exfolliating you get from this is pretty good, but with the shape of it you have to keep going over your body to get it all. To me it leaves a sticky kinda feeling. I end up washing with a sponge after using this. ",4
It's my go-to staple! Pretty much goes with any look I'm trying to create & gives the most perfect glow! Girls are always commenting on pretty I look when I'm sporting this blush! Totally buildable & long-lasting color. It's a must-have!... =),1
It's not my favorite lipstick-- it dries out too easily and is hard to apply. I always need a brush to apply this lipstick evenly and appropriately. I do love the colors though and the color names-- an inspiring bunch of lipsticks. I only wish it went on smoothly.,0
"It's ok, but have had better. Has a very greasy feel, but made my skin soft while applying. The next morning did not feel a softness that I usually get from others. I have dry shins and apply moisturizers nightly, and this one did not carry me through. ",2
"It's OK. I'm used to lining my eyes with cake liner and a wet brush, so thought I would try the gel. It is hard to get the right amount on the brush and still make a a fine line very close to my eye lashes. It tends to glob. It might take some getting use to. It does last though. ",4
"It's one of the most wonderful packages they have out there. for the price!!! And, now you are discontinuing it! WHY!!? It's affordable and it has EVERYTHING we love.. My sister, niece, mother and myself all are into this and have bought 1 to 2 each thus far and have gotten 2 to 3 friends to as well. Now we are all into it you have discontinued a producted we all have found very economically fesible ",3
"It's sad that this product will no longer be sold by Sephora....I have tried at least 9 different makeup removers for my waterproof mascaras and this is by far the best!!! It doesn't leave a greasy feeling and doesn't leave flakes/chunks of mascara on my lids and eye area. It smells and feels great, is easy to dispense and lasts me about 40 days (I wear waterproof 5 days a week). I do agree with the other reviewer in that it leaks when shaken, but just hold the cotton pad on the dispenser while shaking and you will catch the leak (not much btw). ",1
It's silky and lightweight - yet it feels just luxurious. I've tried a lot of eye creams. I just love the way this one feels on my eyes and on my fingers as I'm putting it on. It smells clean and not overpowering. It's a keeper.,2
"It's silky, not sticky, and not oily or greasy. Less is more! Just one pump does it, so the little bottle lasts a long time. Bare Minerals can go on immediately after it's applied, and the look lasts all day with no shine. Great price on top of all that.",4
It's the brush - it must be because i've tried hundreds of mascaras (literally) and this gives me INSTANT FAKE LASHES. It's all in the way you apply so make sure you start of close to the lash line wriggling your way up to the tips. It sucks that it dries out so quickly and it's costly but the brush is where it's at here and I've not found ONE brush applicator that comes close. This is ONE product that is ALWAYS in my stash of goods. Not waterproof - that's just a bit much for my taste because it's tough of the lashes. ,1
"It took a couple weeks, but my skin has never looked better. I even got a compliment on my skin tone and ""barely visible"" pores! That's a first! The kit has lasted for nearly a month and I still have enough left for at least two more weeks. I may buy another kit rather than spending over $100 on the full size versions. ",2
"It took me about 2 days to get used to using a cleanser that isn't out of control ""sudsy!"" My skin feels clean and soft after using it. I just wish I could find a pump for the large bottle I buy. I've even converted my mother and 2 aunts!",1
"I t works. I been using it for a very short time, but my eye area seems lineless. I have hooding also and this cream does seem to work on that. Great under my concealer, doesn't pill like some other more expensive eye creams. ",3
"I use all Ole Henriksen products, so where to start my reviews.. the Ornage Line? this eye cream is the bomb. You can use right under your eyes. i have really sensative eyes and this product does not bother them what so ever. very smooth and hydrating!! ",3
"I use a lot of eye treatment generally the area around my eyes is somewhat oily. This mascara does not smudge unlike all the rest I have used. It lengthens and separates nicely. The brush I have is like soft rubber, I understand the product comes with three or four different brushes. I like the soft rubber one because it makes doing the lower lashes so easy. No wonder this is the number one mascara on the market.",4
"I use and Love Hope in a Jar and was very excited to get this this day cream with SPF. I really didn't like the texture af first, but use it daily and I have come to like it. It really protects my skin from the sun and has the same benifits as the original. ",3
"I use as eye and lip foundation.\nEven though YSL also sells concealer, I also use this as a concealer sometimes and definitely under the eyes.\nIt is my little secret weapon.\nIt always amazes me how long these pens last.\nThe applicator is excellent as I can control where it goes.\nStill, I end up blending in with a sponge or with fingers.",1
"I use Auburn and the color is the most real to nature and easy to apply brow color I have ever used. You will want to apply this product with BE's Angled Brow Brush for the most precise of apps, making sure to tap off the excess powder [I also blot the brush on a towel] for a sheer, nothing overdone look of natural beauty! ",2
"I use Bare Minerals every day and I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look. I have oily skin and am prone to break outs, but B.M.'s actually improves not only the look, but the health of my skin. I also have rosacea and it cover the redness on my cheeks flawlessly.",0
"I used an earlier version of this cream and loved it. It got so expensive that I switched to different creams, from one to another. None of them were as good as this one, so I'm back. It feels so nice and I guess it makes my skin look better because I get compliments about what nice skin I have............and I'm 63 years old!!!!\nThe only thing I wish it had is an SPF protection level.",4
I used both during the summer and I got so many compliments from it. Body Glow is actually tiare flower and coconut ground up to make a chocolately brown and the Glow II is Monoi de Tahiti (tiare flower) with an actual bud inside the body. I used Glow II after I got out of the shower and Body Glow after sunbathing. It made my already tanned skin look even tanner. I like that because Im dominican and it made me feel as if I was back home on the island. ,0
"I use Diorshow Blackout as a second coat - just tipping the upper lashes. It gives dramatic length and fullness in just a touch. I have long, fairly thick lashes, but they are nearly invisible - very blonde - so this helps show what I have naturally. Much, much easier than trying to supplement with false lashes.",4
"I used it on a vacation in Mexico, and it worked well to prevent sunburn. However, it says that it is extremely perspiration resitant, and I would not agree. I used it while running in the hopes that it would protect my skin, but it dripped into my eyes and burned. ",2
"I used Shiseido Benefiance Concentrated Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream for 15 years , it isn't dry out my skin, I love it. Since last couple months Shiseido released the White Lucent Brightening Eye Treatment is designed to diminish those dark spots and dullness areas around the eyes. I'm Asian have fair skin, as 45+ my most concerned right now is dark spots and wrinkles around my eyes. So, I ordered and tried for 3 weeks ... Yes,I love it ! it's very moisturizing, smooth, and greaseless. I just used 1 small pump that enough for both eyes beside it's contained Multi-luminizing powder which brighten my eye areas. Now I'm order second kit, before my supply run out. This is Good Value kit. I recommended this eye treatment to my relatives,some ordered on Sephora.com (only) to take advantage of a Sephora-exclusive skin-brightening kit. Thanks Shiseido and Sephora for this ""White Lucent Brighten Up Eye Kit"" ",3
I used the Ironless Straightening Balm and the Finishing Cream last night and my hair looked amazing after just a blow dry with a round brush! Normally A when I dry my hair with a round brush I still have to straighten it because there is lots of frizz and wavy spots but after just using the Ironless Balm my hair looked salon style sleek and the Finishing Cream was like the icing on the cake. I have yet to try the Anti-Frizz but if it is anything like the other 2 products in this kit then I am sure it is awesome!! I am totally going to invest in the full size bottles! ,0
I used the mineral makeup for a while and that was the worst stuff ever to put on oily skin. This is so great for acne and this is not harsh at all! You don't need very much! I recommend applying this with a brush so that it smooths out evenly since liquid makeup can be kind of tricky. I'm also a light Hispanic and the colors and aren't orange at all like most. It matched perfectly with my skin tone! ,0
"i used the Peter Thomas Roth 3% glycolic cleanser for 5 years before switching to this one last year. it still has glycolic acid, which i especially like for its exfoliating properties, but it seems gentler for daily use and smells better.",2
"I used this after getting chemical peels for my acne, and it soothed, moisturized, and helped with the irritation. It didn't cause any breakouts, either. This is a great product for stressed skin of all ages. ",0
"I used this along with the conditioner and glossing cream. The shampoo has olive oil extracts and it cleans your hair without stripping the natural shine in your hair. When used along with the conditioner, your hair will feel smoother, shinier, and less frizzy. It gives dry hair a boost of gloss, especially the ends where it's normally dry and dull. Not to mention it smells great! ",1
"I used this before switching to Murad's Clarifying Cleanser. This cleanser is great for a basic skin care regimin. I do have occasional breakouts here and there, so I did switch to something to heal the occasional blemishes, but this cleanser is great if you dont need the extra blemish control!",1
"I used this cream for a couple months, and I did not notice any change in my skin, good or bad. However, I am 30, and I do not have any fine lines yet. The cream was a nice souffle-like consistency, and it absorbed well. I have normal skin, and the cream never made my face feel tight or dry. This cream could have been a good preventive measure, but it may be better suited for more mature skin. ",1
"I used this eye cream several years ago and absolutely loved it, but that was before 2 kids and lots of bags and deeper lines. I had switched to Ole Henriksen and thought I liked that one, it was a bit lighter so my eye makeup stayed put. I noticed the skin around my eyes was becoming much drier, my lines were really deepening. I've tried many others, but my skin is super sensitive and i find most creams too drying or I end up being allergic. So I switched back to Benefiance just over a week ago. Not only has my skin softened and shown considerable improvement in hydration and elasticity, but in just a week, I can visibly see a 20% reduction in those wrinkles! A little does go a long way, though I've really been laying in on thick, it feels so good! My eyes were so thirsty! I'll never take this miracle cream for granted again. The only slight drawback is that it is quite rich (not greasy), so my eyeliner tends to run at bit. I'll happily give up eyeliner.",1
I used this for several years until I started getting wrinkles and I have dry skin. Perfect for oily skin.....gives a great finish. With dry skin under my eyes and the winkles I have....this product makes my wrinkles show more. Fabulous for oily skin. ,3
"I used this on a Philosophy lip pencil that I was ready to throw out...my old sharpener just tore it up. I had no idea it was the shapener, not the pencil that was bad. This was was inexpensive & works great! ",3
"I used this over different brands of mascara and even used a fine lash comb to remove clumps and excess. Just the same, the product would not dry thoroughly, and I wound up with my top and bottom lashes sticking together and having to be carefully pried apart. As with others, I also had great difficulty removing the product no matter what brand or type of eye makeup remover I used. ",4
I used this product and after only a week my scars had faded considerably and my skin looke dbright and incredbile! Thism product has got to be one of my all time faves. I would never have thought that any product could do what this does and it is so gentle. My scars are 100% gone now and I only used half a bottle! ,1
"I used this product and broke out like never before. I kept using it thinking my skin was clearing itself out, but after another two months, my skin was redder than ever and I had more zits than I have ever had in my life! I would not recomend this to anyone with normal/dry skin. ",1
"I used this product daily for well over a year and loved it. I had to start using something stronger to control my breakouts, so I had to stop using this. I recommend this, along with the rest of the Bare Minerals regimen, for anyone with clear to mild breakouts. ",0
"I used this product for a long time, then decided to try some other concealers. Big mistake!!!\nNothing works as well as Touche Eclat, as long as you follow their recommendations and clean the brush with alcohol.\nThis is the product to try if you want to fight the lines and wrinklew without resorting to lasers or injections.",4
I used this product for a week but found it too drying. I have some post blemish discoloration and thought this may help to get rid of them. It may be a good product for use in the summer. I have the Acne Scrub by DDF and love it. It is not drying on my skin. ,3
"I used this product once a day, every day for 3 weeks straight and to be honest I didn't see much of a difference. My face did feel softer but my acne scars were not any lighter. A friend told me I should try it 2-3 times a day but I'm just not convinced. A little goes a long way and it has a weird smell.",0
"I used this product this summer in Puerto Rico. I was in the pool and in the ocean every day during my vacation and I made sure to put on the spray. It is not greasy, combs right through and protected my hair from the hot sun and water. ",4
"I used this when it first came out years ago and I didn't notice a difference. But I didn't know they came out with a scrub also... maybe I'll try them together...\n\nOh, and the scent didn't offend me and wasn't noticable to my boyfriend.",1
I used to be a bare essentials girl through and through. I've used all sorts of products always trying to find out what the best thing for me was. Every item in the kit works perfect together and it doesn't even look like i have make up on. It's perfect. ,0
"I used to be a big fan of Philosophy products. I'm finding over the years the scent fades quickly or there is hardly any scent in the products. I bought the eggnog 3 in 1 last year and it was heavenly, this year, I can hardly smell anything. ",3
I used to be changing toner all the time. Now I've had three of this toner/serum. Always love it. I have sensitive skin. The toner gives me the stimulating feel while it's alcohol free. It feels so good and you can feel the tightening of the pores.,1
"I used to think that a concealer needed to be thick and heavy to do a good job. But I learned that heavy concealers stand out like a sore thumb and actually draw attention to the very spot you're trying to hide. I also used to think that a lightweight powder concealer couldn't possibly hide my rosacea and other blotchy skin problems. Boy, was I wrong! I was without it for several years and tried many other concealers, but nothing works as well as Bisque! Now I buy two at a time so I don't have to worry about ever running out again!! I'm a senior citizen and find that the soft look of Bare Minerals products are much more flattering for someone my age.",4
"I used to use a brand my licensed only retailer used to sell, then, they discontinued it. I've been trying different things for about a year now and no luck. I decided to try clinique after using it as a kid. My sensitive, break out prone skin has NEVER felt better! After i finish with it, i splash my face with cold water to close my pores and my skin is so radiant. Love it!!",0
"i used to use burjois mascar and i got this one by chance. ONe of the ladys at sephora told me about it when it just had come out and ever since then i LOVE this mascara!! I have kind of long lashes as it is but this just thickens, lengthens and REALLY makes your eyelashes pop!!! I usually put 2 coats on, but for night time, if i want add more dramatic effect to them and make them seem super thick and long i will add another coat. what i love about this mascara, is even after its dried you can still add another coat w/o it clumping having your lashes look reall overdone. GREAT GREAT GREAT product!! My mom has short lashes and i put it on her and INSTANTLY she had lashes! she was soo amazed! ",0
"i used to wear diorshow, which i do love, however, i like this just a little better (and its cheaper!) Nice even coverage on all my lashes and it doesn't smear and end up on my face at the end of the day (when i wear some mascaras i end up looking like a racoon by the end of the day) awesome product!",1
"I used to work with a gal with skin like a porcelain doll. I asked her what her skin care regime consisted of, and she used this product as her moisturizer. I promptly made a trek to Sephora to purchase a bottle. the formula is light, more like a serum than a moisturizer, and absorbs beautifully. it has a lovely citrusy scent. and it is perfect for anyone with acne or confused skin, like my combination face which breaks out but has a dry surface. it is an ideal daytime moisturizer as it is very light and does not make your face oily or cause your makeup to fade. I would also recommend it as a serum underneath a night creme to boost the skin's repair process in the p.m. the second ingredient- not the fourth or fifth- in this product is Ascorbyl Glucoside which is vitamin C, so you are getting a power-packed treatment product. vitamin C is an antioxidant that fights against the actions of free radicals that can damage skin. the air is full of free radicals in the form of car exhaust, etc. so adding this product to your skin care arsenal will protect your skin from their aging influence. does not irritate my very sensitive skin. a lovely product. ",2
"I use it everyday. I put it on elbows, knees, lips. I use it to condition my eyelashes and put on my eyebrows to keep them in place. when I got a runny nose and the area was dry, it was perfect without being greasy.",1
I use it every night after a long-night out and my eye makeup which is the hardest to remove easily comes right off. I don't have to worry about my eye lashes breaking off with this product because its gentle.,0
"I use it to highlight or as a base and even to mix with other colors to change colors. It brightens the eyes , you can use it to conceal dark spots or use in inner eye corners. Because it is light I don't have a problem with fall out under eye. (I use tissue layed under eye for dark colors) I LOVE the one I got because there are SO many uses! It blends easy and can use wet or dry. REALLY nice. ",4
"I use it with Smashbox foundation and concealer. For the first time in my life, I am not shopping around for something better. With everything else I have used (and I used to model so had a lot of stuff stuck to my head), this is the first product that I cannot complain about or find a flaw. Perfect base, covers enlarged pores near nose, and I am NOT shiny by noon. People have commented on how young I look--I had a nice lapse in that observation of at least 9 months. It is expensive, but\nit is not part of the makeup museum cluttering my drawer (I have stuff I quit using dating back to 1989).",2
"I use many different moisturizers for different times and applications but this is the standard that I always have on hand. I have used it from the time I was in my 20's and have never been without it on my make up counter. You can't go wrong with this one, no matter what your need or skin type is. ",3
I use many of the Ojon products and this is one of my favorites. I apply the Ojon Elastin Tamer to wet hair and after I blow dry apply this serum. It seems to protect my hair before I use the flat iron. My hair end up silky soft and shiny. Love it! ,3
I use my flat iron practically every day and this has served me well. It heats quickly and lets you know when it has reached your desired heat setting. Also the swivel cord is great. And the little jewels on top are a cute touch. ,0
I use NARS lipstick and love it but this blush was a little disappointing for the price. It did not last a long time after I appiled it. The color was very light not like what I saw on the computer. Just a little too sheer coverage for me.,2
"I use only one shade but i can't wait to start a collection. This blush is so great. I use ""org**m"" and it leaves just enough color. Not too heavy either. I even have the matching lipgloss. I thought this shade might not work for my east indian complexion but it's just phenomenal!",1
I use Orgasm and Sin on a regular basis and they are the best blushes I have personally ever used. They have a touch of sparkle but match any skin tone. My friends can use it and they all look fabulous!,0
I use orgsm. it is amazing! i've used so many different kinds but this is by far the best. its stays on all day and all night without comming off at all. its the perfect color if you have fair skin in the fall and perfect for tan or darker skin during the summer.also i only buy it once a year maybe longer. i use it everyday and its still not gone after that. only problem i have with it is the price. but i say if you only have to buy it once a year it isnt so bad.,0
"I use Pure Grace Body Lotion in my guest bathroom. The scent is so light and clean smelling, that I've noticed both women and MEN will come out using the lotion on their hands. It's so nice to feel that I can add some pampering to all my guests' stay!",4
"I use the extra mild version and absolutely love it! It cleanses without leaving my skin feeling dry or tight. It's mild enough to use on skin with rosacea. Best of all, a little goes a long way because it creates nice foamy suds.",2
"I use the ""Flash"" palette, and let me tell you, the lightest shade is the PERFECT neutral base color for practically all my eye-looks. The green isn't dark enough to use as a liner in my opinion- even when wet- but it makes a good crease color. ",1
"I use the full-size items at home, so it is great to have a pair to take on vacation. The Aqua Eyes pencil is the best and longest-lasting eyeliner that works in a hurry. Sens'Eyes removes all eyemakeup quickly, completely, and without irritation. ",4
"I use the gold for eyes on the lid, or as highlighter near the brows.The white highlighter works good for the corners of the eyes. The rose shade is a nice lip color and I use the highlighter in the center of the lps. I think the brush is quality and the compact is thin and fits in a purse. ",4
"I use the Kabuki Brush daily. I have a few acne scars on my face that are ""red"". This brush along with Bare Escentuals Foundation completely make my face look flawless. I apply in circles to get complete coverage. The Kabuki brush is easy to use and goes on fast. I get asked all the time what makeup I wear...If only they could see what I look like before I apply Bare Escentuals makeup.",1
"I use the liner shadows dry when I want subtle, and when I want to define my eyes I use the BareMinerals liner liquid to make my own new liner every day of the week. If I'm using a strong color palette for my shadows, I like to use the liner shadow blended with a little of the color for a unique look. ",1
"I use the shade ""O"" (peachy pink with shimmer) . I can use this product all year long, it gives my cheeks a gorgeous soft pink glow whether I am tanned or not. My favorite thing about this product is how natural it looks while delivering pretty sparkles.",0
"I use the shade ""Outlaw"". I love it, it gives me just the right amount of that flushed color, without ever looking overdone. And the amount of product in the compact lasts a long time, so it is great value too!",0
"I use the Tint color frequently just for a bit of warmth. I use sparingly because it does have some shimmer that could get overwhelming. The Tint is not orange, not brown, not pink, but just perfect blend of all three for medium skin. Definitely a sheer color. ",1
I use this after I put on my make up...I give a spritz or 2 to break up that overly powdery look. I use this after my Bare Escentials application. Great scent. Also great if you travel.....helps to hydrate the skin. Highly recommend!!,2
"i use this at night before bed. it keeps my lips hydrated and smooth (thanks to those little micro-crystals). plus this is pretty large in size. when i ordered it online i expected it to be the normal sized small gloss pot. but no, it's about the size of a compact and has a mirror too! ",1
"I use this bronzer all year long - it looks natural and has just enough 'glow' to make my skin sparkle. I use it with Sephora's bronzer brush, which makes application a breeze. Try it - you'll love it! Gives you that sun-kissed look without ruining your skin with those nasty UV rays.",4
"I use this brush for everything, my illuminizer, powder from a compact and blush in compact. It's a great go to brush, washes nicely too. You can use it for light touches or pack on for a deeper finish or blush. It's the most expensive I've paid for a brush, so I make use of it!! ",3
"I use this color in Aubergine, which is great for hazel eyes. This color not only stays put all day or night, it makes hazel eyes look super green. Have tried & tested many others, but this one is a sure winner! ",1
"I use this dry over primer instead of a foundation and it is WONDERFUL. The range of shades allows for a perfect tone and depth. It covers beautifully and stays on a long time. I haven't neede to apply with damp sponge for more coverage but like the option available. Superior product. One drawback, compact is not refillable so you have to buy a new one each time...waste of plastic and refills would save $$$ to spend on other products!!!",4
"I use this EVERYDAY now. I can't go out without it. I use the 'luminous' shade, am fair skinned, and it looks and feels absolutely amazing! As far as makeup goes, I've never ever had such an immediate addiction as I have to this product. It does everything the description says, and I swear my skin absolutely stays hydrated all day... never needs a touch up of moisturizer or gets that midafternoon dry patches. The longer I use it, the more I love it. Definitely a mainstay in my regimen. ",1
"I use this every night before I go to sleep and wake up with wonderfully soft hands. It seems to get a little greasy on me, so I don't like to use it at work, but once a day seems to be enough for me. I am a nurse, washing my hands all the time, and this prevents cracked hands during the winter. ",1
"I use this eyebrow brush with BareMinerals eyebrow powder, it's perfect for applying the right amount of color to my brows, and the bristles are soft yet do the trick, other brushes I have tried are coarse or hard and don't hold the powder well enough to apply on my brows the way I like.",1
"I use this eye contouring pencil in the corner of my eyes mostly, it gives the look of refreshed especially when you are tired. I feel that is a little bit dry for someone over 50 you don't want to stretch the skin under your eyes so I spread it with my Sephora concealer brush instead of the tip of my finger it works just fine and it stays on all day. ",4
I use this facial wash daily and absolutely LOVE it. I have combination skin and find that this cleanser does a good job of cleaning off my makeup completely without drying out my skin. I've always had issues with my skin and finding something that will keep it clean and not make me break out is HUGE. I am glad I've found a keeper!,1
"I use this hair balm when I am either flat ironing my hair or blowing it out with a round brush. The results are awesome. It makes my coarse, wavy, color treated hair so smooth, shiny, bouncy and healthy looking. It also smells wonderful. It's lightweight and absorbs quickly. Love it! ",3
"I use this liner under the outer edges of eyes and it stays put all day and does not smudge. As a make up aratist, I recommend to only line the outer edges of your eyes. When you line them all the way around it can make the eyes look smaller and too close together.........just a hint. This liner is great because it stays where you put it. ",4
"I use this mister in the morning as a""toner"". im so used so using a toner after face washes that I do feel uncomfortable when I don't; my skin would feel tight if i dont. However I do have combo/oily skin and using a toner in the morning tends to make my face a little too moisturized and my face ends up being oilier than usual. I've been using evian for the last year as a morning ""toner"" because its so light and refreshing, you can't even feel it, but you can definitly see how your skin looks really refreshed. After I wash my face, instead of sprayin it on, I'd spray it on a cotton pad and sweep it over my face for that extra cleaning effect while it lightly moisturizes. I know it seems kinda blah because it's just ""water"", but using it in the morning to clean, lightly moisturize and prep my skin for makeup seems pretty reasonable, better than using something else i know would make my skin oily. Never sprayed it directly over my makeup, pretty skeptical but will try one day, also never tried it on an airplane, but I'm hoping to be able to try it in december, or atleast using it in humid weather, can't wait! Vietnam here I come!",0
i use this mixed with my stila illuminating foundation and it makes my skin look flawless. I'm very fair and it adds a nice glow without making me look fake tanned. I wore this to a wedding with a little bronzer over my cheeks and got so many compliments....must have ,1
"I use this moisturizer for day and its companion for night in combination with the VinoPerfect serum. AMAZING results. My skin is glowing, any redness I had has disappeared almost completely, and fine lines and freckling are going, going, gone as well. I hesitate to give it 5 stars because I want to be sure it is in stock when I need my refill but by the same token, it's such a great product people should know about it. ",2
I use this my hair and both daughter's hair...even though we have very different hair types. Two are curly and frizz-prone while my littlest one still has baby hair...thin and straight as a stick. Yet this product works amazingly well for all three of us! You can't beat that! We use it a leave in conditioner that also help with styling. I highly recommend it. Someone mentioned that the beads were smushed in her hair. It states on the bottle that you MUST rub palms together to emusify the beads before applying. There...Problem solved. ,2
"I use this once a week on one of my 'no shampoo' days. It is thick and creamy and will stay on while you attend to things like shaving your legs. It leaves my hair (color treated) feeling moisturized, but not weighed down. I recommend it highly! ",3
"I use this powder to fill in sparser hair areas on my brows. I am very impressed by the ease of using this brow powder. It is very soft, not hard looking at all. And it stays all day! I use a stiff angle brush to apply. Even though I am a brunette, I like the dark shade of the Ash Blonde. It is perfect to define my eyebrows.",1
I use this prior to applying moisturizers as an enhancer and to revitalise the skin. It helps to stimulate the circulation and makes me feel rega the way only a french products can! I have a large bottle in my bathroom and small ones at work and in my bag.,0
I use this product almost daily. I like the fact that it has a high SPF and it goes on smoothly. It's not my favorite tinted moisturizer (Stila is my favorite) but it works well for what it was designed to do. ,1
"I use this product almost exclusively. Once I tried it, I was hooked. Lovely, clean smell. I especially love the fact that it's brushable, and once I put it on for the day, it stays there without a heavy, tacky feeling. I can't recommend this product enough! ",3
I use this product because I have a few fine lines under my eyes and a little bit of puffiness. This product works great to fix both those problems. I've read other reviews and was surprised by how well it worked for me. I've tried lots of products to minimize puffiness and this is the best I've found. ,1
"I use this product every morning and night and I find it has definitely reduced the redness in my skin (I have rosacea), and helps control my occasional break outs. You don't need to use much, so it really lasts too. ",1
"I use this product in conjunction with the Bliss ""Ingrown Hair Eliminating Pads"" and while I don't love those this product is great. I use it on my bikini area after shaving and using the pads which contain alcohol. It keeps my skin from drying out, helps to prevent irritation and best of all it doesn't sting my sensitive skin! The scent is pleasant, but I don't know if I'd want to use it over my whole body. I'm considering buying the full size of this product. ",0
I use this product to touch up my makeup because my skin gets oily especially in the t zone so instead of applying additional makeup i use this product to even out the shine..and i use it once around the afternoon to keep my makeup fresh...i also use it when i dont wear makeup it leaves a nice matte finish ,1
"I use this regularly at night and during the day. Yes it is a bit costly, but it lasts... at least for me it does. I love this stuff. I put it on and almost instantly am aware of my lips and how full they feel. They also make my lips flush just a bit so it's nice to wear alone during the day. Recently, I let my mother, who due to aging and an accident she had, has a very small upper lip. I applied it for her, as the loving daughter that I am... and by the time she had walked to the mirror her upper lip had,""Appeared."" She was saying ""Oh my God! I have an upper lip again!!!"" Totally funny and totally worth it. Her next beauty purchase will be Lipfusion XL, after she finishes mine off. ",1
I use this shadow in the cultured pearl to give my eyes a natural *awake* look! I brush it on from lid to brow and rub gently with a finger to soften and blend. The light color and shimmer covers dark spots and makes me look more awake and alert! I love it for a natural eye brightener on days I don't want a made-up eyehadow look. ,2
I use this treatment often. This is great for moisturizing your hair and scalp. It is easy to wash out and really makes a differnce in the texture. I usually sleep with it in my hair and rinse out the next morning. ,2
"I use this when I want more coverage under eyes and on red areas around nose. I use a concealer brush to blend. Seems to last when I use a primer first. I use it with my mineral powder foundation, and it blends well. ",1
I use this when my skin is extra oily. I don't know about the rest of you but the condition of my skin changes from oily to dry depending on many things. This works great to keep the oil away and it never feels too drying. I love that it has an SPF! ,3
"I use this with Tarte Lights, Camara, Splashes mascara. I've had a love-hate relationship with mascara for quite a while 'cause I either blink or smudge it or something. I'm getting a lot better, but I feel so much better about how my lashes look when I use this because it is a great help creating the definition I want. I credit the brush for that. It's just right. Also it treats my lashes which are thin and fine naturally. You won't see any thing on the brush when you pull it out of the container, but that treatment's there and it works well in combo with Tarte mascara. I don't see why it wouldn't work well with other mascaras as well. ",3
I use Zero on the inside of my eyes and they have never looked so blue! Wouldn't recommend it for the ouside though... smudged tremendously for me... So I have another brand for that jazz. Waterproof and long-lasting beyond belief for the inside of eyes :) Have converted many friends to this wonderful eyeliner.,0
"I usually don't write reviews, but had to for this perfume. I purchased based on the good reviews and I usually love oriental/musky/sweet scents. But, this perfume is horrible! It smells EXACTLY like black licorice. I would recommend you smell this perfume before buying it. The scent makes me feel nauseous...It is definitely NOT hypnotic or alluring...it is a horrible waste of money.",1
I usually only wear foundation for special occasions and opt for tinted moisturizer or very lightweight foundation for everyday use. Now that I found a foundation that really does feel AND look as if I have no makeup at all... I can wear it almost everyday! Does not make my skin dry or oily and I haven't had any breakouts! ,0
"I usually use Orgasm to tone down a darker lip shade or jazz it up a bit. It's light and tends to bring out the red in my skin when I use it by itself, so if I'm having trouble with flushing it's got to be blended with something else. On good skin days, it's fine alone, lasts a long time and gives a full, rich lip look. ",3
"I've always avoided cream blushes before, because I though they'd be difficult to apply in a natural-looking way -- that they would not spread out evenly and look blotchy. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that this mousse formula is quite slippery, so blends easily into a very natural look that seems to come from within rather than just laying on top of other makeup. ",2
"I've always had a problem with acne on my back and this product definitely worked for me! After one tube I can see a dramatic difference. This product is exfoliating, treats and heals problem acne. Compared to over the counter this product will not dry out your skin. Use with the clarifying spray for maximum results. I'm already done with my second tube and might not need to buy it again since the acne on my back is virtually healed!",1
"I've always had a problem with flaky skin around my chin and this exfoliating mask was my answer. One application and the flakiness was gone, my chin felt smooth and I was a happy camper. The brown sugar and strawberries smell great by the way. However I don't feel my skin stays soft for too long. This mask will give me a nice glow for a day or 2. Like I said...quick fix!",1
"I've always had a very hard time finding mascaras which curled my long lashes and added volume without clumping or smearing. I bought Diorshow Mascara in Black the day it was introduced to Sephora. I was that excited by the promises, and know that Sephora has THE BEST.. The product delivers in all ways for me, I was very loyal to a mascara in a brand which Sephora doesn't sell and considered it to be the standard against which all mascaras were measured until I tried Diorshow. I threw the other mascara away after using Diorshow for a few days!! I find it to be creamy, very easy to apply with good coverage, not flakey at all, and also mild and non-irritating to my eyes as a contact lens wearer. Living in Texas,durability outdoors is also a factor. This is CULT status mascara. It should be in everyone's beauty kit as a staple, with a spare always handy.. ",3
"I've always had hair that gets oily around 24 hours after washing so I've always had to wash it every day. Even though my ends tended to be dry... and i know you're not supposed to wash your hair every day. With this, I can go up to FOUR DAYS without washing my hair! ***My hair is blonde so I'm not sure how good this would work and look in darker hair... TIPS: I put it in before i go to bed and it does a great job of dispersing through my hair. I then will touch up in the morning before I leave the house. I usually wash my bangs in the sink bc I want them to be clean (to prevent forehead acne). but it saves so much time not having to wash my hair every day!!!! ",1
"I've always had issues with bumps on my upper arms, but have been able to keep them away with regular exfoliation. However, after the birth of my son, the bumps got worse and there was nothing I could do to get rid of them until I got KP Duty. The next day after using this, I noticed a big difference. My upper arms feel smooth again!",1
"I've always hated metallic shadows. However, I bought ""Strobe"" for three reasons: 1.) Each color complements my pale-as-a-ghost, blue-toned skin, 2.) I love each color individually, as well as together, thus justifying spending so much money on ""metallics"", and 3.) They are the 3 colors in a shiny silk dress I just bought for a party. In fact, the shadows feel as silky under my fingers as does the dress. I found that when I use the ocean blue on the lid, the golden brown in the crease, and the shimmering pearl on the brow, the combination really makes my eyes look larger. ",2
"I've always heard that its perferred that someone in their 20s wear tinted mosturizer versus foundation. I never found one I liked until this one, its perfect! The conceler doesn't budge all day, and it all blends perfect! ",1
"I've always liked Mineral Veil, but am not a great fan of loose powders, in general. This delivery system is fabulous. I bought one, used it and immediately bought a second so I'd have it when I use up the first! ",4
"I've always loved applying lipcolor with a brush and this is a fabulous way to try several BE colors before buying the full size. The compact is lovely and I especially like the ""rubberized"" texture of the outside of the compact because it doesn't show scratches and bumps from being carried around in a purse. The brush wipes off easily with a tissue, ready to try on another color. Great product. ",4
"I've always loved Smashbox lipgloss ant still do, just don't care for the new applicator. I liked the colors I purchased except for Pout, it did nothing for me but I'm too embarrassed to take back a gloss I've tried. I'll stick to the ones I know I like! not sticky, nice shine! ",4
"I've always loved the smell of clean babies, and that's totally what this makes me think of. My boyfriend has even started using it, and it doesn't smell too girly for him. Just clean! Great as shampoo in a pinch also...",2
"I've always read/heard how wonderful this blush was. After buying it I can't agree more. ""O"" is beautiful when applied. It is very versatile so it looks good with a natural daytime look, and even better for an evening look. I've also used it as a pretty shadow for my eyes. Can't praise it enough.",1
"I've always thought that buying environmentally friendly, healthy cosmetics meant that I had to accept the dry, cakey, ill-smelling natural wares hawked by other lines. I was pleasantly surprised to find this palette in the Sephora store in Ottawa. The colours are fantastic, smooth to apply and long-lasting. And the very best part? I'm not allergic to them like I am to 99% of all other eyeshadows on the market. They are beautiful and shimmery, but not glittery, and the brown-gold-green shades really make my blue eyes pop. The blushes are beautifully silky too, and I have used them as eyeshadows to good effect. All in all this is an excellent palette, and an absolute steal at only $36. ",2
"I've always used a powder-based primer for eyelids, and they worked, but made my eyelids look crepey. This is a genius creme that does exactly what it's supposed to do. You MUST make sure to cover the eyelid all the way up to the eyebrow or your mascara will leave little splotches. It's reasonably priced, too! ",4
"I've always waited to shampoo my brushes and that is sort of an ordeal. This cleaner is great because I can remove a color and the product doesn't irritate my eyes at all, which I was concerned about. It seems to be lasting a long time too. ",4
"I've always wanted to be able to wear red lipstick but every shade and brand I tried turned fuchsia or bright ORANGE on my lips. This is the only brand that I've tried that did not change color and I am now a red lipstick wearer!\nAlso, I enjoyed the fact that it stayed put and did not make a mess all over my teeth.",0
"I've been a fan of Jonathan since watching his show a few years ago. I was so excited to find his products at Sephora, and I have to say I love Dirt. It's the best styling product I've ever used. I have oily hair, but this doesn't add to the oily problem. It just keeps stray hairs in place and adds a smoothing effect. Love it! ",4
"I've been an on-again off-again UD user since the line first came out -- it was something of a disappointment when they phased out all of their fun gothy lip colors, but at least they still have a great range of unusual eyeshadows! The fliptop packaging with clear windows on the lids are a big improvement over the old plain metal tins, which could be hard to open, and the shadows are still as highly-pigmented and blendable as ever. Just be warned if you're looking at one of the glitter-heavy colors like Uzi...even with Primer Potion and spray makeup fixatives, they do tend to shed a few stray sparkles onto your cheekbones during wear! ",2
"i've been a user of all philosophy products for over 10 years. use this in the a.m. in the shower and purity in the p.m. to remove makeup and daily grime. i'm over 60 and my skin is devoid of wrinkles and looks better than most 40 year olds. also use hope in a jar, spf, peel and all amazing grace products plus many more.",4
"I've been frequenting Sephora looking for a great fragrance. I've been in a slump the past few years, just wearing scented lotions or body sprays...but I figured it was time for something better. My very patient SA suggested this. I'm very picky, and don't want to smell like a magazine. Often I'll find a fragrance I like, get it home, and halfway through the day want to shower it off because it just smells bad on me. I wasn't sure about this one at first when trying it in the store...but I took a sample and let it settle on me...and honestly, it is JUST what I've been looking for. For me, it's perfect! Very unique and highly recommended. ",0
"I've been looking for a great sunblock for my face since I had skin cancer that required skin grafts on my nose - this product works beautifully! It goes on smoothly, rubs right in, protects well and doesn't make me break out. I'll continue to use it to help prevent additional skin cancers. ",2
I've been looking for a high shine lip gloss that doesn't have gross tacky glitter chunks for a really long time. I'm a fan of big brand names and love all of Diors makeup. As soon as I saw this I bought it and now I'm totally in love. Best colors are jersey pink and red stockings. Don't complain about the price because if you want something high quality sometimes you have to pay a lot. ,0
"I've been looking for a lipstick like this for a while. It goes on smoothly and spreads easily. For a sheer-ish lipstick it stays on pretty well and leaves a bit of a stain behind. I purchased the color ""chic"" and it suits my skin tone to a t (it's a blue based red.) Don't let the color in the tube scare you,it isn't that dark and it certainly isn't hard lookng. I am extremely pleased with this product. P.S. For a bit more pop ,I sometimes put a little Guerlain ""cherry shine"" over it. Very nice ! ",4
"I've been looking for an eye-whitening pencil for several months now, and thought I'd found it with Cargo's EyeLighter. The truth is it just doesn't get under the bottom eyelid or in the corners of the eye. It just isn't soft enough to go on smoothly. ",4
"I've been looking for the perfect concealer all my life, and this product is one of the best. It provides excellent coverage for my very fair skin, and the lightest color doesn't have that icky yellow tone that many light concealers have. I gave this product only four stars because I don't need four of the five colors in the palette. ",4
I've been on a quest for the perfect mascara since i was probably 13 and i FINALLY found it thanks to the lash stash. it's awesome and it has different mascara and brushes for anyone. It's great especially if you are looking for volumizing mascara ,0
"I've been searching the market for years trying to find a staple scent for myself and have found none better than Hypnotic Poison. It's not the boring, plain-jane clean floral scents that asphyxiate department stores, oh no my friends. it's unique and sophisticated. it's a warm, nutty scent with an almond basenote and jasmine topnotes. it lasts for a really long time, too. i HIGHLY recommend it!!!",0
"I've been switching to natural skin care and cosmetics, and it's been difficult finding a lipstick I liked. I LOVE Korres and this lipstick is one of the reasons. It's creamy and emollient and the colors are just right. ",4
"I've been through every lip plumper on the market, never finding one that I loved. Until I tried Buxom Lips. I won't buy any other lip plumper ever again. It feels great, the colors are beautiful and I've gotten more comments on how great my lips look when I'm wearing it than with any other lip plumper. You just can't get better than that. Thanks Leslie and Bare Escentuals for such a great, and I do mean great, product!!",2
"I've been told by a Caudalie salesperson to mix with the elixir but why have to do that? The light color was an orange shade, patchy, and not mixed properly, by that I mean you get a bit on the top but when you squeeze it, watered down cream appears. They need to fix the colors rather than advise to mix with the elixir. The light is not light and the dark shade, which I've seen, is dark orange. What else can I say? It's horrible and they've made no attempt to fix it since it came out. ",2
"I've been trying them all -- natural, organic shampoos and conditioners, that is. So far, this is the best I've found. It has that reassuring sudsy sensation that is lost with most organics, a wonderful scent, and economy, too (a little does the job; most organics seems to ""take more""). The shampoo/conditioner duo will be permanently placed in my hair ritual. ",4
"I've been trying tinted moisturizers and light foundations for years. This is the one recommended by an associate in the store and it is the best coverage by far. I will stick with this one. After using primer this ""foundation"" covers perfectly. ",3
"I've been trying to move to more natural products, and I thought I'd try the Guava shower gel. It has a soft scent that makes me think of guavas with a nutty twist. I felt cleansed without feeling like my skin dried out. My only complaint is that it did not lather too well, so I had to use more than I use with other brands. ",1
"I've been using a sample of this product for 2 weeks. It really works. I've tried countless other products...Bobbi Brown, Stila, Sephora, etc. This is the only one that really does the job. I dab with my finger or a concealer brush and it does the trick.",2
"i've been using Lancome waterproof mascaras for years, but all that changed the day i started using this! it's everything they say it is and more! goes on great from day one -- something other products rarely do. what can i say? i'm a happy convert. (sorry Lancome) : )",4
I've been using mascara for over 45 years and this is the VERY best product that I've ever tried. Smoky Lash does everything is says and makes you feel like you've just put on false eyelashes --- without all the trouble. Thanks Make Up For Ever!!!!!,4
"I've been using the bare minerals for about a year now. My dermatologist told me I should be using them. Anyway, I tried them and love them. I just bought a new comtainer of the BE foundation and this one with the brush is a great deal. Either way though, I love this stuff!!!!! ",1
"I've been using the Boscia blotting linens for the last month, and I don't know why I didn't know about these before. I live in Texas where it's hot all the time and these beauties take away the shine in a heartbeat. Love them.",3
"I've been using the product for a few weeks now and haven't noticed much of a difference, except maybe lighter breakouts. I'm going to finish the bottle and see what happens, applying at morning and night. It's definately a light product and not over drying.",1
I've been using the Purity Made Simple for the last year and I will never stop!! This is an excellent product. I have a slight acne problem that comes up hear and there but since I've been using this face wash it's minimal. It also removes all my makeup with absolutely no residue and doesn't dry out my skin.,1
I've been using the regular bare escentuls full coverage foundation brush for years but ever since I purchased the Kabuki I can't go back to using my old brush. I am able to apply my minerals much faster with the Kabuki and it feels so soft on my skin!,1
"I've been using the Sephora Slim Lip Liners since I discovered them in Paris many years ago. Now, it seems that Sephora is slowing phasing them out. Come on girls ~ they are the best liner around and you can't beat the price. Let's tell Sephora that we want them back ~ with a full range of color options. ",4
I've been using this eye cream for about a year & will not use anything else. It is worth every penny! I've seen a big difference in lines around my eyes. No puffiness and in general just makes a huge difference. Nice texture also. Love Shiseido products.,4
I've been using this facial cleanser for about three years -- it's the only thing I've found that cleanses both the oily and drier parts of my combination facial skin without slicking it up or drying it out.,3
I've been using this faithfully since 2003 and wouldn't dream of using another foundation. After the first month or so of use a male friend asked me if I had done anything to my skin because it was so clear and smooth. My skin looks better everyday and it's so healthy looking. It's never caky so anyone who says that simply hasn't figured out how to apply it properly!,2
"I've been using this Firming concentrate on my decolletage, arms and stomach for about 6 months. It definitely works if you use it as directed. In the morning and at night. The only drawback is that it does take a bit to absorbs into your skin, but given that one can see results even without working out, one can't really complain. I always have an extra bottle handy to ensure continuity of usage. ",2
"I've been using this for about 6 years. It's easy to apply, gives a nice glow, moisturizes, doesn't go on dry or flaky & comes in a realisitc range of colors. It isn't a heavy coverage,..I'd have given it 5 stars if it sayed on longer. I like foundation to stay on all day. ",3
"I've been using this for about two years and love it. Though I switch to others for variety, it's still a staple. I find the colors to be soft with a hint of shimmer (very little). I also love the eco-friendly paper packaging :) ",4
"I've been using this for almost two weeks not and I can't say a whole lot about it because I haven't really noticed a huge difference. It's a good product because it doesn't irritate or break my skin out, it smells good, it glides on nice. For $80 I bet I can find something a little bit better. But overall its not a horrible product.",2
"I've been using this for years and it helps fight everything that attacks my hair: midwestern humidity, drying forced-air heat & air conditioning, and merciless flat ironing! It makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny with just the tiniest amount (about the size of a pea for shoulder-length hair), so the tube lasts forever. I've been on the same tube for almost a year, so it's also a great value. ",2
"I've been using this for years. I tried the mineral powders, but because my skin is not that sensitive, I really don't need them, but I loved their coverage. This product gives me that little ""extra"" without all the extra price. I still use the kabuki brush with it.",3
"I've been using this mascara since a friend turned me on to it about 5 yrs ago and it is the best I've used. It goes on clean, has the perfect brush (you can really separate and define your lashes), stays on great (no flaking or smudging), it's waterproof but does not feel hard on your lashes like other waterproof mascaras, you can build from light & natural to long & dramatic, & it's a beautiful glossy black. Love this product! Hope they never stop making it because I will continue to buy it. ",3
"I've been using this on my thighs, my derriere and stomach for about 6 months and I can honestly say that it works. However, this is a product that requires dedication. If you want to see results, you have to use it morning and night, and you do have to wait for it to absorb into your skin. However, I still gave it 5 stars because this works even if you don't work out. ",2
"I've been using this primer with bare minerals foundation for several months now. It really makes a difference in terms of the quality of the finish of my final makeup, as well as the ""smoothness"" factor. My pores are invisible with this stuff!!! Highly recommended.",2
I've been using this product for 2 weeks. I apply it twice daily (morning & night) and I have seen some change with the age spots on my hands getting lighter. They are still visible and I plan to continue using this product now and in the future to decrease my spots.,2
"I've been using this product for quite some time now - I find that it makes my foundation/concealer go a LONG way. Since it sets a perfect canvas for applying your foundation, it spreads it out evenly and I probably use 50% less foundation as a result. It smooths it on rather than caking it on.",0
"I've been using this remover every day for about three years now. It's super-gentle and that makes me feel good about poking it into the eye region. There's no Sephora in my town so whenever I travel I make sure to buy a couple of bottles to hold me over 'til the next time. Last stop was in Indianapolis, last week. This product used to come in the cutest little bottle. I liked it so much I saved one for posterity (see?). Silly me... ",3
I've been using this remover for a few weeks now. The directions state you only need half a pump to remove the Lash Injection mascaras. I use exactly that much two or three times in a row to get all the mascara off. I only apply one swipe of mascara --I'm not caking it on my lashes -- and yet their own remover can't get all the stuff off like they promise. I find it actually works better at cleaning the brushes and sponges that accompany the Too Faced eyeshadow. ,1
"I've been using this trial kit for a couple of weeks now and am still trying to find a good combination of this product and the products I was using previously on my dry skin. I do like the washing powder. It is a refreshing cleanser without drying out my skin and leaving it tight. But, I am still trying to find a good combination of a light moisturizer and the Skin Revival Treatment. I have very dry skin and am prone to wrinkles so I can't use the Skin Revival Treatment alone. I haven't decided if it will be a good product for me long term. ",4
"I've been waiting for a product like this. I don't often wear eye shadow, but I like having something to smooth out small veins and discoloration on my lids. This is easy to apply, covers well, wears well, and doesn't run or irritate my eyes. Yay! ",3
I've been weaing this perfume for the past 4 years and I never get bored with the scent. I've had SO MANY compliments from wearing this perfume from both men and women. It seems the men want to either buy it for their woman or they just stand there and sniff me and tell me how incredible I smell. People just seem to gravitate toward me because of this scent and I enjoy smelling this on myself too. I used to switch perfumes in the past but after wearing Light Blue I never even want to wear any other perfume. I LOVE LIGHT BLUE!,2
"I've ben using Rene Furterer products for two years. My hair had been falling out due to a lot of stress at the time. I occassionaly try other products, but will stay true to this brand because it saved my hair. ",3
I've bought cheap eye lash curlers over the years figuring it wasn't worth the money to buy a brand name one. I was wrong. This curler does what it's meant to do curl your lashes and not just flatten them out. I tossed the cheap ones out and will use shu uemura exclusively. ,3
"I've found all of the products in the Technician line of Fekkai do the same thing in that they work the first few times that they are used, then they just- don't. it's too bad, because they smell absolutely heavenly, and while they work, they make my hair stronger and silky. I have pretty picky hair, so I would still recommend them as their initial effect is wonderful, and they may work for you. ",2
"I've found most bronzers are either too brown or orange on me, but with this, I get a perfect shade of bronzer and blush. It's very SLIGHTLY lumious (PERFECT), and makes my face glow. Also, doesn't dry out my sensitive, dry skin, either. I mix two LIGHT swipes together, and add whichever color I need on top, for blush and bronzer. I find the color Berry/Chestnut best for mixing (my personal preference). If you get too much of one, it's easily lightned and blended in, with translucent powder (I use Makeup Forever). ",3
"I've got one streak of grey (think Morticia Addams) that is so stubborn to dye. I purchased the Dark Brown/Black and it does cover up the grey totally! This took several twists to get it for first time to start to come out. It's like hair dye that's very condensed into a thick thick paste. I just dabbed it in and brushed it through. The negative is it never seems to dry! :( So, if you touch your hair, you get brown dye on your hands. You have to make sure it's out of your hair before bed or it will rub on your pillow case. ",4
"I've had acne all my life and now I have hormonal acne at age 59. This moisturizer works wonders to keep my acne away. It is light, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly. I use the full Clinique Acne Solutions line and I'm SO glad I finally found a skin-care line that actually works!",4
"I've had my T3 dryer for a couple of years now, and I'm still in love. Let me put it this way: before I owned this dryer I NEVER would have stepped outside without using a flat iron after a blow out. With the T3, I can!! It smooths like no dryer I've ever owned before, it's quiet, it noticeably cut my drying time down, and it's lightweight. I admit it's pricey, but if you have long, thick, difficult-to-manage hair like mine, it's worth it. ",1
"I've had my T3 iron for a couple of years now. I swear that I sneeze and it's up to temperature--it's that fast. It gets nice and hot too, plus due to the temperature dial, you have total control over just how hot it gets. I would never use a flat iron without a wet-or-dry feature like this one has. Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic! ",1
"i've heard both good and bad about this mascara so i was pretty skeptical when i bought it. it does add length to lashes and the panormaic effect but it sort of leaves a residue-ish, racoon eye after i wear it for a few hours. It does the trick though. Dior is still my favorite. ",0
"I've heard wonderful things about Orgasm, I have it as well as Amour. Amour seems to fit my skin tone better, Orgasm makes a nice highlighter. Very pretty shades. Becoming my favorite powder blushes, though a bit too gray on my skin tone.",1
I've just recently feel in love with the NARS lipsticks. Many of the colors don't match what you see displayed online but inspite of that they are still great colors. They are very smooth and rich colors. And are moisturizing as long as you don't use a matte on already dry lips. I recommend this brand to anyone. Yes the brand is pricey but sometimes you have to pay to look good. They have many colors that are universally beautiful on all skin tones.,1
"I've just started using this product and I have to say I am really impressed and I expect great things from Ole! I haven't been using this product very long at all and already I have seen an actual difference in my skin. My face is soft, radiant, and happy! The smell is strong at first because of the DMAE, but it disapates quickly. I LOVE this product and I highly recommend it. Ole products are truly great products and as a bonus, they are generally cheaper than a lot of other brands that don't work nearly as well!!! ",1
"I've loved this fragrance ever since I got a free sample with an online order. I know that everyone's sniffer is different, but this gets a lot of compliments. The description of what kind of woman wears this perfume is a good one for the scent. I do have a sensitive nose, so I can't wear anything too sharp or strong. Please note that one or two strokes of this rollerball is plenty. I have overdone it before, and it doesn't take much to make this one last. If this helps you decide whether it's a scent you'll like, I also love Stella McCartney Stella, Issey Miyake L'Eau d'Issey, and Salvatore Ferragamo Incanto Shine. ",1
"I've never had a magnifying mirror, this one does the trick. I attached a thread to two of the suction cups as it hangs better where I use it. Otherwise, the pouch is nice because it keeps the mirror clean between uses. ",1
"I've never had such an eyelash curler before, and I've gone through many. This one curls my lashes and even after applying mascara, the curl stays, which is a result I was never able to achieve before. I was maybe expecting a tad bit more but I'll let you know right now it's my new favorite brand of curler. ",1
"I've never used an eyeshadow palette, but this was a great buy. The colors are rich and you don't need to pile it on your eye to get the color. If you use the eye primer by Urban Decay then the colors will really pop on your eyes. I love that some of the colors have almost like a hint of glitter and it can be worn day or night. ",0
"I've never used mineral makeup before but the video that comes with this kit is terrific. I was concerned that at my older age, minerals might look too dry on my skin. But I was pleasantly surprised because the Prime Time primer helps create a beautifully smooth finish. ",4
"I've now ordered 5 or 6 colors of this lipstick, including my second in Model Brown, which is a great neutral. Love how moisturizing these are, along with the extreme glossiness. Some lipsticks are hyped as super-glossy -- but fail to deliver on the lips. Dior Addict is truth in advertising! ",3
"I've only tried one shade and I love it, ""Orgsm"". It's neutral so I can wear it with alot of other different shades. Iit gives me a glow with out the glittery Iook. I even take this blush on the go with me because it blends so easily I can use my fingers.",1
"I've read all the hype about Nars ""o"" [the editor didn't like the color name] blush -- and figured it was just that, hype.\nWas I wrong! It is truly a transformative blush. The color is super-blendable, completely natural and gives you that ""life is good"" flush we are all trying to achieve. And given my lifestyle -- the lasting power is remarkable!\nThanks Nars and I'll take your word for it now!",2
"I've seen this advertised a lot, but just recently tried it out, and I have to say this is by far the perfume that I love the most! It smells so good, just right for me!! I'm only sorry I didn't discover it sooner!! ",1
"i've tried 2 of these and returned both, but only because i didn't like the colors on me. but overall i think the quality of the lipsticks is decent. the ones that i have gotten have been a little drying though.",1
"I've tried a couple primers and I wasn't really impressed. I have oily skin and the others didn't help much in that area, but this one has been great so far! The price is right too. And it makes a big difference in the look and staying power of my mineral powder foundation too. ",1
"I've tried almost every brand of primer known to mankind, but this product has finally ended my quest and saved me countless money in return shipping fees. LOVE< LOVE > LOVE it. Most primers are too greasy feeling or way to drying which when dry would pil and/or leave light, strange looking spots on my face. I have normal to dry skinand live in South Florida so I really needed a primer that can handle that horrible humidity. Highly recommend this. ",4
"I've tried a lot of different mascaras and this is the very best! I always get compliments on my lashes when I wear Supernova. I have rather light lashes that aren't particularly long, but this mascara adds volume, lengthens, and defines my lashes better than any other I've tried. I'll be a life-long user! ",1
"I've tried a lot of different types of powder-infused blotting papers. either they are so thin that they aren't substantial enough to do their job, or the powder on their surfaces crumbles and disappears into the bottom of my makeup bag. Sephora has taken a good thing and again, made it better. Blotting Film instantly removes shine; they are sturdy but soft, and no powdery mess! since they are colorless, I use them to blot any oil on my lids that is trying to smudge my eye makeup, and I don't disturb the color. excellent for hot or humid weather. these are a must for anyone who doesn't want to carry a pressed powder, but wants to control shine and keep their makeup application looking fresh. another winner from Sephora! ",2
"I've tried a lot of mascaras, and I thought I was in absolute love with Chanel's, but I decided to get this for the fake lashes for halloween. The brush is massive but by heavens its wonderful! The mascara comes off easily, my lashes are healthy, and it really makes my eyes pop when I put it on. ",0
"I've tried a multitude of concealers and have pretty much stuck with Cle de Peau. This covers just as well and is easier to use--creamy texture and nice delivery system. My only concern is how to tell when I'm running low and need to re-order. Otherwise, highly recommend. ",4
"I've tried every eyelash curler I could get my hands on, from drug store to department store. having the utmost respect for Kevyn Aucoin and his products, I decided to try his curler. the first time I used it on my stubby, flat lashes, it worked so much better than any other curler I had used that I over-curled my lashes! I was so used to squeezing and waiting for the curler to hold that I wasn't ready for the efficiency of his curler. this is NOT a product 'flaw' of this item, it is resounding praise! I had my first Aucoin lash curler for four years, and it performed wonderfully every time I used it. it makes your lashes mascara optional; great if you want a little boost for a 'no makeup' day of grocery shopping or errand running. and it magnifies the effect of your mascara by making your lashes seem lusher, so when you do use mascara, you get more performance from your product. I was so happy to see that my favorite store, Sephora, had begun carrying Kevyn Aucoin's wonderful products. please give this curler a try; you will not be disappointed. ",2
"I've tried every mascara I could get my hands on, including all seven in The Lash Stash kit, and none compares to this one. I have very fine lashes and this brush helps me coat all of them without looking cakey. It never flakes or smears.",1
I've tried everything for rough cuticles and this is the BEST !!! I Use it after doing dishes-have a tube right next to the dish soap. Put it on at bedtime and your hands will look great in the morning. ,4
I've tried every type of eyeliner - with a recent favorite being the gel liners. The Aqua Eyes are perfect - long lasting with terrific color - and EASY to apply. I've bought quite a few now and I love them all. Just wish they didn't need to be sharpened. Would prefer a roll-up. Highly recommend to anyone! ,4
"I've tried just about ALL types of makeup to help lessen the hereditary darkness under my eyes...and this was THE only thing that has worked wonders! I highly recommend to any girl of color (I'm Latina w/a bit of Arab mixed in)! I use a blend of the AMBER & MEDIUM! It stays on pretty much my entire work day. If I want to go out later on, I just dab on a smidgeon more & I'm good-2-go! LOVE IT! ",2
"I've tried lots of dry shampoos, and this is one of my favorites. The lemon smell is yum, and the nozzle is perfect for getting into your roots. Plus, it lasts FOREVER, and is pretty cheap, all things considered! ",1
"I've tried many blushes before and most of them give so much pigmented, it doesn't even look natural anymore! This is one of those hard to find blushes that may look dark at first, but when it goes onto the skin, there is just a beautiful natural looking flush on your cheeks. I'm a medium beige tone and I use Deep Throat.\nCons: None! Absolutely love it.",0
"I've tried other popular mineral foundations before, and this is my favorite so far. I love that it's quick and easy to put on in the mornings, because it's not messy like other loose powder foundations can be. ",0
"i've tried several other brands, but this is the only eye makeup remover I'll use. It does not irritate my sensitive eyes but still manages to remove every trace of eye makeup - even waterproof mascara.",2
"I've tried so many different masks, but this is by far the most unique and one of my favourites. My skin feels so soft and my complexion takes on a healthy glow. I'm not surprised to see that it's been voted a ""Best of Sephora"" product. ",1
I've tried so many products to help the dark splotch on my my face during pregnancy and it never went away. I've tried Ole's Sheer Transformation and it works pretty good but this worked so fast and to a much deeper level when used alone or with Sheer Transformation. I've used it a little over a week and can't believe that the ugly mark is almost too light to see! ,2
"I've tried some of the other lip wax products but they have a tendency to make my lips dry out and look sort of wrinkly. This one doesn't and stays smooth all day. The only complaint I have is that the brush fell apart almost immediately. I solved the problem by taking one of my old lip brushes and cutting the handle to fit into the case. Now Iit's perfect. I've bought this product for a few years, it's one of my old standbys. ",3
"I've tried them all, honeys; Lancome, Chanel, Stila, Estee Lauder, the much touted Cover Girl and Diorshow is hands down the best. One coat makes your lashes rock the day, several coats gets you sexy for the night. Love it, love it, love it. You will not be disappointed. ",1
"I've tried the Smashbox primer (sample) but decided to go with the less expensive Sephora brand. I think it works just as well--foundation goes on smoothly, stays put and the finish is a bit dewier than if I don't use primer at all. ",4
"I've tried too many make-up removers, & this is the best. It's not oily or heavy, but takes all the eye make-up off with just a few gentle swipes of my eyelids. It's the only one which even takes off waterproof mascara without having to rub your eyes for an eternity. I love BE products & this remover is another reason why. ",2
"I've tried using this brush many times for my blush, but it always comes out odd and I think that is because it lacks those tapered bristles around the edges. The flat head just doesn't work for me... or I can't make it work... that could be it. The quality is good, the bristles are soft and such, it just doesn't work with me. ",1
"I've used a couple primers before and I LOVE this one. First of all, because of the price. And second because of the way it makes my skin so smooth,dewy and soft I can go foundation-less if I want to! And when I do wear foundation, it stays on like a dream. Truly and excellent start to any face! ",0
"I've used almost all of my kit and it was a great purchase! The cat's eye took me a little practice, but after a couple of test runs with the eye makeup remover handy, I really liked the results. I've worn it with and without the retro look. Keep a wipe handy the first time you use it dry, though because you may have a little excess outside of the eye area. ",2
"ive used bare minerals for years but always used different lip colors. I am a big fan of lip venoms, but most on the market are really extreme. Once I tried Buxom, I've never turned back. This lip gloss is perfect, still kissable, and well worth the money.",0
I've used Dior before but this has to be one of their very BEST mascaras! Goes on so well and doesn't glop up on lashes or smear easily. It's stayed on through workouts and long days with no touch up needed and doesn't flake at all. Will definitely buy more and want to get some of the other colors. Plum is wonderful with my green eyes. Very subtle but everyone notices and asks what mascara I'm using so they can get some. ,3
I've used it for a year and won't go back to anything else. Unique scent immediately relaxes me when I go to wash my face. Rinses off easily and face feels fresh and clean but not dry and tight.\nI just love it!,4
"I've used Laura Mercier's oil-free cleanser on and off for over 10 years. I stopped using it for about 2 years after I moved to another state and the change in water and elements seemed to make the products I was using less effective. However, I had a horrible allergic reaction to a face wash a couple of months ago and thankfully had this on hand to use once I realized the new facial wash was the problem. It was wonderful to renew that old friendship and within hours of using it the redness and swelling I was experiencing began to subside. I happily purchased a full-sized version of this Laura Mercier facial wash and it is working great for me. It removes every trace of make up, no matter how waterproof and gently removes mascara as well. Now that I'm back to using my favorite facial wash again and it's working to its full effect, I'll be sticking with it for sure! If you try it, I can't imagine you'd be disappointed. ",2
"I've used many different cosmetic brands in the last four years. Wish I'd have started with Smashbox! I had noticed that their products were nearly always used on younger skin and felt it might not be for me as I entered my sixties. A mistake on my part! I love it, it does the same or maybe even more for me than anything else I've used. I found the Beauty Blockbuster - Mod Bag Set to be a wonderful value for the price. One can use many items in the Smashbox line that, perhaps, they've not used before. I'm very pleased with these products and with the value at Sephora! ",4
"I've used multiple creams, lotions, and oils with mixed results. Some just sat on the skin and some did nothing to hydrate for more than the 2 minutes it took to rub into my skin. This Lavender oil is an answer to my prayers! It hydates immediately, soaks into the skin with no ""greasy"" after use, and then to my amazement, no dry skin texture or dead cell flaking the next morning. I've recently purchased multiple ""OLE"" skin care products with very good results. I believe I may have finally found the perfect skincare line for me. ",3
I've used Nars lipsticks for a few years and love them! The colors are pure and bold and have staying power. They are smooth going on and I've never have had a problem with bleeding. Just when I think I've found the perfect Nars lip color they come up with a new one and you can't but help love their names!,2
"I've used Purity Made Simple for approx. 2 years and I've tried many products. I have sensitive skin and this is by far the best cleanser. Other cleansers are either way to harsh or it just simply doesn't do the job. This, however, is on a class of its own. It literally melts away your makeup. What i love about it the most is that it doesn't dry up my skin at all, and it removes all the dirt and grime from our routine day-to-day activities. I highly recommend it to everyone, esp. those with sensitive skin like me!",1
"I've used several dry shampoos (sprays), all of which had a particular smell that stuck with my hair through the day and which did a marginal job of degreasing my roots (I have VERY oily skin and scalp). Jade Blossom is a welcome change from that -- a very elegant scent that doesn't compete for attention. The texture is a little gritty. I didn't see (doesn't mean they're not there) instructions for brushing the powder through the hair, so I didn't ... next time I will, and I think I'll be happier. I will buy again. ",4
"I've used this for a while now (2 bottles) and I love it. I am picky about my cleansers because I want my skin to feel soft after washing and I want my cleanser to smell pleasant. I massage this in and then rinse with water and cloth, and my skins feels clean, soft, and nourished! ",3
"I've used this for several years, along with the other products in the Clinique 3 step system. It is pretty effective. Always liked that it leaves your skin feeling fresh & clean, without leaving any residue behind. I would definitely say this works best when used with the 3 step system, otherwise you risk having your skin feeling too tight.",1
"I've used this moisturizer off and on for the past few years. I wish it had an SPF version, and that's why I don't use it these days. It's really hydrating, unscented, and non-irritating on my sensitive skin. ",0
"I've used this product during the winter, and my skin eats up the oil. I take a bath or shower, and rub it all over my body. The best oil I've come across for my dry skin. The smell is sweetly scented-- try it!",1
"I've used this product twice now & have determined that I've got to try it by itself....meaning NOT in combination with any of my other frizz stopping/smoothing products. I'm hoping it will produce better results. As it was, it left my hair flat & dull and ""tacky"" feeling. ",2
"I've worn the same perfume (Perry Ellis 360) for about 20 years, and this is the only other scent I've purchased in that time. I originally tried the Amazing Grace shower products, then tried the Baby Grace shower gel and decided I love it so much more. I wanted the perfume because it's such a light, clean and fresh scent. While I won't wear it every day, it will be perfect for weekends and around the house, just for me! Now we just need a body and hand lotion! ",3
"I waited a long time before ordering Amazing Grace and what a huge mistake that was.\n\nWhat a lovely fragrance to use in the shower. The bathrooms in my house smell divine.\n\nIf you haven't given this product a try, take the plunge and place your order.",4
"I waited an eternity for this! It first showed in the early Fall catalog and everytime I tried to order it was out-of-stock. I happened to be in a Sephora store and there it was so I had to buy it! It has a very nice gloss without the stickiness and the color is not as intimidating as it might look. To get the really dark gothic appearance on the lips, you will need to use a dark brown or burgandy colored lip pencil. I can't say the brands per Sephora's request but you should be able to find a similar color with Smashbox or Nars. ",3
I wanted a blush not to look like a blush. My skin is old\nand my skin is yellow. This blush does not look like a blush and it does seem lke you just had one* (see the name)-why at my age!!! I look fabulous!!!,3
"I wanted some shine on a budget, so I bought the travel size. I'm glad I did because it made me thin hair look greasy instead of shiny. I think it would be good for girls with thicker hair, but not girls who struggle for volume like me. ",0
"I wanted this to work. Unfortunately, it does not work for me. Perhaps it might over time, but I was drawn to the word ""instant"" in the product description. My lines are very fine; it may be that it would work for someone whose lines are a little deeper. This one will gather dust for a while and then I'm sure I'll chuck it. ",4
"I wanted to love this, but it's missing that something special. It did give me some volume (no length) and it did have a nice finish (not dry or brittle). But it definitely didn't give me those va va voom lashes, or the thick, full fan that I've achieved with other products. Maybe it's the brush. My lashes tended to stick together. ",0
"I wanted to try these for the Gunshine shade alone. I mean, who has black lip gloss?? It's awesome and so are the rest of the colors. They give a nice color, but are still subtle with a hint of glitter. They smell yummy too! ",2
"I want this in a bigger size next time I order! Makes your hands SO soft and supple. he scent is delightful, not overwhelming or string, it's just right. I will be ordering this again! You cannot go wrong with BLISS products! ",3
"I was a a little hesitatant abut buying, and using all this powder, but actually it's a lot simpler than using liquid or cream foundation. It goes on so smoothtly and , my favorite product is well rested I have very dark circkle and nothing till now has covered them this well and looked so natural.this is a perfect starter kit since you get the brushes. Try it I think you will like it. Also a little goes a long way. ",4
"I was a big fan of mineral makeup but hated the shine I got.when using Bare Minerals. LG gives me good coverage, evens everything out and doesn't bother my rosacea. The blush is beautiful. I look healthy not greasy. Very happy! ",3
I was able to use these products only twice - I could not get past the fragrance. While I typically enjoy aromatherapy products - the scent of this set did not agree with me and made me nauseaus. I ended up exchanging the products for something else. ,2
"I was actually very happy with my tinted moisturizer until I got a sample of this one. It's so light and silky and my mineral makeup lays so smooth and naturally over it, that my skin looks and feels absolutely wonderful--like I'm not wearing makeup--also smooths out fine lines. ",3
I was a devoted carmex girl until I discovered this beauty staple. The soft vanilla scent is delightful..but it's the long-lasting moisturizing this lip balm provides that makes it a wonder. It heals even the most chapped lips and smooths them to perfection. I love it!! ,0
"I was a Lauren Hutton fan with her shading powder used with a Kabuki brush, however this product turned out excellent whether you use the sponge applicator or brush. Great for shading the deeper parts of the cheekbones as well as discuising the double chin! ",3
"I was a little disapointed in this mascara. I had really high hopes for it. It says that it is smudge/waterproof thats not really the case I always have little flakes of it in my eyes, in my opinion its not really worth the money and I usually love too faced! On the upside my eyelashes were darker and longer. ",0
"I was a little dissapointed on this one. Reviews were pretty good, but I didnt find it natural looking at all. The color was good but the texture was too thick and waxie. it made my brows stick to my face all flat.",3
"I was a little hesitant to try this product because I have VERY sensitive eyes and worried about other reviews that claimed stinging eyes, but the price was right compared to my normal product. I had absolutely no stinging or redness and this eye makeup remover worked great (better than the other brand). I will continue to use bare eyes from now on. ",3
"I was a little let down by this. It didn't moisturize as well as I expected. It smells delicious and if you don't have overly dry skin, you will probably be happy. But if you are dry like me, you might not be so happy. ",3
"I was a little scared to try this by myself the first time...I was used to only professionals using it on me. Once I got over it, I found it does a good job. It's easy to get carried away. Overall, a great tool. ",1
"I was a little skeptical about forking over the $40 for this product, but ... I like it. I've been using it only about 3 weeks, and I think I am starting to see a difference. Enough so that I will continue using and watching. I have very short, straight lashes that I curl, and I swear they are getting longer! ",3
"I was always curious about this product and finally got to try it after redeeming my BI points for a deluxe sample of this product.\n\nIt really does live up to its reputation and what everyone else says. It has a slight natural shimmer that is easily able to be applied with the wand. It is creamy and spreads and blends on nicely.\n\nBeing asian, I like to add a dab of this on the inner corner of my eyes oon the bottom part and blend it in. Definitely brightens and opens eyes up making it look bigger!",0
I was at my local sephora and and a national trainer for NARS happened to be there as well. She recommended Eros for me as I was looking for some new lipstick or gloss and found this to be a great color. I don't find the texture too sticky at all; it's really moisturizing to me! I also now want to try Hellfire and Chelsea Girls. Great product and does work well with or without the lipbrush. ,1
"I was blessed with good genes so my skin is pretty nice for being 51 but this product really does give me a nice bright glow. I love the smell of it too, got a sample months ago and still have some left. Very pricey but I will buy it, totally worth it. ",3
"I was compelled to write a review because of the fabulous products in this kit. The blush alone is worth the price of the kit! It gives you a natural ""glow"" like the movie stars have without the frosty glitter most blushes give you. The color was perfect. My BFF was in from out of town and tried it and she's pickier than me and loved it! Good to know is that she is olive complected and I am fair skinned so it is a great blush for anyone! Also the eye shadow is phenomenal. Just a light brush of the light beige will provide a natural looking base that also looks ""glowing"" not frosted and also does well with all skin tones. I am definitely putting DuWop on my ""favorites"" list this year. ",3
"I was concerned that at age 56, with crepey eyelids, that mineral makeup would not work for me. I was wrong. I use the eyelid primer and the minerals create a soft, natural look. I would prefer a little less gleem and more matte but the colors are still very becoming to me. ",4
"I was concerned that this would aggravate my combination skin, but not so! After having used this to the exclusion of all the toners I've purchased (and there have been many and most of them are very good), this one is now my favorite. I love that it's spray, portable, no cotton balls, no contamination of product. My skin feels very soft after using this. it absorbs quickly and nicely. I don't NEED a moisturizer afterward, though I will use one, especially if I'm going outdoors into windy or winter conditions. I can also see a difference with continued use. My skin glows! I would recommend this to anyone.",4
"I was curious about trying this and I'm glad I did. There are a couple of really great Tarte products that I just can't go without! This is really a compact size, the eyeshadow lasted all day and the matching liquid eyeliner is great. I really like this product and may have to order more in other colors!! ",2
"I was deciding between buying this and the bamboo box... I got them both anyway. I already have a few of these colors from other palettes but I couldn't resist... can't have enough Last Call. I like the brushes and travel Potion, too. Good deal. ",0
"I was disappointed at first upon receiving it because the shade is more of a light coppery bronzer-type than it looks in the picture. Once I swept it on my fair skinned face I was extremely pleased. It is a finely milled powder, so smooth and easy to control the amount of color that you apply I decided that it was a definite keeper. There is nothing artificial about the way it looks on your skin. It just imparts a lusterous wamth to your cheekbones or wherever the sun hits your face. Some skin colors may find it too light if they want to appear as if they just came from a tropical vacation but for us fair to light to medium complexions, I think you'd be very pleased. You can use it alone or with a blush and then apply this over it. The LM rep recommended this for me to use it as I just described. Best bronzer for us fair-light skined! ",4
"I was disappointed that the color is rather like a charcoal gray. I always use black. The eyeliner itself has a nice texture, BUT I HATE the applicator. It is also hard to get enough color on the applicator. I don't know what has happened to eye liner with a brush applicator, but I have tried tons of different ones, and they all have this hard end, like a Sharpie! It does make a very thin line............but then, I like a bit of a thicker line. I will not buy this again. ",4
"I was doubtful that this product would work overnight but it did, I hated to wash it out but even afterwards it was still amazing. Looked so vibrant and felt so soft. My only regret that this product is expensive or I would use it as often as I can. ",1
"I was dubious when I ordered this dryer that it would actually do everything T3 claimed it would. However, it is great. I do not see where there is a decrease in my drying time, but my hair is shiny, manageable, fuller, and smoother. My hair is fine and thin. I used this dryer on my dogs, and they were very, very fluffy and beautiful. My granddaughter has long, thick hair, and she LOVES THIS DRYER. Now, she wants me to buy her one--maybe for her June birthday. This tourmaline dryer lived up to all the claims. I'm glad I bought it. ",4
"I was excited about this gloss and was pretty satisfied with it. Really liked the subtle (not overly strong) cherry flavor and scent and it's not sticky. But, for some reason, it's still not my absolute favorite. Maybe the color was just not right for me? ",2
I was excited to purchase this mascara after hearing about it. I was very disappointed in the product. The brush is a dream but that is it. The formula must have multiple layers to get any kind of thickness. I am now using the Sephora brand and LOVE it. ,2
I was excited to receive this collection and couldn't wait to try it out. The first thing I learned was to keep my sense of humor. The silver is very rich and dark. I had to come up with a few tricks to tone it down so I wouldn't scare my son in the morning. I think I'll reserve this for night time festivities instead of everyday. ,1
"I was excited to try this but in spite of using all of the little ampoules and the toothpaste, my teeth are definitely not white. They are lighter in color but I was hoping for a more dazzling effect. One problem I kept having is accidentally using the refresher tubes instead of the main system tubes. I wish they had packed those into the silver case. The toothpaste tastes great-different than usual brands of mintiness. I ordered more of the followup whiteners to see if I can really polish up my act. ",4
"I was expecting big things from this product, so it was quite a let down. The smell was a little over powering and I found it hard to spray the back of my head right at the roots without missing any spots. Also, if you have really long, full hair, the can doesn't last long enough for the price you're paying. I'm thinking that the nonspray version would have been a better option. It may take longer to apply, but the results would probably be better. Then again, isn't the point of a dry shampoo speed and convenience? ",0
"I was expecting the same sponge tip makeup applicator that I've bought many times before. This one has a much smaller sponge tip, so I was a bit disappointed. The quality of the product is good, and it will get used, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. I hope they bring back the larger applicator. ",2
"I was expecting the tote bag to be green (judging by the photo), but it is a natural oatmeal color, very roomy and sturdy. The Stella roll-on is such a lovely fragrance, fits nicely into my handbag. I wasn't sure I would like the 5 Benefits Cream; I was afraid it would be too heavy. Not so! Very silky, nourishing, absorbs quickly. I wish it were infused with the Stella fragrance, but it has an ""au naturel"" scent. ",4
"I was expecting this to be a heavy cream, but it is not. It has a lovely silky feel, hydrating, and not greasy. The scent is ""au naturel"" and was a little unexpected, but is certainly not unpleasant and won't compete with your favorite fragrance. The bottle is larger than I expected and it takes so little product that I imagine this will last a long time, taking some of the price tag sting away. This came with the Stella tote bag (and it's full size), plus a Stella roll-on, making that purchase a bargain. ",4
I was extremely excited about a 4 day lash stain. This was a terrible product. It is difficult and messy to apply and impossible to remove. The brush makes the lashes clumpy and even if you wait until day 2 or 3 you cannot use an eyelash curler. I tried and ended up with 4 giant clumps of lash. All in all it is a big mess. ,1
"I was extremely impressed by this gloss -- I have used Dior Addict for a year, but this has it beat by a mile -- not sticky at all, keeps lips smooth (it is not drying like some glosses), and the color stays on for at least four hours (no fooling). I am gonna have to get more colors, because this one is a keeper!! ",2
"I was first disappointed by the size of the jar. At $20 a pop, that's kind of steep. Then I did not think it was an immediate wrinkle filler. I didn't expect a miracle, but I at least expected more. I probably would not buy this product again, although the Sepora brand has some good and inexpensive products. But, I think you need to go back to the drawing board on your Immediate Wrinkle Filler. Good Luck! I might even buy it again, if you improve it. ",4
"I was first dissappointed that they didn't come out with these colors over the summer that I searched high a low for. Second, the colors weren't as bold as I wanted because the formula for me was too sheer and I was expected something richer from Make Up Forever. I returned them. ",1
"I was first introduced to Too Faced because I passed by this kit at the store and did a double take, I thought, ""wow, all this for 39.50!!! DEAL"" I took it home and it was the best decision I ever made! I never imagined these products would be so fabulous. The bronzer has replaced all my others and become my favorite! The brush again, replaced many others and goes everywhere with me, the brush or bronzer alone is worth the price! The mascara replaced all my others! I loved it so much I bought a big one. Oh and the best thing ever is that the bronzer and brush are full size! It doesn't get any better than this! ",0
"I was given Roman Holiday as a gift. The colour was beautiful and it went on smoothly. While it is matte, it is also incredibly drying and doesn't last long at all. And after only a few uses, the pencil was completely dull. It was difficult and messy sharpening it. I won't be buying it.",0
"I was given this cleanser as a sample (at Sephora) and I absolutely loved it, I had to go back for more. It gently cleans while also not leaving your face dry. I have combination skin and this doesn't make me breakout or strip my face dry. Try it and you will love it. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.",1
"I was given this for my birthday as everyone knows me as a makeup junkie. I enjoyed playing with all the pretty colors of shadows and blushes, but the quality is not up to Sephora's brand. Nothing lasted on my face, especially on my eyes. The lipstick and glosses were dry. It's a good palette to experiment with but after you choose your colors--buy the better stuff. ",4
"I was happy to find that Sephora is carrying Shu Uemura. their products are all quite good but I love their lipsticks. the texture is smooth and the colors are beautiful. if you don't like lipstick to have a strong flavor or scent, try Shu's. there are colors for every makeup 'mood', but the colors in the softer range are perfect for lip minimalists [though they have great stronger tones as well.] I've found their formula to be lighter than a lot of other brands, and more on the translucent side, making them ideal for drier lips or anyone that prefers a moisturizing lipstick formula as opposed to a denser, more matte product. the colors stay true, and the packaging is quite nice, too. ",2
"I was hesitant to use a plumper on my lips. Normally I do not like the way they feel on my lips and I don't think you get a real change. This is great, looks great, doesn't make your lips feel like they may fall off, and best of all it actually plumps! I have the color sugar and it is great for day and night.",1
I wash every day with the shower gel!!! And follow it with the body emulsion. Layering these products give an all day wonderful smell. It refreshes itself through the day. It lathers with very little product.,4
"I wash my hair daily and this shampoo doesn't strip the oils or the color and my hair stays manageable. This shampoo lathers well in soft and hard water and rinses out easily. This is the first Korres product I've tried, but it won't be the last. ",3
"I was hooked on this product from day 1! As a rule, I dislike any dark or heavy lip color, so I love the way I can use any of these colors and they all end up looking totally natural on me; even the red (sexy)! For best results, I exfoliate my lips with a little sugar on a damp fingertip then dry and apply....three minutes to lips that rival Angelina's!!! I won't use anything else!! ",2
I was hoping for a better product. I purchase Bare Escentuals because I have been pleased with their products. This Magic Wand Brushless Mascare is not one of the better products. It clumps and does not go on smoothly. I have to go back with a brush and get rid of the clumps left behind. I would not purchase this again. ,4
"I was hoping this was going to be a great product to set my makeup, but the packaging is terrible. It comes out in one big squirt on one area of the face, doesn't dry quickly, and makes makeup run. I agree with others that if this was packaged in an aerosol can with a fine mist spray nozzle, it may work the way it is intended. As it is, this definitely is not worth the money or time spent fixing makeup that has run because of this product. ",1
I was in a Sephora store looking for a refillable powder brush that was advertised on a flier sent to my house. I bought refillable powder brush #54. I like it for a finishing powder brush. The powder does not come out very heavy to use with mineral powder foundation but it does work perfect for a finishing powder brush. I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a light powder finishing off your makeup. ,3
"I was initially afraid that this blush would be too peachy and not subtle enough for me, but it is PERFECT and deserves all of the raves. It looks quite natural (but better!),is translucent and just a bit shimmery, lasts all day, is very fine and silky in texture, and is the best color (Orgasm) for my porcelain/very pale pink undertone skin. This seems to somehow be a universal color, as people with many other skin colors/tones love it as much as I do. Other brands/colors have been okay, but this is GREAT. I've already purchased a second one for travel--don't want to be without this!",4
"I was introduced to the product before it hit the shelf in Sephora King of Prussia. I was so excited about the product and what it did for my face I stalked Sephora for 3 weeks. I purchased the product 10/6/08 ( and it was the last one). Being African American with uneven skin tone issues. IT WORKS. I have oily skin as well. It is the perfect foundation primer, moisturizer and facial treatment.I go to the gym everyday for lunch LOL and my make-up is flawless after my work-out.I just touch up with a little BE Minerial Veil and head back to the office. I'm a certified make-up junkie, but I think I've found my fix with this product. ",3
"I was leery of a powder-type undereye concealer, but this product is wonderful. It does a great job of hiding dark circles and really brightens up the eye area. The only complaint I had was not about the product itself, but that the sales associate pushed a shade on me that was not light enough, so it didn't do such a great job. But the Bisque shade is excellent for me.",4
"I was looking for a finely-milled face powder that blended naturally with my fair-light skin and I have found it. I shyed away from those powders that mentioned white and/or matte either in the product's description or by reviewers because I did not want to look like Casper the Ghost. I wanted a natural, airbrushed finish and whether on moisturized bare skin or as a finish to makeup this pwder is it! I got Delicate Beige 1 as I was afraid Delicate Beige 2, which is shown would be to dark for me. Perhaps in the summer, #2 will be appropriate. I apply it as the makeup artist recommended by shaking some into the palm of my hand and swirling my powder brush into it. then dusting it onto my face. It is invisible and no powdery look at all. Sheer Perfection!! ",4
"I was looking for a good paraben-free facial cleanser, and I picked this up in a store. It is great for my slightly oily skin, and after using it daily for a few weeks, my skin has definitely improved. I don't use the toner that they recommend, so I do have a little dryness afterwards if I don't moisturize, but that doesn't bother me too much (and it isn't very noticeable).",0
"I was looking for a more full cover make up and this is really only light to medium coverage. However, you can layer it to get more cover. Also, the color match is perfect. I did go to Sephora to test colors on my skin after first ordering online and having to return the wrong color and I found a perfect match. It really does blend well and it stays on all day. Not a foundation that you ""feel"" on your skin. I like it on days that I am having a ""good skin day"" and don't need full coverage! If you have naturally luminous, even skin, you will love this. ",3
I was looking for an eyeshadow to make my baby blue eyes pop and this one did it! Applied just under the eye brow also opens my eyes up and helps me look more rested. I love how I can blend several bareMinerals eyeshadows together on my lids to create a dramatic look for day or evening. And they don't feel heavy or irritating on my lids. They also don't crease or smudge. ,3
"I was looking for a really pretty gold eyeliner and bought this in Golden 6S. It's a soft, creamy eyeliner that is easy to apply without pulling on your skin and wears well. I love the gold shade especially when applied lightly in the inner corners of my eyes. ",0
"I was looking for a small purse spray to carry around and found this scent in such a size; it was wonderful! The scent is light and crisp, not overpowering at all, and it fits so nicely in any size purse! ",0
"i was looking for something more than a self tanner and came across this in Sephora. I tried some in the store and loved the way it made my legs and arms looked. Of course, i bought it and one night I was out and a woman commented, Your skin looks great, it has a glow to it. The great thing about the Tantalizer is it dries and does not go on clothing. This product makes your skin glow and gives it nice color. ",3
"I was looking for something to replace my first love, Laurence Dumont Vanille Bourbon, which was discontinued. This was recommended. It's not the same, but it is a pure vanilla fragrance. When I wear it, people will say they smell cotton candy or similar. Not quite what I was going for, but still nice. ",2
"I was not a big fan of cleaners that you have to wash off - call me lazy, but I preferred tissue off cleansers or face wipes as they tend to be better at getting all my makeup off.. Tried this stuff and I'm converted. Maybe I'm a sucker for the great Philosophy packaging, but I really enjoy using this cleanser and my skin feels and looks great afterwards. Even all my eyemakeup is completely removed after using this. Glad it comes in a big bottle as I'm mindful of the amount of wasteful packaging that comes with so many beauty products. Philosophy always keeps this to a minimum.",2
"I was not a person who thought she needed a primer for eyeshadow, was I wrong! This primer aborbs quickly and keeps you shadow on all day with no creasy! I just discoved this product and many more great products from Urban Decay!!! ",2
"I was not impressed by this product -- Lancome's cils booster works much better. The brush on this product makes application difficult as well -- unless the curve happens to fit your eyes perfectly, you will get product on your lids. ",2
"I was not very happy with this product. The brush is too stiff, and the color gel is too soft. I get a smudged mess when I try to apply it, and I am not new at eyeliner. I will most likely never use this product. ",4
I wasn't comfortable trying to create smoky eyes but this kit works well. I love both colors together or individually with other colors. The brush doesn't seem to be holding up well and isn't as soft as my other brushes. ,2
"I wasn't sure about this one when I ordered it, but thought it worth a shot. I've used this a couple of times now, and just the tiniest amount does the trick. The minty green neutralizes my dark circles nicely. I like this one a lot. ",4
"I wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I received Nars Orgasm but I've heard everyone else rave about it for a few years now and was feeling left out so I finally ordered some. This was my first Nars blush and I truly agree this is a universal shade that will flatter anyone. It has a very subtle amount of gold sheen, in fact I wouldn't mind if it were a bit more shimmery. It's beautiful peachy pink. I think it appears more peachy because of the golden flecks. I did not wear blush religiously before I received this and now I wear Orgasm everyday. Good pigmentation.",1
"I was on the search for the perfect eye cream for ME. Although, I wasn't necessarily looking for something that contains spf, I think I found my perfect match. I was a little skeptical of the fact that this does contain spf. Because, with spf there is always the reputation of the product going on too white and heavy or having that sunscreen scent. To my surprise this has none of that. I love that this goes on smooth it feels very light. It doesn't sit under my eyes and it doesn't give me that oily under eye area look, but it does keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized. It absorbs quickly and it doesn't irritate. I feel like it actually has brighten my under eyes and I had little fine lines (that only I can see) due to squinting in the Florida sun and it has helped with that too. And now I feel good that it actually does have the SPF to help me prevent future damages. ",1
"I was pleasantly surprised when I got this because I had no idea what it smelled like It is very femminie, light, and beautiful. If you like vanilla in your fragrance, then I would suggest this. I had no desire to send this back. I wear it about twice a week now and have gotten many compliments on it, even from other women. ",3
I was pleased with this mascara. I liked the fibers in the mascara. My lashes could use the help. I found it was easy to remove but I still needed a mascara remover before I washed my face; with that it was easy. I would purchase it again but it's not the best mascara I've ever used. ,4
"I was pretty excited when I picked this se up since I had read good reviews on it, but I have to say, the shades all kind of look the same on me. They are also very sticky. It is a good deal but I don't think I'll buy this product again. ",1
"I was pretty skeptical at first about using this concealer along with other acne products, since my skin is so sensitive. But I've (happily) discovered that it's not too harsh for my skin. It's a really nice compliment to the other Murad products, and since I don't usually wear foundation, the hint of color is perfect for me. I would definitely recommend it to Murad fans! ",0
"I was previously using a mineral powder makeup that was ""hand-crafted"" and supposed to be the best of the best. I started buying it when Bare Escentuals first came out. I read up on them all and decided that BE was probably over priced and that the same thing could be had for less.... so I did my online research and all these years I have been wrong. First off all my service from the other company is terrible and so that made me decide to try BE... so I got the Go Bare Kit after reading up on the rave reviews on Sephora. LOVE this stuff!!! This product is far and above superior. I have now ordered the full size blush (Golden Gate), the full size mineral veil (this is an unbelieveable necessity!), and the full size Lip Polish. The BE products are lite and flawless on every level. I have people telling me everyday how beautiful my skin looks! And it looks completely NATURAL!!! These powders are the finest of fine.... so you don't look powdered and you do not have the heavy liquid caked on look! The blush pairs perfectly with my skin... tho' I would not have quessed... it looks different in the little cup. The brushes are all quality brushes. I added all the samples to my purse makeup bag - brushes and makeup for touch ups and ordered full size for my morning makeup! The Buxom lip polishes are another new addiction... I just ordered the full set so I have an assortment of colors... love these!!! They do plumping, stay on and look great! I did miss that they did not include a foundation, but everything else was so perfect, I decided to order the foundation as well... so just went on and ordered that too! For reference sake... I tend to be very picky about my makeups. I NEVER buy grocery store products and only buy what dermatologists and estheticians recommend as quality products. The same goes for my mosturizers and hair products. ",3
"I was promised that this product would make it look as though I was wearing false eyelashes. I do not find it works quite as well as that, but after using Dior Show for years, I find this works a little better and is easier to put on. You can truly get every lash. ",2
"I was really excited about getting this product, but when I did it feel very short of what I thought it would do. I am not sure I have the right color, but even with that it did not cover my dark circles any different than products I already owned. I would like to return this one and try a different color, but I am still not sure it will work for me or anyone else with really dark circles.",1
"I was really hoping that the oil would really have a stronger smell and last a long time. This is my favorite of the grace's. I put it on this morning about 9 and by 11:30- also morning, I just couldn't smell this at all. You'd think since this is a perfume oil it would last a lot longer that it did. I was very disapointed to say the least. I just haven't decided wheather I will keep it or not since it didn't last any longer than it did. ",4
"I was really psyched about receiving this in the mail. But unfortunately, I had to return it. The color is a white clown makeup color, not flesh colored in the least. And when I applied it under my eye, it was drying and caused lines and bags to appear that weren't noticeable before. I applied it with a sponge, my finger and a brush, with no success. I love her cake eyeliner, but this product is not up to par. ",2
"I was reluctant to buy this because of the price, but I was glad I made the decision to do so. Nothing works quite as well as this cream; it makes my dry, thick, coarse hair much silkier and moisturized. Also like the smell. Love it! ",3
"I was skepitcal at first that this would not crease, but I have a really good primer (Urban Decay) so I figured that if it creased I'd just use the primer. I tested it out with no primer, and I am happy to say that 10 hours later, no creasing! And believe me, normal shadow with no primer creases within an hour for me. The colors are great, and it really does last! ",0
"i was skeptical about these pills at first cuz i didnt see a difference. after a couple weeks i noticed that my hair doesnt fall out as much and it doesnt feel as flat as before, i think it has a little more volume. my nails are still 100% as weak as they used to be though. ",0
"I was skeptical about this product.. usually do not have much luck with eye and cheek color, but this is incredible... simple to use, great natural coverage and colors. The blush is incredible, it actually works wonders for my olive skin tone. Lip color tingles a little, but the color is great! ",3
"I was skeptical. But I took the sample home from the Sephora store. The first night I dabbed a little on my nails. The next morning I noticed the difference. For a week I just dabbed a bit on at night. The I bought a tube. This is the best spend make-up money ever. My hands are soft, the nails are long and healthy, with no cuticles. I quit using nail polish because this cream makes my nails so beautiful I don't have to polish them. ",3
"I was skeptical that any product could make my light blonde hair look freshly washed and residue-free. However, Rene Furterer's dry shampoo delivers. It truly extends the life of a wash -- and it gets rid of cigarette smoke, which is next to impossible without several shampoos. ",1
"I was skeptic to try this as people either love it or hate it. I had to order several colors before I found the right one, so that is a downside (but it's the same as with ANY foundation or concealer you buy online--how can you be sure of the color??), but I ended up with the right color and returned the rest. I use it as a concealer and it is fabulous! I apply it how they say to (wish a brush, stippling it against the part I want to conceal on my face and then blending it in with the brush). It is THE BEST concealer I've ever used! I was a die-hard Vincent Longo Creme Concealer fan before, and although I still like it, the Kevyn Aucoin Sensual Skin Enhancer knocks its socks off! I haven't tried it as a foundation as I usually don't wear all-over foundation, but I imagine just smearing it on your face without diluting it with lotion would look silly or clown-ish. There's no such thing as a bad makeup product just because you can't apply it correctly! Bottom line, love it love it love it! ",0
I was so excited to get this product but was very disappointed. I have very oily skin and wanted a waterproof mascara that would not leave a raccoon effect and this product did not deliver. Only 1 hour after application I looked like Rocky Raccoon!!,4
"I was so excited to purchase these amazing looking colors, but I didn't love them as much as I thought I would. The shadows are kind of messy/crumbly and the colors don't go on as dark as the color looks. I guess putting on more works. But, they're still good colors and I'm glad to have them. ",1
"I was so excited to see this new formulation, and immediately ordered Stella. the color was not as deep as I was hoping, but it was still quite pretty. the only thing is the minty aspect of this gloss is too much for me. however, the colors are very nice and the shimmer is soft and very pretty. it is nicely moisturizing, as well. if you are a mint lover, these are for you. a nice generous amount in the component. ",2
"I was so excited to see Urban Decay brought back lipstick, and it does not disappoint! I totally love the coverage, although the color I bought, voodoo is definitely a sheer, it's a perfect shade. My one complaint is the knife sticking out of the bottom. I get it, but I miss the sleek, not so busy packaging of the old UD lipsticks. ",0
"I was so excited to use this product. I don't think it is black enough. The product is very heavy and goopy, application needs to be done carefully and focused. I have to use a tool to seperate my lashes before they dry. ",2
I was so excited when I smelled this perfume...so light....so fizzy....reminds me of 7-UP and Ginger Ale....Clean is the perfect frangrance for summer (though I might keep on wearing this throughout the winter as well)...,1
"i was so impressed i reviewed it as soon as i got it. it's the greatest idea. it is plenty of color, it doesn't dry your lips and great as a base coat under gloss, colored or not. i'll be getting every color. ",4
"I was sold on the philosophy Amazing Grace products when my sister bought me a gift set as a bridal shower present. As soon as I smelled this lotion, I knew I had finally found my signature scent. I love this lotion, because it really feels like it does something. Where other lotions just cover up your dryness, this lotion really sinks into the skin to do something about dryness. And the smell, it is so clean, so fresh and so unique. Wherever I go, people are always asking what I'm wearing because I smell so good. And I will never waste my money on any other imitators.",1
"I was so looking forward to this product but was disappointed that the spray is harsh with large drops; I spray holding the product far from my face but then have to""dry"" on the cool setting of my hairdryer; needs a very fine mist that dries right away; don't see any difference in makeup lasting longer ",3
I was surprised at how wonderful my skin looked when I used the Hybrid 2-1 luminizing primer in Flash. I am a faculty member at my city's community college. My make- up has to look great and natural all day long. This product works well all day. The photo op under eye brightener is another product I use everyday. I am so glad I tried this product. PS I learn some great tips from the DVD. ,4
"I was surprised by the size but a little does go a long way. In the winter I need a little more help but I think this will be perfect for the summer, especially when packing for beach weekends! Love the blush and eyeshadow. The lipgloss was a little too gold but again, with a tan I think it will look really nice. ",2
I was surprised that this concealer really works! It provides very good coverage and goes on easily. It covers the dark circles on my extremely fair skin. And finally I've found a concealer that is light in color but not too yellow. ,4
"I was surprised to find that this ""oil"" cleanser did not leave my comination skin feeling oily at all. It absolutely removed all makeup including waterproof eyeliner and regular mascara. I used a toner afterward and there was no residue left on the cotton ball. This stuff is great! ",3
"I was tentative about purchasing this product, but after I kept coming back to it everytime I went to sephora.com or the sephora store, I bit the bullet and purchased this intro kit! I couldn't be happier! First of all, I was a little taken back by the size of the containers, but worrie not! A little goes a long way!!! My face is baby smooth, and RADIANT!!!! Shiseido is a great line!!!! Since purchasing this product I have purchased the eye cream, and 55spf lotion and the ""Benefiance"" line for my mom along with a couple of products to complete her own routine! Again, great product! and A LITTLE DOES GO A LONG WAY!!!! ",0
"I was thrilled when I heard about the portable powder, but it's a little big carrying in the purse. I LOVE the product & keep this in my desk at work. I only use BE foundation & powder! I'ts the best. ",2
"I was thrilled when Photo Finish came out with the ""light"" version!! This product gives you the same results that the original Photo Finish Primer would, but it feels sheer and light! It absorbs fast and makes your skin more evenly toned for makeup.",1
"I was trying to save money and purchase the Sephora Brand eyeliner, however, I could never get it sharpened? It just kept breaking and I only got to use it two or three times and now it's gone - I sharpened it all away! It doesn't go on very smooth either - ",2
"I was under the impression when this product first came out, that it was going to be great. I was disappointed because it is very clumpy and did not stay on very well for me. It didn't make my lashes look any different than any other volumizing mascara, and for the price, it should have. ",1
"I was using the Kate Somerville Peptide Cream, but for half the price and with the ever effective sodium hyaluronate, I went back to Private Nurse. I alternate with this and my Retinol on weeks I am not on airplanes and this works wonderfully. Great stuff, will buy again. ",4
I was usually partial to powder foundation due to my oily skin. Cargo was the first I've tried in a liquid. I was so glad that they had so many colors to match every skin tone. I've never seen any liquid foundation go on and look so glowy! It's also lightweight and covers really well. Doesn't change color and doesn't look made up. ,2
"I was very disappointed in this product. I guess my circles are darker than most, but if I can I want to return it. I also felt it made lines under my eyes. If anyone knows of another brightener I would be interested to hear about it.",1
"I was very pleased with this lipstain...and would buy it again for sure. The only thing I don't like about it, is that you have to layer it a few times. So if you want a darker color on your lips, you have to reapply a few times & let it dry each time. It doesn't dry out your lips, but I didn't find it stained your lips for all that long. I had to reapply a few times thru the day...but overall was happy with this lip stain! ",1
"I was very skeptical about spending the money for this eyeshadow, because it was a bit pricier than what I was used to. But after using it I realized that the quality was incredible! The colors were beautiful and perfect and stayed on all day AND last forever! What I love about this color palate, is that one me (fair skin, freckled brunette) the shadow is incognito. I can wear it and look perfectly natural and simple while still making my eyes a focal point. It's really incredible. ",0
"I was very skeptical at first, but to my amazement it worked on me. My dark pigmentation faded & my overall face looks younger. I almost cannot believe it. I actually found the right stuff this time! Even if it does not completely make my pigmentation disappear, this I can live with happily. I am no longer self consious about my face. Thank you, Sephora for all your kind help.",2
i was very unimpressed with this. It didn't last very long at all - I was hoping that the bronze color especially would work for me but it just disappeared after a few hours. Maybe if you only needed it for an hour or so? ,3
I was waiting for BE to come out with something smaller and easier to carry and less messy than their first compact. I was so happy to receive this and find it easy to use and believe it can be refilled with no problem. It is also very stylish which is always a plus! ,3
"I was wearing this perfume when I first met my now-fiance. When we went on our first date, he asked what I had been wearing that night that we met. It was, of course, light blue! From there on, I wore it constantly. Two years later, he proposed with a tiffany ring. Coincidence? Perhaps, but I don't like to think so!\nEvery man I know says that this is the best scent for a woman to wear, hands down. It also doesn't get stale-smelling like some perfumes. In the winter, my scarves end up being perpetually light blue scented, because I don't wash them as often as my clothing, and they pick up the scent. The warmer, more vanilla-y notes come out.",0
"i was working a modeling gig for MAC's senior artists runwat workshop. After one of the artists had wiped off my makeup with a demiwipe, she sprayed Caudalie on my face. I loved it! Immediately after the workshop was over I went to Sephora where I had seen it sold and bought a bottle. I love it and use it everyday. It does everything it says it's supposed to! Smells amazing, wakes your senses and your skin up!",1
"I was worried I was purchasing a too large case. But it's fantastic and I organized my Bare Minerals makeup (of which I'm a big fan) and Bobbie Brown makeup (okay, I'm a big fan as well). Well worth the investment and it arrived quickly. Love the color. ",4
"I wear Amour, and find I don't need much to make an impact on my medium complexion, which is saying a lot. Not only do I NOT need to apply layers of it to get a great flush, it lasts all day, which I usually have a problem with when using other blushes.",1
"I wear lipstick during the day, but after it wears off or if my lips are dry, this is what I touch up with. It has just a hint of color, provides a nice shine, and is incredibly soft and smooth. On the weekends, it's great to wear alone. Plus I'm a sucker for the whimsical quotes on the packaging for all of Philosophy's products! I always carry this in my purse, and 1 tube lasted me 2 years. ",1
"I wear my hair up to work and this is the only product that works to control the wisps around my face that don't go back. If they insist on pointing the wrong way it really bugs me, but I don't like a lot of laquer-y stuff. My son likes the fragrance. Also, for my fine, straight hair, some on the ends before I put it up makes it take a nice curl by the end of the day. First rate. ",3
I wear Orgasm and find it to be a perfect compliment to my fair skin tone. It brightens up my face and gives me the perfect amount of color. It's not too shimmery and I can wear it in my very professional work environment.,0
"I wear powdered mineral foundation, have oily skin, but I need a little moisture underneath sometimes. I use this in place of moisturizer under my mineral foundation, and I think it helps it last longer because it gives it something to stick to besides just my bare skin. Plus this isn't oily and doesn't feel greasy. ",1
"I wear the peachy-pink blushes and I absolutely love them! They look so amazing and I have used the blush as eye shadow too if I was in a hurry. I kept it simple on the lips and what a pretty look it was. I can't wait to try the new color, Super O.",1
"I wear this all the time because my lashes are long but thin - this mascara boosts the volume up and makes them look thick and beautiful. Comes off easily with makeup remover and doesn't linger, but doesn't rub off during the day like some other mascaras. ",2
"I wear this almost everyday. It lasts for hours unlike most sweet smelling scents. It smells like a mix of chocolate, coconut, vanilla and the beach. Sounds strange I know, but really it works. I also wear Hanae Mori and Pink Sugar to give you examples of my taste, so if you like either, you should like this. ",1
"I wear this delectable scent and the compliments keep flowing all day long. My students, co workers and boyfriend all agree, this is a fantastic fragrance! They are all asking what are you wearing? It's Pink Sugar baby! A light sweet spritz that is not too sugary. If you are a vanilla fan looking for something new, this is for you.",1
"I wear this everyday, either under my foundation or under tinited moisturizer. Photo Finish keeps my makeup in place no matter what I'm doing - when at an outside event this summer, people kept asking why I wasn't sweating - my makeup was that fresh in spite of temperatures over 100 degrees. This is well worth the money.",2
"i went and talked to a consultant about finding a foundation and she used this one on me. It matched my skin tone sooo well, is light, blends perfectly, is buildable and is absolutely fantastic!! although it does have a funky odor to it, like a sour smell, but it goes away. i love it because it blends sooo easily, other times if you blend foundation with your fingers you can see harsh lines, but this one has no trouble at all!! ",0
"I went into my local sephora the other evening looking for a lipstick. I tried about 5 brands and a million colors and Laura's Brown Plum was the first one I tried and it was the only one I walked out the door with. It slid on like silk, felt light on my lips, and was very moisturizing. I love it and will certainly invest in more shades. ",0
I went in to Sephora looking for something to fill in my naturally sparse brows and the sales person chose this pencil and tested out 2 different colors on me. There wasn't much difference between the medium ash brown and the ultimate brown so I decided to go with the medium ash brown which was a little darker and more defined I used it this morning for the first time and it looks super natural and is fool-proof.. I really like this product! If you need help picking a color I would say go into the store and ask for help to find the best match,0
"I went into the store searching for that perfect shade of ""RED"" lipstick for those occasions you find yourself wanting to wear that seriously RED lipstick. I found it! I purchased the shade Dragon Girl & top it off with NARS Bloodwork lip gloss.\n\nPROS: Glides on like silk & so incredibly light! Absolutely no drying of the lips, which I feared. Also, ""NO"" feathering another one of my great fears ... esp with this color. Long lasting??? and then some. After being out on the town, drinking, dancing, chatting, etc... I only had to apply one coat of the lip gloss @ 2 am. Yea pretty impressed with this stuff! I am def. going to buy other shades of this product!!!\n\nCONS: NONE!!!",1
I went to every Lancome counter at every major department store before I found it that this gloss was only available on line or at the Summit store. The color is great because it's just barely there--just a hint. The right amount to compliment any complexion. ,2
"I went to my local Sephora store trying to find a new moisturizer. I have used Kinerase for years, (full line) though it is a good line...it is expensive ($117 moist.) and I wasn't seeing breakthrough results. They immediately suggested Perricone MD and this kit was available so I thought I would give it a try since it had 3 full sized products. The face firming lotion in the kit is.5 oz and is normally 1.7oz. The eye cream alone is $95 so this really is a great deal. I have to say I LOVE the product line so much that I am ordering another kit because it is such a great deal! My skin feels so soft. The cleanser removed all of my makeup and did not dry my skin at all which did happen with my Kinerase cleanser. Yes, the face firming activator has a funky smell, but not so bad that I can't use it. I am also looking into purchasing additional items from his skin care line because I am thrilled with his products. ",2
"I went to the Sephora store and found this, and would recommend it to others. I purchased ""praline"" and am very pleased. I feel pretty in it. And I am very picky!! It looks natural with a little punch. Apply the lip liner and let it set a second then fill in with the lighter color. Wow! Done just like a professional. ",2
"I will never be without this product again. Until I found this primer, my shadows wouldn't last more than a few hours without creasing, now, I can apply shadow in the morning, then go to work that night, work 12 hours, and it will still look perfect the next morning-more than 24 hours later! ",2
"I wish I could keep this a secret. Everyone tells me my skin is absolutely gorgeous . not a pore in sight , just a flawless look of absolute perfection . I can't be without my Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch .. Shh , don't tell .",4
I wish I had purchased the deep. I may exchange it is a little too light for my skin tone. Others have disliked the dryness of this but I like it. Try to apply with a small foundation brush for a more even application! ,1
"I wish some of these reviews were here when I bought it. It is flakey, thin, and does not last four days. Yes, you have some of it on the next day, and it is a giant pain to try to get what is there off, but you cannot go out with half painted lashes. ",3
I wondered when Bare Minerals would finally come out with something like this. What a great concept! Easy to carry and easy to use. I can stay shine free and smooth all day with Mineral Veil on the Go. ,3
i wore urban decay liner and it was great on top lid but smeared on the bottom lashes. THIS STUFF DOES NOT MOVE. i luv luv luv it.. i am a redhead and always used black pencils in the past. the purple with pink and mauve eyeshadows make my eyes pop and never look like they belong to a raccoon. try any color.....you willl luv it. ,4
"I wore victoria by victoria secret for years until they quit making it and I have not found a replacement that I really liked until now. Flower by kenzo is wonderful. It is subtle, sexy, and alluring to young and old alike. People have been asking what I am wearing and where did I get it. It actually came as an Insider sample. The price is also incredible. It smells like rich velvet feels. ",4
"I work 12 hour shifts, and this looks as if I just put it on when I get home. I can go to the gym after work and it doesn't budge. I love the shimmer in gunmetal, it's a great alternative to solid black.",0
I work as an oncology nurse in a very busy clinic. No time for makeup touch ups. What I put on in the morning needs to last all day. Benetint fills the bill for me. Thanks for such a wonderful product.,4
"I work at a day spa and we use this product on alot of our clients and they love this masque! It's a wonderful masque to use after peels, extractions or if I wake up and my undereyes are a little puffy i apply a little on them in the morning leave it on for a few minutes and rinse off. I use it once weekly. It is important to stick with only using a facial masque once a week. while you can never get enough of the relaxation benefits that come with using a face masque, your skin does. overusing a face masque can strip your skin of neccessary oil. in turn, your skin overcompensates by creating too much oil, making it look even worse. so unless the directions on the masque say its okay, refrain from using a facial masque more than once a week to get the best benefits possible for your skin. ",0
"I work extremely early and I am always in a hurry, so I don't always have time to use my favorite tweezers, but I still want to look nice. Therefore, I groom my eyebrows and upper lip every morning with these razors! In just a few strokes, it looks like I just had my eyebrows and lip waxed (without the irritation and redness). The razors are very sharp, so my face always looks very smooth, yet it has a protective layer over the blades to prevent nicks and cuts on my very sensitive skin!",1
"I work in a very warm, humid environment that is just determined to aggravate my rosacea. I also have skin that breaks out at the very mention of sunscreen which is a MUST in FL!\nI just turned 26 and noticed that the flushing had really become permanent (people always asked if I have a sunburn) and that I must do something to reduce it!\nI got the Redness Solutions Redness Regimen from Clinique (Cleanser, Relief Cream, Protective Base) and they all work together to reduce the redness and hydrate the skin.\nIt will take time (around a month) but the overall feeling of my dry, scaly cheek skin has given way to smooth, calm skin. The skin in the top of my cheeks is now very comfortable and while I'm still pink it doesn't have that sunburn color. (it might also help if I did it every day like I am supposed to)\nI'm sure that over time I will see additional improvements. I have fair olive skin and If I blend the base well, i don't even bother with putting anything over it. And the base includes SPF 15 which doesn't break me out, it is possible!!!",1
I would definitely purchase this body butter again. I believe that for the money it's probably one of the best body butters on the market. I apply it after my morning shower and it keeps my skin moist all day. It has a pleasant smell but not overpowering. ,4
"i would describe the product as very pretty. It really is basically a glitter, so i recommend wearing your normal eyeshadow underneath it-that's the key. If you do that, it will really enhance the eye shadow and take it to a new level. It's a little messy. You get a lot of shadow because you use such a small amount at a time so it's a pretty good value. ",0
"I would give it 5 stars but Oscar Blandi needs to come up with a dry shampoo for brunettes. I works really well, my hair looks smooth, clean and I love the fragrance but I have to be very careful not to apply much on the roots (it's where I need it the most!) otherwise looks like I have baby powder on it!. My sister is blond and she loves it! One word O.Blandi: brunettes. ",2
"I would have gave UDPP 5 stars if it wasn't for the tube that the product comes in. The only way you can get the most bang for your buck is if you're willing to break the tube open. BUT...the product is great!!!!!! It brings out the color of your eyeshadow, eliminates the crease, and makes blending eyeshadow a breeeze. ",1
I would have to say despite it being on the verge of sticky this is a really pretty gloss. The color sets very naturally and thats because I'm not a pink loving person. It looks like theres no color to it at all when I put it on. A plus is one tube will last forever. ,0
"I would have totally given this shadow 5 stars. but mine cracked! It dropped from my hand on to my vanity [a 3 inch drop] and didn't survive, it's still a great shadow. The color payoff is outstanding. I recommend thunder ball for a smokey eye. ",0
"I would like something more moisturizing, but no longer am able to use products in jars (dermatologist said nothing I have to dip my fingers into, only tubes and pumps). As tube products go, this is a good one. ",4
"I would not know what to do with this highlighter unless I had the wonderful fella at the Sephora in Austin show me how (and why) highlighter can make you look ""candlelit"". I strongly recommend this for evening or date night and to also get smart on how to apply and where. He was very specific when he demonstrated on me and I have had COMPLIMENTS about how lovely I look when I do it! Not a day look though... although, it can be used as a highlighter eye shadow during the day! ",2
"I wouldnt even give this 1 star. Does not work, still leaves stubble on legs and doesnt work at all on thicker hair areas at all (underarms, bikini). It took 2 hours on one leg and still did not get the results i was expecting. Sephora kindly refunded me with no questions asked. ",0
"I wouldn't recommend it as a shampoo if your hair is spazzy, as mine is. It made my hair a little dry. But as a body wash, it rules, and smells awesome (I may even like it a little better than amazing grace!)",1
"I would probably continue to use this just for the smell alone. I haven't noticed any difference in the amount of curls or frizz I have, but this suds up nicely and leaves hair clean and moisturized. I still use it every day even though Fekkai says to wash curly hair at the most every other day. I just can't get by that way. ",1
"I would reccomend this product to anyone that wants to enhance or lighten their eyeborws. I have really dark eye brows, and the brunette shade really helped in highlighting them, while still looking natural. It also helped them appear fuller. It was a little tricky to put on, but I still liked the finished look.",0
"I would recommend (and have) this product to EVERYONE! I love how everything comes together and is explained how to apply it. It looks great, totally natural and is so easy! and its a totally good value ",0
"I wrote a review here a few weeks ago saying that I didn't think that Pores No More was worth it. Now, after a few weeks of using the product, I think it's a good buy, and it works. I have lots of large pores on my nose and using this product, along with Bare Minerals blemish healing powder, seems to work well. At least it's as good as I've had it for most of my life. I like this product, and though I wish it would work better, it seems to work as well as is possible for my situation.",4
"Jean Paul Gaultier's fragrances can be quirky. This one is no exception: Fleur du Male is the closest you'll get to wearing soap without eating a bar of Irish Spring. Five stars for originality... it's fun to wear, and definitely not for the faint at heart. ",0
"Jungle Red has been a staple in my makeup bag for years. loaded with pigment, Nars Lipliner Pencil holds in lip color admirably. the formula is a tiny bit on the 'dry' side in that it does not glide on like a waterproof pencil. regardless, it stays put, and the colors are highly pigmented. a great lip liner. ",2
Just a little goes a long way. It give you a glow and radiant look with just a tab on the brush. I love it. and the glow isn't a glitter glow like most of the others. But don't use too much or it will look supper fake ,0
Just a skinny skinny swipe of glittery shimmer is really subtle and so effective for a finished look. It's not too sticky or dense and with the perfect skinny brush it's totally controllable. GO GRAZY and get one in every color!!,3
"Just got back from Baja and used this cream on the trip. Although it is extremely hot there and humid in Baja this time of the year, Renergie cream left a soft non-greasy feeling to my skin and kept it well hydrated too. For someone in their 50's or 60's, I think you'll like this product. ",4
Just got to have this stuff. I use it for leave in conditioning though do not apply to my scalp. Also use it to restyle my hair on day #2. My hair is chemically treated and my stylist had to know why my hair looks so luminous and maintains a healthy texture. Of course the aroma of this mist is just heaven!! ,3
"Just have to say, quoting my hairdresser regarding the amount of hair I had after a period of illness and medication: Before: ""Oh, my what's wrong"" - After: ""You've got some serious hair there!"" Wonderful product! ",4
Just love the scent of this lotion. I am told constantly that I smell great....comments such as you smell so clean and what is that you're wearing I want to get some. DOn;t leave the house with out it!,3
"just love this product,as i am olive skinned,it gives me a boost to my skin color specially in the summer.I use it all year round,no mistake as one can see where one is applying it with the cotton ball.Best of all the product doesnt have any offenssive smell as most self tanner do.Thank you clarins and thank you sephora for carrying this product.online.As I dont have to go to the store to buy it ,i can order online. ",4
"Just tested this in the store on my lunch break because of the previous reviews, and I must say I'm very impressed. It's excellent for combination skin. It covered my imperfections very well, but is still very natural looking... even in the glaring light of day! It's matte without looking cakey and has kept the oily shine away all day. The only disadvantage of the Korres line is the limited selection of colors. ",2
keep using it !!!! when I first started using it i really didnt like it to be honest... I found it didnt really do much for me but now its the only mascara I use! I would love it even more if they came out with a waterproof version ....,0
Kind of OK but waaaay too much $$ for the results. Can I say that Caudalie makes something for eyes and lips that works better for me? It does. I don't know what on earth Bliss is talking about when it says it will diminish the 'stache. That never happened for me. ,3
"Kinerase is one of the pricier moisterizers on the market but is worth every single penny. I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out and have never experienced any problems with this produce and have been using it for almost 2 years. In fact, I've tried other products and always end up coming back to Kinerase lotion. Since I've started using this product, my skin has never looked better -- I look at least 5 years younger than I used to. This product also lasts a long time - a tube should last at least 6 months. Again - worth every penny. Your skin is an investment. ",2
"Klorane dry shampoo is unbelievable! I couldn't wash my hair for 4 days, but by Day 3, I was going crazy because my hair was so oily. I applied the Klorane, waited 2 minutes, brushed out my hair, and it looked as though I'd washed and styled my hair. I highly recommend this for anyone who needs to shampoo in a pinch. It's great for travel and you can carry it on because it's not a liquid. ",2
"Knowing that my old curler was nearing the end of its usefulness, I spent a couple of months researching eyelash curlers and contemplating the insane idea of spending more than $5 or $6 on a new one. My old one finally gave out and I gave in and purchased this one from Shiseido. It works with half the effort of all my former curlers. It does not pinch and fits the curve of my eyelid perfectly. It does a wonderful job and I am glad I purchased it. ",3
"Korres has combined the best of three worlds with a luxurious body wash, a moisture plus body butter and a luchious lip balm. I have purchased other pricey products to keep my mature, over worked skin soft and supple. With Korres, I have achieved superior results, at less than half the price. A wonderful value. I live in S. Florida and my skin is subject to sun and salt. The body butter is wonderful and when applied after my a.m. shower, my skin remains moist for the rest ofthe day. I apply the lip balm day and night and it has helped reduce the fine aging lines. II thank Korres for creating a wonderful product and for offering such a great trio at a great price. ",4
"Kudos to Clinque for providing us workout freaks with a sweat-resistant foundation. (need to wear one even during workouts due to loss of pigmentation from laser). Stays with you during a sweat, yet comes off easily with cleanser. Would like to see more shades offered, with less yellow base. ",4
"Ladies, if you like to wear lip gloss then you will love this product. I have very full lips, so plumping is not an issue, however, it still works on me as a plumper. My lips look voluptuous and sexy when I wear it. I tend to use more nude/neutral tones on my lips and the color Dolly is perfect. It gives a refreshing feeling as well, it wakes up your lips, like coffee wakes your brain.",1
"Ladies, I have tried them all and this mascara is the best. No smudges, no raccoon eyes after an hour or even 10 hours. My lashes are long and dark and oh so lush!!! Thank you Dior for the best mascara ever! ",3
"Lancome's Double Action Eye Makeup Remover works like a charm. It removes stubborn waterproof mascara with ease and no hard rubbing required. I have very sensitive eyes and this doesn't irritate or cause tearing. Also, no more blurry eyes with this makeup remover. Very nice.",2
"Last night my boyfriend got this for me and it is the cutiest little gift. I'm suprised that it does not come with any brushes but I really like the lip gloss, you can actually put it on. I have a sephora similiar one (much bigger one though) and all the lip glosses you simply cannot put it on so I like this much better. ",0
"Last Xmas my cousin suprised me with this. Of course, makeup...I am happy! A lot of variety of colors to choose from, fun to play around with...make sure to wear eye primer so it will last all day since you can't carry this with you. My only complaint is all the pallettes for the lips...very dry, very hard to apply. ",0
"Laura Geller's Face Folio is a must-have! The palette is neutral enough to fit any face, but you can find fun ways to combine and jazz it up! The 2 compacts come cozily contained in one neat-&-tidy wallet. The products are easy to use (tres facile!!!), the size slips into any purse or satchel making it great for travel, and the price makes it practically a gift! Geller's Face Folio is one of my favorite finds! ",3
"Laura Geller's heal and seal lip gloss does just that...it keeps lips from getting chapped and gives my lipstick a nice long-lasting glossy shine when worn overtop. The tube makes carrying in your purse a cinch, too. Excellent lip gloss! ",2
"Laura Geller's Spackle is a great product. It goes on easly and feels so good to my skin. It evens out my skin texture and makes the application of my make up so much easier. And my skin looks good all day long, with very little touch up. I love this product ! ",3
Laura Mercier's 'Audrey' lispstick is the perfect shade if you're fair skinned with reddish-brown hair and green eyes. The rose-brown shade is a medium intensity and very creamy in texture. Just wish it lasted longer on the lips! ,3
"Laura Mercier's Eye Colour Trio is marvelous! Laura Mercier's eyeshadows are absolutely awesome...highly pigmented, crease resistent, blendable, smudgable, glide on softly and smoothly and they are long lasting, too. The three shades in this compact coordinate beautifully together. It takes the guesswork out of what colors to wear together...it's been done for you already in this trio. Great product! ",2
Laura Mercier's mineral finishing powder is very sheer...as a matter of fact it is too sheer for me. I like a setting powder that provides a small amount of color and coverage. This powder is too finely milled for my taste. ,2
"Layerable, pinkbased, lightly shimmery, long lasting powder blush. What more can you ask for? I use this in my kit and my teacher just fell in love with O. I am lighter so i use deep throat, but I plan on getting Dolce Vita and maybe one of the ligher ones for a highlighter. This formula isn't streaky or makeupy unless you really try to make it so.",0
"leaves my thick hair clean and soft. it is exactly what it is named ""gentle"". when you have very thick hair, it's hard to find a good cleansing shampoo that will thoroughly clean your hair, but not strip it. ",3
"left my hair feeling very dry. lathers well but i hated how it left my hair feeling, like straw. would not recommend to anyone not even with oily hair, cause i have oily hair and it still left it feeling like crud ",1
Left this as a thank you when I visited a friend. She really liked it. Her husband also liked the scent on his wife. Plus I did not have to remember to write a thank you not when I got home. Just jotted down a couple of thoughts on the lines provided. ,3
"Lengthens, volumizes, and leaves your lashes curled if you pull up as you apply it. The dark color is great also. It's easy to wash off, which is another plus. Natural, yet dramatic look at the same time. ",1
Leslie does it again! I'm totally addicted to Buxom Babes lip gloss!!! I have almost all the colors and I want more. They really do plump your lips up but aren't sticky or weird feeling on your lips. These four also smell great!!! These are also very sheer so you don't get dense color on your lips when applying these. They're also small enough to go in a really small clutch. ,3
"Let me be clear, these does not ""brush"" your teeth. However, they are very effective at freshening my breath and giving my teeth a good once-over. I travel frequently for work, give presentations, lead meetings, and conduct training sessions, all of which tend to give me a dry mouth and sometimes not-so-fresh breath. Go Smile Touch Ups solve both problems, and I have given them to co-workers who have liked them as well. The portability is a huge plus, they don't take up much room in that pesky quart-size bag for airline travel. ",3
"Let me first say that I don't use this all over my face. I have combination skin and there are areas that just plain don't need moisture. However, my eye area dries out very quickly and I use this lotion to take of my makeup. It takes it off beautifully and also moisturizes my eye area! I usually get it free with Clinique's GWP's but never hesistate to purchase the bottle if I run out, because it lasts forever. ",0
"Let me just say that after years of doing liquid liner, I am pretty much a pro! but I could not stand the brush on this product! it flopped around everywhere and it was nearly impossible to do a thin straight line! but the colors r fabulous! and incredibly long lasting! ",0
"Let me say for function, this is outstanding as a shadow base, and I've already recommended it to friends for that purpose. However, my eyes are sensitive, and I just can't wear this product because of it. ",2
"Let me say this. I was tempted to lick my wrist after spraying. It is not flavored the way it smells, maybe to prevent this behavior. It is one of my all-time favorite scents. Funny, when I wear it people tend to call me sugar.....",1
"let me start by saying how much i love sephora & almost all of the products i have tried from them ( & that is many, many products). with this set - the beauty elixir was horrible!! it smells like medicine & the smell burned my eyes for hours just from spraying it on my skin (afterall, it's meant to be sprayed on the face). the day & nite moisterizers were way too heavy & thick. they come in tiny tubes & don't spread well, so i know it wouldn't have lasted very long. not worth the price. the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because the serum really did give a nice, healthy glow to my skin, but the glow disappears after you wash your face at night. i can get that with a tinted moisterizer for a lot less $. i was looking for something that would help make my skin glow from having healthy skin, not from just sitting on top of my skin. ",3
"LET ME START BY SAYING I DO NOT , DO NOT, DO NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL MINERAL VEIL!!! SO I WAS VERY HESITANT TO TRY THIS ONE. BUT I DID...... AND................I LOVE IT. IT FEELS VERY LIGHT AND COOLING ON THE FACE AND THE BRUSH IS LUXURIOUS, SUPER SOFT ( BEST B.E BRUSH SO FAR). I HAVE AN OILY T ZONE AND TO MY SURPRISE THIS WORKS GREAT AND MY FRIEND HAS DRY SKIN AND HAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT COMPLEXION, THEN ME ....SHE LOVES IT TOO!! WE BOTH TRIED IT AND BOUGHT IT ON OUR LITTLE MOMMY TIME ALONE @ THE MALL TRIP. THIS IS A MUST TRY ESPECIALLY THOSE OUT THERE WHO DONT LIKE MINERAL VEIL. THIS MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL DIFFERENT ABOUT IT. (THIS FORMULA IS GREAT) ",1
"Let me start by saying that I am super picky when it comes to my mascara. I have long, but thin, blond eyelashes. This product didn't do anything bad to them, but didn't do anything amazing either. It didn't leave them stiff and brittle, but did leave them feeling rather dry. It gave them decent volume and good length, but nothing show stopping. It also dried up fairly quickly in the tube. I liked the effect of the big brush, although it does make it trickier to use without getting mascara where you don't want it. Not awful, but not great. ",0
Light Blue is my favorite perfume. I have many others that were twice the price but I always come back to Light Blue. It is not overwhelming. It has a very clean scent. This is great as a daytime fragrance.,1
Like all Dior makeup this is a quality product. It gives me a nice finished look without being heavy and is quick to apply. I use a primer underneath and it lasts all day even with my slightly oily skin. Elegant packaging and nicely portable for touchups. Can also use as a pressed powder over liquid foundation. I do NOT have perfect skin by any means but this gives me enough coverage without feeling or looking heavy. worth the money! ,3
like all Gwen S. fragrences this one smells cheap too ..... the LAMB smelled like pledge furniture cleaner... the G smells like cheap coconut car airfreshner .. the baby smells like loves baby soft... etc... they all smell cheap..... not worth the money at all ,1
"Like all of their products, Mineral Veil does not disappoint. I chose the clear so as to not change the color of my foundation choice. But I will also order the shimmery one for evenings. A MUST HAVE!!!!",4
"Like all the nars blushes,Amour is sheer,light and layerable. In short ,the perfect blush. I also have Orgasm and this color is just a tiny bit darker. It does not have any shimmer and is a good alternative or partner to Orgasm.",4
like i didn't want to spend that much on something i wasnt sure f it would work but it does. i like it sure i could have got the regular color but ...... so anyways it was nice that it had a replacement pad with it. ,0
Like so many others - I love this cleanser! I can't live without it. It's so gentle. You won't need a separate make-up remover for your eye make-up. Use it all over - it's as gentle as water. And it leaves your skin squeaky clean without drying it out. It's simply perfect!,1
"Like the applicator (no more messy fingers), covers well and is not too sticky/tacky like most concealers are that seem to stretch the delicate eye area. I use a cosmetic sponge to blend and it works great. No touch ups required (seems to last all day in the AZ heat). ",3
"Like the Bliss FatGirlSlim, this product did not work.I didn't have high expectations for this, but it was still quite disappointing. It just gave me a tingling feeling and nothing else. Stick to exercising and doing abdominal and core workouts if you want a toned tummy. ",0
"Like the brown for during the day-softer, less harsh for my blonde/blue eyed/med complexion. Gets every lash, good separation and good control. Only disappointment is it doesn't curl the top lashes like advertised--any uplift is very slight. ",2
"Like the description reads: sexy, seductive, and sensual. I love it. I usually like to get my perfume at other large department stores so that I can get free stuff (hey we are spending $75+ on perfume, I deserve a free duffle) but on a whim, I decided to get this for my winter perfume. Love it! Goes on heavy but eventually simmers down, but later in the day, you put on your sweater and can still smell the sexy thickness",1
"like the pizza boxes say, you've tried all the rest now try the best!!! Color goes on smoothly and last the ENTIRE day!! Just a little bit of shimmer makes it perfect for day and work wear. I will never go back to powder shadows after using this. No need for a primer here and absolutely no creasing!! ",2
"Like the shampoo, I love this product. Most conditioners weigh my fine hair down and this does not. It is very creamy but not heavy and and leaves the ends so smooth and hydrated, even after I blow dry it. These products will permanetly be in my shower from now on. ",0
Like the silky feel of the lipstick case & the smooth rich feel of the lipstick on my lips. The color is rich and fills in my lips to make them look plump. Don't care for the taste which is a bit perfume like.,3
"Liner that actually remains a line! smudgable before set, all day makeup. Heed the warning of the Sephora shop people, buy Make Up Forever remover before you leave the store. You'll just have to go back. ",2
"Lip gloss and princess perfume, in one? It had me instantly. I love this duo. The lip gloss is nice and light, and of course the Princess perfume rollerball is a nice for freshening up away from home. ",0
Lip strip feels so good on your lips. I have dry chapped lips much of the winter and I wanted something that treated them. This is actually fun to use - just rub it in and it mildly exfoliates your lips. I wipe most of it off but it has such a pleasant taste you don't mind what stays there. Using this and then the salve has made a big difference in the texture of my lips. ,4
"Liquid primers always feel like another layer I don't need. This powder primer is easy to apply, feels good and works well under a mineral foundation or by itself over sun screen. It is a simply good idea. ",4
"Lives up to its name. It provides moisture, but is not oily, for a youthful, natural look. I went from using tinted moisturizer to this option because I felt I needed more coverage but didn't want a made-up look. ",2
"Local Sephora did a test day, and I had this tested - had to buy it immediately It is the most incredible product - I actually sort of grossed myself out by the amount of gunk coming out of my pores - blackheads just poured [no pun intended!] right away, completely cleaned up my skin. I have sensitive skin, and hate extractions - this is my new dream product. and the blue/yellow blend is very cute when you mix it in your hand! ",2
"l'occitane had the shea butter long before all of the knock offs out there. they do it the best. this body cream is so rich and creamy and just leaves you feeling so soft and refreshed. this tub of cream will last you a long time and it is worth every penny. it smells so great. not like perfume, just fresh. i promise if you try this cream , you will never be without it. it is hands down the best body cream out there. ",2
Lolita smells delightful. I gave this as a gift to a lovely young lady and she loves it. In fact when her friends smelled her they came to me and told me how awesome Lolita smells and that they wanted a bottle. ,3
Long lasting lipgloss and a handy whiting side attacked. I use the pink shade and it's great. The Brite Smile is great for touch ups and perfect after a meal or snack to freshen your breath and make sure teeth are sparkling clean and white. A Keeper!! ,4
"Looking for a new blush, I tried the infamous ""Orgasm"" to find it was too pink for my skintone. The Sephora makeup artist recommended ""Torrid"". It suited me perfectly. This is the blush I use when I don't have time for full makeup or just want to apply a bit of colour and lipgloss. It also brings out my green eyes. Love it!",2
Looking for an exfoliator that will wash away dead dull skin yet also hydrate your skin without making it feel parched or oily? This is it!! It's such a great product for complexions that used to be oily but now is dry on the forehead and cheeks - possibly from anti-aging serums. Love this! I use it every other day and will probably just use it once a week now to maintain a healthy glow. ,2
"LORAC Oil-Free Luminizer is amazing for those who love to shimmer. Out of all the luminizers I've tried (Stila, NARS, and so on), this one stands out as the luminizer that packs the most glitter. L1 -- Pearl comes out translucent and very shimmery (but this can only be seen in the light). L2 -- Gold, on the other hand, comes out a brownish color (not translucent at all on those of fairer complexion). As someone who loves glittery products, I have chosen LORAC's luminizer over and over again. This is not to say, however, that this product is without its flaws. My main problem is that by itself, this luminizer is sticky, dries very quickly, and is hard to apply and spread on its own. Otherwise, when mixed with a foundation, it brings a beautiful perk. All in all, I would still choose LORAC as my #1 for luminizer. ",0
"Lorac's Oil Free Neutralizer is an overall great product. I have used it for years. Great with minimizing the red tones in my skin. I either mix with my foundation for a light coat or apply before my foundation for a heavier coat, either way works great. ",1
"Love all the products in this kit, especially the marble eyeshadow and the blush. Great colors, great consistency and long lasting. The only negative comment I can make is that the Balance N Brighten is the medium shade, way too dark for me as a floundation so I will use as a contour/bronzer. ",4
"Love Daisy by MJ. My favorite fragrance to date. No musky notes (hate musk), all fresh, fruit, jasmine, honeysuckle, (normally do not like florals).....hard to describe and my skin chemistry is odd so most perfumes do not smell good on me, but this one is absolutely intoxicating....simply can't get enough. Wish the staying power was longer, but the fragrance is so good, I had to give it five stars (not to mention the bottle is adorably quaint, girly, and fun).",2
"Loved all the products. Some reviewers did care for the mascara. Not the best overall mascara out there but it works very well and the glitter side is a fun touch. It is subtle and gives a nice flicker when the light hits it. Lip gloss is tops and the makeup colors are beautiful for most colorings and work well from day to evening. A versitle kit that is sure to be one of your favorites too. Also, as always the BE brushes are great. Love this kit! ",2
"Loved the concept of the product, but when I actually tried it on, it is the worst product that I have ever purchased! It went on heavy, and it is really hard to blend, especially if you do your nails. I also tried blending with a brush, but that didn't work out either because the color went everywhere. It also didn't fit my eyelid that well. I would not recommend this to anyone. ",0

"loved the idea AND LIKED THE FORMULA, BUT THE COLOR WAS TOO SHIMMERY for me and the delivery system left something to be desired, it was ttoo hard to get the brush in and out cleanly and with the right amount, wish it had a better container and less shiny version of this color ",2
"Loved the way this made my skin feel, but I did find it left my skin to oily, I cut it back to only using about 4 drops. Yes, a little on this one goes a long long way. Would be great for dryer skin or in cold winter weather at night. ",3
Love everything about it - very high quality - just paid $20 for a Chanel polish I fell in love with and Sephora has a shade very much like it for $9. Looking forward to trying a lot of the new shades. Love the OPI range of colors and the names are a hoot and a half! ,4
"Love Exhibit A..A perfect example of something looking kind of scary and clownishly bright in the compact. When I put it on my skin, it was a sheer beautiful uplifting burst of juicy color. It wakes up a pale face and makes it gorgeous all day and night. As others have said..a lttle dab with a soft fluffy brush is enough to last all day. It may be pricey, but it will last almost forever.",2
"Love it, brightens under eye, lays on skin nicely for over 40 skin. Does not alligator (over 40 you know what I mean) I've mixed it with moisturizer and applied using a brush to other areas of redness and works great! ",2
LOVE IT!!!! Covers beautifually. Would def. recomend this product. I have very sensitive skin & have not had a problem with breakouts due to this cover up. It goes on great very natural looking. Will continue using it. It's great!!!!,2
"LOVE it. Like other reviews have said: YES it is only the very very top of the powder that is at all shimmery. There is no sparkle whatsoever in the rest. It is soooooooo wonderful. Really evens out my skin tone, hides shine well and the smell is to die for! Definitley worth the splurge! ",1
"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!! Everytime I wear this, I get so many compliments, especially by men, it's lthe best, it's soft & sweet smelling i, my boyfriend can't get enough of it, and either can I !!!!!",0
Love Love Love the brush on this new mascara!! It is easy to use and enables you to reach the lashes in the inside corner of your eyes. Now about the actual product --- I constantly have to check the mirror to see if I have mascara under my eyes.. :-( Very sticky formula so it feels like it never dries on your eyes (which would be great if you want to look like a racoon!!) ,3
"LOVE LOVE LOVE the dispenser! This needs to be a permanent part of all of their products. No fuss, no mess, easy to carry. Wish all my BE products were so portable. Mineral veil leaves a nice finish on the face but I don't generally use it. I got this for the reusable dispenser. I'll put my normal ""Tan"" BE in it when it's empty. Bring more products like this! ",4
"Love, love, love these lipsticks. I am a fan of the entire Bare Escentuals product line so these new lip colors were long awaited. The colors are beautiful and the plumping really works. Very long lasting and I hope to see more color choices. ",4
LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Amazing Grace has been my signature fragrance for several years now... I use the perfumed oil now and reach for it every day. It has lasting power like no other. I can dab it behind my ears in the morning and have compliments on how I smell well through dinner. ,2
"Love, love, love this product. Could not start or end the day without using it. Leaves skin so soft and smooth; great base for moisturizer and makeup. At the end of the day, skin has a beautiful glow. I'm 60 and my mom is 85 - everyone always comments on our skin. And yes, my Mom turned me on to it. It is my favorite gift to give.",4
"Love, love ""the kiss of the dragon"" very oriental, with spices, chocolate and musk. Eu De Cartier is light and citrusy for summer which I really like. The concentrate is too spicy and masculine for me, too much juniper I'd say, but it smells great on my husband! The one in the red round bottle has got an odd fruity scent which I don't care for, but suits my friend, Piper, whom I gave it to - she loves it. ",4
"love, love this lip gloss. great applicator, wonderful silky formula, gorgeous colors with just the right amount of sparkle. I can leave the store with three colors instead of just one higher-priced brand. what's not to love? ",2
LOVE! LOVE! this product. Great product for thinning hair. It gives a lot of volume without weighing the hair down. Not sticky! I also use the entire phyto line for thinning hair & love every product. ,4
"Lovely is the perfect word to describe this very feminine fragrance. I only bought it because I love Sarah Jessica Parker, but I am very glad to say that it is my favorite perfume, and I have many! I get so many compliments on this, both from men and women. I will always love this scent, no matter how long I wear it! ",2
"Love Nars blushes. Any color a girl could want, great pigmentation, and lasts all day. I see why the color ""O"" (I can't write the actual word I guess??) has been on many ""best of"" lists, this one is really a knockout color that seems to work on many, many skintones. Nars blush line does what not all lines do, the colors you find can work with the lightest and darkest of skin colors. If you love their powder blush, Nars cream blush is well worth checking out as well!!",1
Love Nars lipsticks and liners. Colors are really beautiful. Rosebud liner is perfect for the Pigalle lipstick. Works with several of my other lipsticks as well. TOP quality. The price is high but worth it. ,3
"Love the blush, lipgloss and mascara! The colors are perfect for touchups during the day and the mascara is very natural. Only the powder was a disappointment - much to glittery for me. Maybe it will be ok for after 5p happy hours. ",2
"Love the color. It takes me back to when I was in high school in the 60s. The lipstick is soft and after it has been applied, it leans. Hence, you either straighten it or it is scraped by the side of the tube as you twist it down. Wasteful and messy! ",4
Love the depth and last of this color over the Buxom Lip gloss. But wish they had used the old wand to apply it instead of the lip brush. The lip brush is hard to work with. I still love this product and will order more colors. ,2
"Love their products. All of them have a wonderful glimmer to them that diffuse light and give you a subtle glow and their mascaras are excellent, too. The glosses give you soft, beautiful color without looking made up. This set is such a bargain--try it now!! ",2
Love the mineral sunscreen and the light reflecting quality. Possibly not for oily skin. I love this foundation. I have been a repeat user for years. It lasts a long time as well. Worth the $$. Colors are great. ,4
"Love the product, moistuizes well, smell is not overwhelming. Whether or not it firms, well we'll see. Only complaint is the text on the bottle. Don't need god in my body lotion, unless, of course miracles will happen ;) ",3
"Love these colors together! The little talking thing in the compact is very cute, although once you get the info you don't really need to hear it again. The palette is a great neutral eye look, and you can cat it up as much or as little as you want to. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that I like to take things like this in my travel bag, and without any included brushes I have to pack my own. Otherwise, as a pale blonde, these colors are totally perfect, a great look for day without being over the top. Also nice if you are going to do a bold lip color. ",2
"LOVE these colors when you first apply them. They have great texture, shine and pigment. however, they DO NOT last. That's the price you have to pay for moisturizing, sheer color. You will have to reapply every hour. ",1
LOVE these lipsticks and i have tried MANY. I have #209 and 213 they are beautiful neutral pinks without too much brown (for reference I am fair skinned brunette) They feel good on your lips and last several hours without feeling dry. My only complaint is that they never seem to have enough of these in stock at my Sephora. Will repurchase for sure though and I seldom repurchase a lipstick brand and i am a junkie. ,3
"Love these little things -- they're as sheer and naturally dewy-looking as liquid blushes, but the gel sticks are a little slower-drying, which makes them easier to apply and blend without uneven streaky spots. The colors are very sheer and natural-looking, even on my fair skin, but it's also buildable so you can get a deeper wash of color for deeper skin tones. And the various scents are pleasantly subtle. My only complaint is that the stick can tend to ""sweat"" a little bit in storage, especially if you don't use the product every day. It's still perfectly usable, but can be a little messy if you aren't expecting drops of blush-colored liquid when you remove the cap! ",2
"Love these things! I use the lower lash strip exclusively. When you use the lower lash on your tops eyelids, they are the perfect length-need no trimming-and look more natural than regular upper lid lash strips. Perfect-DON'T change them OR stop making the lower lashes! ",4
"Love the smell. Love it as a body wash but felt it did not lather up to my expections in my hair. I have very thick hair and am that kind of person who feels it is only clean with alot of lather, hence 4 stars. WIll keep using it though.",1
"Love this baby balm lipstick - I bought one and then got another two because I was so happy with it. I also love the Vincent Longo lipstain - they really know what is important in a lipstick. Great, natural looking color that wears well and keeps lips hydrated. It isn't long lasting, but I much prefer it over my former cakey, dry looking lipsticks of yesteryear. These are modern and fresh and all the colors I have are lovely and enhance without looking made up. ",3
"Love this blush! The colors go on nice and sheer, so you can really control how much color is going on your face. Some of the shimmery ones have a bit too much glitter for my taste, but some are just the right amount of sheen.",0
"Love this collection! The cheek colors are perfect and stay on all day. You won't find eye shadows as pretty as these and look how many you get. The lip glosses could have a little more pigment but I still love them because the are not sticky. Lorac is the first brand that I have tried that has smooth, creamy, non sticky lip gloss. Buy it, you won't find this much and this great a product for less anywhere! ",4
"Love this for a quick pick-me-up of color. Gives you a nice glow, but just like all Bare Escentual products, use a light hand and you will get a very nice all-over face color. Use your mineral veil over it and you're done!",4
Love this foundation. Received a sample with another order and after I tried it I ordered it right away. Go on very smooth and moisturizing (I use a slightly damp sponge). Lines look better and my face looks so natural like I don't have any foundation on. ,3
"Love this! I have oily eyelids and eyeliner always wanders by the end of the day - or night! I use Too Faced mascara and wondered if there was an eyeliner like it and sure enough- here it is. Absolutely indelible, stays through thick and thin. Easily removed with cleanser and gentle pressure. A winner!",4
"Love this. It holds the shine at bay for up to an 8 hoour (horrid) work day. And, it doesn't dry out my skin or leave ugly white residue. This is the only oil control product that has ever worked for me. ",4
Love this--it is so different from any of my other perfumes (I am a junkie). Everyone always says how good I smell when I wear this. It is a great fragrance and it has real lasting power. Very warm and fun.,2
"Love this lipstick. Love the packaging, love everything. I bought Ms. Behavin' after searching for a darker shade of lipstick that wouldn't make my pale complexion look too pale. This is sheer enough that it works for me, and the color is build-able. So smooth. ",1
"Love this multipurpose quad to bits -- you can use these shadows on their own for a sheer, subtle wash of iridescent color, or layer it over matte shadows for highlighting or totally transforming the original shade with an iridescent glow. ",2
"LOVE this primer! Granted, it is the only primer I have ever used. But it's amazing. It makes my face look and feel flawless. I use the Light one as I have very oily skin, and it does help oil control for a few hours, but not long-term. I still needed to blot and/or add powder. But it is not meant for oil control, and it does its job perfectly!",0
"LOVE this product and the price is right too. Couldn't locate it at the store this last time so ordered it on line and got 2 of them. Like the way they apply easily and if I ""goof"" a flick of a Qtip takes it right off. Sometimes I just use the lenght end - sometimes just the volume and sometimes BOTJ. Great versatility! Go fot this one..... ",4
Love this product! I can use it to conceal and it works wonderfully to help get rid of acne. I have oily/combo skin and this really works to help get rid of the occasional blemish. Will def buy again! ,0
"Love this product. I have it in green, blue and brown. Stays on forever. Will only come off with makeup remover or soap and water after 24 hours. It does not smudge or smear under my eyes. Our climate is very hot and humid and this is the only mascra that works. I have tried the most expensive to least expensive mascra on the market and this is the best producet EVER ",3
"Love this product, it last forever it takes such a small amount. Packaged well, everything you need in one nice kit. Brow color stays well, the wax is perfect to work with, soft, not sticky, doesn't harden up & flake off like some clear gels, the brush is one of the best & the stencils are a plus.... after you practice with them, you will love them. ",3
Love this product. Not only do I love the color but it does leave my skin with a dewy finish. Just what I was looking for. It gives me just the right amount of coverage that I like. Its not too sheer nor is it too thick. ,2
"Love this scent - this is the one that first got me hooked on the LMDLV line. Despite the name and the listed notes, on my skin it's really not particularly floral; it's mostly just a rich, warm vanilla-amber blend with a hint of incensey depth, soft and sweet without being cloyingly sugary. It's a great comfort scent for vanilla lovers, light enough for daytime/summer/office wear but still strong enough to linger pleasantly on your skin throughout the day. If you like sweet vanillas but find a lot of the current crop of gourmand vanilla scents are just a little too sticky-sweet and girlish for your tastes, give this a try -- especially at these bargain clearance prices, you'd pay a lot more than this for most drugstore scents that aren't nearly as nice!

"Love this set. Like others I am not crazy about the Pure Vanilla, but absolutely LOVE the Vanilla Grapefruit. The fragrance lasts all day and is so refreshing. I am definitely buying the full size next time. Vanilla Coconut makes me hungry! I like it too! ",3
"love this stuff because it doesnt look overly done when its on the color is just right theres suble flecks of glitter in it that hilite your cheeks. goes on light and sheer, very fine power so its easy to control the intensity",1
"Love this stuff for active summer days -- when humidity, perspiration, swimming or other activities make regular foundation a poor choice, this gives long-lasting, convenient all-in-one sun protection while evening out skintone beautifully. It looks sheerer and feels lighter on than you might expect from what looks like a pancake-stick foundation, and is remarkably long-wearing even on the oily zones of my combination skin. Love, love, love this stuff, if Shiseido ever discontinues it I'll have to stockpile these by the case! ",2
Love this stuff. If you want something just for fun this is the stuff. Oh and it works too. All of the lip balms smell and taste just like their names and the packaging is really cool. Nice part is the lip balm do not change your natural lip color ,3
"Love this trimmer. No razor bumps in sensitive areas! Amazing. Haven't tried the epilator yet, working up my nerve. Wouldn't even care if they didn't include it in the kit, all other attachments work so well! ",1
"Made my brown spots fade after one use and they keep getting better. Light moisture, clean, light fragrance. Works great under makeup. You may need to use a light moisturizer on top of it if your skin is dry or flaky. ",2
"Make me look like a bronze goddess please. Just get this palette and you're half way there. LOVE the green color in the bottom right corner, but all the colors are rich and creamy. LOVE these compacts - pick one or two to travel with and you're set with many different looks. ",1
"makes my face smooth and keeps it oil-free all day. i put it on before make-up, let it dry for a couple of minutes and make-up application is so much easier!!\n\nhowever, they should modify their pump system because i tend not to get every last bit because the pump doesn't pick up miniscule amounts. i would suggest getting the travel-sized one so that you can squeeze every last bit out of this thing (you would want to for the price!)",0
"Makes my pale cheeks look flushed and adorable. My boyfriend commented on how he loves how I'm always blushing. I just smiled to myself, and silently thank stila and tarte for they're amazing cheek stains. ",0
Makes my skin look and feel great. Very lightweight; a perfect finish to my face. What I really like about this product is that it absorbs excess oil and shine but doesn't cake or look fake like some other powders. ,0
Make sure not to use too much (as another reviewer stated). This has definitely made a difference in the fullness and manageability of my hair. I'm extremely happy with the results of this product (and the line of products in general). ,4
"Makes your nails/eyelashes glow bright white This kit is a lot of fun for clubbing, but I suggest being very careful with application. Try to get near a fluorescent black light because the stuff is clear and you'll never see it it you get it all over your eye, and it doesn't come off easily, but its worth it for the price ;-) ",0
"Make Up Forever has a reputation for serious cosmetics; i.e. their products are close to theatrical make-up. DO NOT LET THIS FRIGHTEN YOU! all it means is that their powders and shadows are concentrated, with a generous amount of pigment; their pencils are long-wearing; in short, your make up will last longer and wear truer when you use this brand. I have quite significant sun damage from my youth, which I am treating with Retin-A. I also have sensitive, oily with a dry surface skin; makeup tends to cake on my face. I have tried concealers from almost every line you can think of, and MUF's is the only one opaque enough to cover even the darkest imperfections. it is not as oily as other concealers, which results in a longer wear time. the colors do not darken on the skin either. I highly recommend this product. I use an imitation bristle brush- Sephora's Brush 25. the wide brush head spreads the thinnest amount of product for buildable coverage. a great concealer. ",2
"Make up forever is a winner. Their eyeshadow pigments (as well as their blush), are extraordinary! They are the strongest brand on the market! (including MAC) They last all night and come in such a wide variety of colors. The electric yellow is super fun to mess around with! They are also even MORE pigmented (hard to imagine!), when you use one of Make up Forever's pencils underneath. Definitely worth your dollar :) ",0
Makeup is the art of re-directing the viewer's eye to the part of your face that you want to emphasize. This involves toning down the lines and creases and toning up the eyes and uplifting the face. The Natural Light Face Lifting Duo does this by providing a means to draw attention away from creases and lines by placing light reflecting powder in those areas and drawing light towards the outer and inner corners of the eye. The lighter powder goes into the lines. The more neutral powder goes above the eyebrow (drawing the viewer's eye upward on your face) and along the top of the cheekbone. The combination of the two put POWer in your look. I use the precision concealer brush to do this. ,4
"Man, this primer is the best thing ever in terms of putting on eyeshadow and keeping it on. Being that i have oily skin, sometimes the eyeshadow just ""melts"" away. But if i put a SLIGHT coat of this on, the eyeshadow stays ALL DAY and it looks like it does in the package on my skin. Same vibrancy, color, fabulousness. LOVE IT. ",0
"many thanks to benefit for creating a MATTE bronzer for the face! no more going out looking like an oscar statuette! i also like that this product tints your face - you can apply SPF over the product after it soaks in. one request? how about a ""talk to the tan"" with SPF 30? THEN we would have the perfect product!!! ",2
"mascara and lipstick is the only makeup i wear. This lip attitude chic is the best i have ever put on. i like that it is no shimmer. goes on smooth and my lips don't feel dry. hubby likes it too, he keeps kissing me and the color stays put. will buy more colors. ",4
"Melon Daiquiri is my very FAVORITE of the Philosophy shampoo/bubble bath line. It is fruity, without being cloyingly sweet, and a silky, lush shower gel. If used for shampoo, you will need to add a separate conditioner, but it is WELL WORTH IT!!!!!",4
"MEOW this blush will love your face unconditionally. Its a great formula, and NARS has managed to make every single color of this blush - all of which look good on people of all colors! WORD OF WARNING - you will fall in love instantly, and want to swim in this stuff, but apply carefully - very very little goes a very very long way!",0
"Meringue Jalouse 2 is the perfect rose. just the tiniest touch gives my fair skin a lovely, natural flush. these blushes are pigment-packed and have a soft, finely milled texture. and again, a great buy! thanks again, Sephora! ",2
"Mineral Veil is the perfect topping on the most beautiful, flawless unmadeup face- so light, luminous and natural. Sets your enhancement (not makeup) for the day and is wonderful just by itself. Wouldn't be caught naked faced without it!!!",4
"Missed out on this one. Wanted a lipstick sealer. This product is not designed to do that, however, good for what its supposed to do, Brush super saturated as it sits in the liquid, needs to be blotted first, for me anyway. ",4
"""Mmm..someone smells really sweet, like sugar cookies"" was the first comment I heard when wearing this perfume. I love this scent because it makes me feel ""pretty."" I ALWAYS get compliments on how good I smell when I'm wearing this.",0
"Moisturizer is the 1 thing I'll break the bank on. And have. Until now. I get asked on a regular basis ""what do you use?"" I highly recommend the Rx products to ANY woman wanting a better looking and/or flawless complexion ",2
"Moisturizing; light-weight; easy to apply. This foundation glides on for sheer to medium coverage that looks and feels very natural; like you are not wearing makeup at all. It ""sets"" and stays fresh looking all day long. Love it! ",2
"more good stuff from Sephora. lots of pigment, blend well together or with their excellent sparkly shadows, good color range, and a great price. matte shadows can easily be gritty in formula: these are soft and smooth in texture. thank you, Sephora. ",2
"More than anything else this gloss is a converstaion starter. I like how youcan see it working when you put it on, even if you apply it with your finger first. It's a great gloos for people not comfortable with color on their lips It's always the right color for you. It looks really cool over other lip colors too. ",1
"Most aluminum-free antiperspirant/deodorant alternatives just don't work, even on cold winter days. But this stuff actually does prevent odor and doesn't smell ridiculous. Perfect for a man who doesn't want to smell like sweat or flowers. Doesn't irritate my skin either.",2
"Most lip glosses are STICKY -- and I hate that! This gloss not only isn't sticky ... it is a great combination of shine and feel-good ingredients! I love the color of #4... and #1 (clear) is great, too! ",2
"Most lipstick leaves my lips feeling chapped, but this formula was truly different. I tried the Napoli shade, which was very subtle, because I am not much of a lipstick wearer. This is a very neutral shade. The packaging is also awesome! Very chic. This lipstick feels almost as good on my lips as lip balm. I will definitely buy again.",3
"Much to thick for a day cream and with a bizarre scent (rye with other notes). Maybe I didn't appreciate it because I don't have mature skin, but I got it in a kit with some other items and had to try it anyway... I use it as a night cream when my regular night cream has run out. My money is on their rose line, this one is just too much for little results. I've used 'antiaging' products before, and I wouldn't have ever pegged this as one in a 'blind' test. ",1
MUFE Aqua Eyes are my Holy Grail eyeliners. I have oily eyelids and previously had a hard time with staying power of eyeliners. Aqua Eyes stays on my lids and lower lashline all day without smearing or smudging! ,2
"MUST HAVE Brush! This is a basic for the make up kit. Blends beautifully, great for applying color in the crease and buffs out shadow so there are no lines of demarcation. High quality... no shedding, no flaking and easy to wash and dry. A MUST! ",4
my 16 year old son has the normal adolescent breakouts. using murad clarifying cleanser keeps them to a bare minimum making him more comfortable with his complexion.\nwe have tried many other products and nothing has ever worked as well as this product. highly recommend.,3
"My 1st NARS blush. I love, love, love it. It looks so natural with just very little applied. I have to buy another before it is gone. I will definitely buy more NARS blush. The best blush I have ever used and it glides on so smooth. NARS blush makes the face glow. ",2
My 22 yeard old son loved this & so did my hubby who is 45.I couldn't decide between the two so I gave it to my brother in law(46).My sister was thrilled when she smelled it.Sephora made us 2 samples of this which is why I knew how AWESOME IT SMELLS. Thank you Sephora...... Kat ,2
"My aesthetician recommended that I buy the Clarisonic, but I couldn't justify plunking down that kind of money for a face brush. I decided to try this instead and I am happy to say that it works quite beautifully! My skin just looks cleaner!",0
"My bathroom is beginning to look like a Korres store. Since switching over to natural/organic/green products, Korres is pretty much my favorite brand. I have extremely oily skin, so few wrinkles, but showing other signs of age (skin is 55 years old, but I feel younger than that), like splotching and dullness, especially when I've got the flu bug. I love this stuff ... I immediately feel glow-y after using it. Love to lay in the tub with a layer on my face. I look gorgeous for bed time. It even glows through my morning face. ",4
"My beauty routine has always included something to hide blemishes. I used to use a cream concealer that felt greasy and heavy on my skin. One day I was watc hing an infomercial for BareMinerals Multi-Tasking Face Concealer and decided to give it a try. What a difference! BareMinerals Multi-Tasking Face Concealer is lightweight, blends with my natural skin color, and stays in place all day. People comment on my flawless skin; and I just smile and say thank you. Thanks BareMinerals Multi-Tasking Face Concealer.",4
"My best friend gave this to me as one of my Christmas presents, and it's absolutely amazing! I live in eye makeup, and this makes it so easy to take off! It's conveniently packed in a tin, kind of like salve tins, so you can take it anywhere. The make-up remover has a consistency of petroleum jelly/ vasaline but not to worry! After leaving it on your lashes and eyelids for 30 seconds, a simple tissue wipe will take away literally everything and leave your skin nice and smooth. Also, this doesn't make your vision blurry after you take off your makeup, it just leaves a soothing moisturized feeling. Definitely a must have for all make up kits. Try it out for yourself, you won't regret it! ",0
"My biggest concern when ordering lip gloss without trying it first, is the question of moisture. These glosses are not only beautiful but they have improved my dry lips!! PLUS - with so many color choices, I have a color for every outfit! ",1
"My biggest problem with this blush is how sticky it is - making it quite hard to blend. Also - while the blush looks very hard as a gel, I barely notice the color on my cheeks - definitely not worth all the money. ",0
"My boyfriend has been wearing this fragrance for a couple of years and I have to say it is my favorite cologne of all time. It doesn't smell like every other men's fragrance out there. It is crisp, clean, and very appealing.",1
"My Boyfriend likes to be completely natural. That would be fine if he didn't have some strong body odor. Unfortunately, he likes his 'natural odor'. I Don't. For his birthday I bought him Anthony Logistics Alcohol Free Deodorant, and he was rather disappointed in this gift. First he said I should send it back. I begged him to try it. He says the main reason he doesn't wear deodorants is because they give him a rash. After I had convinced him this one was different, he did try it. Wala! He LOVES IT! He likes the way it smells, and it doesn't irritate his skin. I love it too. It smells so fresh and clean, not strong smelling at all. Now we.re both happy.",4
"My boyfriend presented me with a wonderful selection of fragrance samples for my birthday and allowed me to pick my favorite and receive a whole bottle. This was my choice. I've never been a big fan of florals, but I love the fresh and light scent of this fragrance. I find it appropriate for all occasions - a casual day at work or a night on the town.\n\nMy one complaint (echoing another's comment) is that it doesn't last as long as I would like. I keep refilling the small sample bottle so I can get ""refreshers"" throughout the day.A longer lasting scent would have earned it that fifth star.",1
"My boyfriend surprised me with this for my birthday, and my first thought was how cute the color is, I have never seen an all while straightener. The first time I used it, WOW I have never used a more wonderful tool to straighten my hair than this! I like straighteners to have a temperature setting because I'm afraid of it getting too hot, but I haven't had a problem with the ghd. This is worth every cent like others have said, a really fantastic product, and you can't go wrong with the warranty either. ",0
"My brows are wider at center and narrow at edges. This product lasts all day, doesn't smudge, makes my brows look groomed. I use a pencil in black to fill in at the outer edges. It is a filler, so don't draw them on with it. ",2
"My computer is faulty I can't change the darn nickname or star rating .okay this is the best ever.my hair is not colored so its not really damaged at all, I had like 3 chi's in the past two years they suk ...break down.my hair is not thick just unruly and. This is great all you have to do is leave ur hair a tad bit damp and let it steam ..its fantastic. ",0
"My daily bath or shower is my second favorite time of day, to wash off the miseries and stresses and get ready for my really favorite time of day, bedtime! I have a bath and shower full of natural bath products. My favorite is Korres guava bath. This is a nice change of pace. I'd prefer more of a scentual punch and more sudsing. ",4
"My daughter and I were told by a Sephora salesperson that this was the best product for keeping lipstick on longer--can even use it on your lids befor applying eyeshadow.. It is terrible!!. When applied to your lips with a thin coat, it changes the color of your lipstick all together. Reds become pinks, etc. Save your $23 for something else. ",3
"My daughter bought this for me last Mother's Day and I am on my second tube! I have never been able to use a moisturizer before because my skin is just too oily. This hydrates with no irritating scent and keeps me matte all day! I use it under my Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer and my blothchy, oily 48 year old skin looksa great! ",3
"My daughter has really sensitive gums and we were having trouble finding a whitening product that didn't irritate them. Go White is perfect. She can apply the solution to each tooth and very little gets on the gums. The results were marked and it's so easy. I use Go White to keep my mocha-lovin' teeth at their brightest, too. ",3
My daughter is a NYC make-up artist. She suggested posie tint. I've tried to find a good stain that isn't red. I can control the amount of color I want (pink). I kept it on for 6 hours straight last night with minimal eating. Just reapplied gloss. A product that does what it says. What a treat.,4
"My daughter loves Kat Von D & was excited when she came out with a make up line & when we went to the store, I bought one of these for her in another color which she fell in love with & when I had a chance to get her another one she was so happy. She wears it so often.... Of course now she wants more of her products, will have to work on that one step at a time. ",3
"My daughters (who do not live at home) but shop in mom's make up bag kept taking my full size Lip Venom so I bought this mini venom set gave each one and put one in my purse. For now my full size is safe but as soon as they run out I'm sure it will be ""kidnapped"" again! ",3
"My daughter would often come over to my house to use my Tweezerman tweezers because they work so well. I got her this set as a surprise gift. Her entire face just lit up. The tweezers do an excellant job and this set has the added bonus of just being very pretty. It also comes in its own little case. My daughter now has her very own set and quite frankly, I am a little jealous. My regular ones just aren't as nice. It really makes for a great gift. Think of a stocking stuffer for any age female! ",3
My dermatologist got me to use Kinerase and I discovered the daily cleanser when I realized that I needed something that would take off any and all makeup but not leave my skin tight and dry. Some people like tight and dry but for me I knew that meant I'd have to use even more moisturizer and never feel like my skin was absorbing what it needed. This cleanser feels good and I can layer on the rest of what I need with each layer integrating and being absorbed. Perfect. ,4
My dermatologist loves this line so I ordered it from Sephora. I was disappointed. Despite using it twice a day I didn't see nearly as much change as expected. I switched to a different product now and I am much happier with the results. ,4
"My dry, curly hair cannot use this alone as a styling product. It's good at dealing with frizz but has no hold for my curls. I like to complement it with the Phyto 9 creme or some other moisturizing creme with a little hold. The price is high, but a little product goes a long way. ",1
"My dry, curly hair loves this product. Unfortunately, it loves a lot of this product. So for the size and the price, I am not sure how I will be able to justify purchasing this product again. Works better on my hair by complementing it with Phytodefrisant. ",1
"My expectations were very high when I purchased this kit because I had heard a lot of positive things about the products in it. I was so dissapointed when I used it! I have normal/oily skin with a few dry spots and the mineral foundation made the dry areas look ""cakey"". I also felt like the primer did absolutely nothing for my skin. The brushes in the kit are nice and the Warmth and Mineral Veil were ok but I would never purchase any of it again.......I think I will just stick to tinted moisturizer! ",1
"My eyebrows are very light, & tend disappea, As I have big blue eyes, looks unfinished w/o eyebrows. Never found a product that matched--most blondes looked reddish on my skin, browns too dark--Gypsy clown!!! Still learning, just got Anastasia spooley brush so will carry on.",3
"My eyes are hazelish mostly a darker green color and this shadow really make them pop! I was hesitant about the green with my green eyes, but it so beautiful. It's not a flat color, it has a nice sheen to it and is slightly mixed with some other colors so that it doesn't read as a solid color. It's just beautiful and I've received so many compliments even from strangers about my beautiful eyes. Definitely a keeper - try it, you'll be amazed!! ",4
My eyes are really sensitive especially with the weather up here. This remover cleans makeup really well (and not just Dior makeup. This stuff has removed eyeshadows and eyeliners that clinique's just couldn't touch) and doesn't leave an oily residue. After using this I didn't feel like I needed to wash my eyes with soap and water. I am so glad I tried this. I don't know how I went without it. ,0
"My eyes are sensitive to liquid makeup remover. It is very difficult to find a gel one, such as Urban Decay clean & sober oil free make up remover. I have purchased this product over and over, as it has the desired results. ",2
"My eyes water a lot, and I tried a dozen or more ""waterproof"" mascaras before finding this one. Lancome Hypnose Waterproof mascara is the only mascara I've found that truly stays on! The Lancome counter at the mall department stores rarely has this, but I can always count on Sephora to have it! Highly recommend!!!!",2
"My face feels so much cleaner using Purity. I had been using another product where I also had to use a toner afterwards and it still didn't feel clean. Now with Purity, all I have to do is wash it and forget it. Great product. ",4
"My favorite color by far is ""S exual Healing"" . It's just the perfect anywhere, anytime color. NARS lipstick is smooth, and velvety. The colors are rich and beautiful. They're a bit off in the display pictures, though. Luckily Sephora has a great return policy.",1
"My favorite fragrance! I've gotten many comments on it! It is so subtle, I like to use the body wash and the perfume to make the scent more noticeable! Falling in Love makes a great gift for a wedding shower, everyone loves the story that is on the shower gel bottle and the box of the perfume! ",0
"my favorite hair product is fekkai glossing cream, there isn""t any product that can compare to it. It is so versatile on the days you don""t wash your hair it makes it look so shiny and clean , if you colr or bleach it puts back all the natural oils. I love it and use it every day. thanks Frederic ",4
"My favorite latest scent! It's light, fresh, & a little goes a long way. I haven't noticed any issues with the scent fading quickly; I can smell it on my jackets and scarves days later. Cute packaging to boot. ",0
My favorite thing about this gloss is the sugar scent. Other than that it is comparable to many lip glosses out there. Colors are somewhat long lasting and it is not sticky. I don't feel it is plumping though. ,1
My favourite eyeshadow blending brush. This brush is super soft and picks up the right amount of shadow. It also blends and softens any harsh eyeshadow application. Can also be used to highlight or contour your nose (with Stila Contouring kit). ,1
"My fiance smelled this in a house he was working in and asked his client what it was just so he could buy it for me and it became my favourite scent. It's so light and fresh, yet powerful enough to grab your attention and keep it. It's delicious.",0
"My first thought after putting this on was mmm. It smells good in a youthful cotton candy sweet kind of way. If you don't like sweet, it's not for you. I would say it is pleasant and not overbearing, but some might think it does smell sickeningly sweet. This scent is not something I could wear everyday.",0
"My friends touted BADgal Lash as the end-all, be-all of mascaras, but I remain unimpressed. I've bought it a couple of times, but am often frustrated by how bad my eyelashes look after careful application. I don't have great lashes, and this doesn't do too much to help them out, but it's better than some others I've tried.",0
"My friend tried this at Sephora a few weeks ago and bought it and I liked the color (pewter) so I bought it a few weeks later when I was getting some other things. It has a really nice color to it however I don't find it as creamy and as easily blendable as some other eyeshadows (i.e. Tarte, my absolute favorite). I would probably purchase again but it would depend on the shade. ",0
"My girlfriend gave me this as a gift last Christmas and I loved it. I had a great time trying all the different perfumes and I finally narrowed it down to two that I really liked. I turned in the certificate for my full sized bottle and ended up buying a bottle of the other perfume that I liked. This year, I am giving my friend this gift so she can play and experiment and find a perfume that she really likes. I hope she loves it as much as I did. The refillable purse spray is a nice touch, too. ",3
"My goat hairs are white, not as pictured but no matter, I am glad I got it. It's well priced and a good quality, I've purchased cheaper ones but that's what you get. Finally decided to treat myself to the type of brush for face powders I'd always wanted to own. Put it off for along time and read reviews of other brushes, some of which you could spend more but then people were complaining that the hairs were falling out so why do that. This brush is a nice quality and priced well. You can look at ""name brands"" but just like Kenmore, someone else is actually making it for them too. Liked it so much, I purchased more Sephora Professional brushes. ",4
My grandma introduced me to this stuff about 4-5 years ago and i have been addicted to it ever since. I have so many great things to say about this stuff. It only takes a dab so the big tin lasts forever! Try this stuff it moisturizes so well lasts forever and if you are washing your hands all day like I am you don't have to wory about reapplying it all of the time. WORTH EVERY PENNY AND THEN SOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
My Great Grandmother's name was Daisy so it was what led me to this fragrance. The add said it was fresh and feminine - which is true - and it definitely brings to mind the romance of a past era. It made me smile!!!,4
My hair gets very dry in the colder months so I will be stocking up on this soon. It has a light scent and really does it's job. It hydrates and protects my hair. It has great shine and put an end to that winter breakage. A MUST HAVE... ,1
"my hair has always been curly and frizzes at the first sign of water!!! Plus when I blow dry it, it looks like I was outside on a humid day! So wanted to try this product. It seems to work, still the frizzing after drying though, but I dont seem to have alot of body. Maybe there isnt a product out there that can do it all - but am still making a determination on whether I think this product works well enough to buy it again ",4
"My hair has a mind of its own and is coarse and always has been dry. Due to coloring it, it gets more dry with the different seasons.....BUT, this product works at once and makes it feel normal....to me. You do not need much, but it makes a world of difference. ",4
My hair has been somewhat abused. It has been colored and curled and can be very dry. This mousse is guaranteed not to dry your hair. It leaves the hair soft and because there isn't alcohol in it your hair keeps the shine. Wouldn't use any other mousse once I found this brand. ,4
"My hair has been through a bad time in recent months with unexpected surgey and other health issues so the stess has shown up in my hair - making it fragile and heartbreakingly thin. I have been searching for a heavy duty repair type treatment that I could leave on for a half hour or more. I have only used this treatment mask one time so far and noticed a difference in my hair immediately. It was silkier, softer and all of the broken, split pieces seemed to lay down better and not stick up all over creation! I am hoping with regular use of this treatment mask that my hair will look better than it has as of late! ",3
"My hair is baby fine. I thought that this product was going to be super volumizing. It's not. I get that it is a treatment, but I don't think that a fine hair is going to get density from this. In fact, I should have read the description a little better before I bought it. It is a great heavy-duty hydrator without the weight of a heavy-duty hydrator. Simply put, it does not weigh fine hair down but you get the moisture. So much conditioning that I've noticed less split ends and breakage from it (this is after almost 2 months of using it). I feel that you have to be dedicated to this product in order to see results. Maybe I'll review again in 6 months to update you guys. ",0
"my hair is fine but think. i applied a small amount to the bottom 3 inches of clean, damp hair and then blew dry. it was WAY to heavy and oily. by the middle of the day i looked like i hadnt washed my hair in 2 days. ",1
"My hair is naturally ash/beige blonde, & it's very fine, so washing, drying, curling can take a toll...Just shake this into the roots, massage in with your fingers, then brush out, followed by toweling at the part, roots. It smells great, gives volume & holding power to fine hair, & allows me to skip a day, so my hair stays healthier overall. I wonder how I got along without it! And it lasts, too---one larger size bottle has lasted me 10 months; I used it whenever I wanted. ",3
"My hair stylist recommended this product to another client of his, for damaged hair. I went out and brought it 3 years ago and have using it ever since. I tell everyone I hear commenting on their hair and the need to improve it. It have never failed me. The nail growing I never notice it, but my hair, the overall condition of my hair always improves. During season changing my hair go through this breaking shedding and drying stage ever season without fail. Phyto always makes my hair bounce back. I am an African American female with her own long hair. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT WORKS IF YOU USE IT AS RECOMMENDED. ",2
My hairstylist suggested I try this oil because I do not like the heavy feeling oils give my hair. I love this hair oil! It prevents my scalp from being dry which prevents dandruff. I LOVE the fragrance! I always used Dudley Products so this oil....has made me say bye-bye to Dudley Products. ,3
My hubby went into Sephora (!) to get this for his daughter for her birthday after I showed it to him online and he got one for me too! I love it! I'm surely going to be able to pick a divine fragrance from all these! ,3
"My husband always knows we are about to go out on the town whenever he smells this perfume on me. I absolutely love the smell... it makes me happy, makes me feel good, sexy and most of all, YUMMY! The description says it has a scent of vanilla and caramel, but this stuff reminds me of cotton candy, so if you don't like smelling super edible, this isn't the perfume for you. :-)",1
"My husband has a problem with dry skin, especially in the winter. He has a full beard, and uses this product to rub on the skin under his beard to keep the skin from flaking and moisturized, then shaves his cheeks. It is one product that he tells me to buy again, and he is hard to shop for!!",4
"MY HUSBAND HAS VERY DEEP PORES ( ""CRATERS""!!)ON HIS NOSE. ONE MORNING WE WERE GETTING READY TO GO TO A BUSINESS MEETING AND HE WAS PANICKING ABOUT HIS RED, ""CRATERED"" NOSE. H E WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO COVER UP THE REDNESS AND DEEP PORES WITH A STICK CONCEALER AND MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A CLOWN NOSE.\nI CONVINCED HIM THAT I HAD A MAGIC FIX-IT LOTION, WHICH HE DIDN'T BELIEVE, AND I SMOOTHED PHOTO FINISH FOUNDATION PRIMER ON HS NOSE, AND LO AND BEHOLD, THE ""CRATERS"" DISAPPEARED. i FINISHED THE JOB WITH SOME BARE MINERALS POWDER THAT ACTUALLY MATCHED HIS SKIN TONE, UNLIKE THE CONCEALER STICK, AND HE WAS AMAZED AT HOW GOOD HE LOOKED. HE WILL NEVER DISBELIEVE ME AGAIN!",4
My husband picked this one out for me and I absolutely love it! I have been asked many times by strangers what I am wearing and it stays on forever...no need for touch-ups during the day...or night!!! This one definitely has personality!,0
My husband used to use after shave balm that matched his cologne but it got too expensive to continue using. He really likes this product. It keeps his face smooth and has prevented razor burn. It's quite reasonably priced too.,1
"My husband went w/me to Sephora one day and he picked these up, amongst a few other men's products. Anyhow, I stole one from him, OMG, these work fabulous, my skin feels very clean, you can cleanse your neck area very well with these too. I feel like I've been to the spa. My skin looks great! Great tool and the price is right! I went back for more, can't be with out. ",3
"My inner gothic girl from my high school and college days wanted this lipgloss very badly, so I went for it without being really sure what to expect. Well, I got it today and tried it on and from the moment I looked myself in the mirror I thought, ""This can either be a disaster or my new favorite lip item."" The gloss is literally jet black and when first applied looks scary, but after some fancy (and/or persistent) work with the applicator wand you end up with shiny lips darkened to a rich plum shade, which can be lighter or darker depending on how much product you use. I find that lining the lips with the gloss first and then filling in the color produces the best results. It can be tough to get the saturation of the color to even out, so I had to press my lips together a lot to achieve the right consistency of color. I'm not such a fan of the wand itself, it doesn't really help to minimize the uneven application. Perhaps a sponge tip would've been better instead of the brush tip. This is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. I've been afraid of using too dark lipstick because it can make me look like a zombie, but this doesn't. I can see myself using this to create dramatic lip looks to go with a nude look without blush or eyeshadow. It makes lips pop big time so too much else on the face competes for attention. Seems that the best thing with this gloss is to play with it for awhile and find the best look to go with your skin tone. Anyway, I'm glad I got it and look forward to delving back into dark lip colors, especially for the winter season. ",0
"My lashes look so much fuller and longer since I starting using the Two-Timer Mascara. I love the double-ended wand. It's two bottles of masacara in one. I loved it so much the first time I used it that I ordered it again and will continue to re-order. Thank you for giving me ""blinkalicious lashes."" ",3
My lips do look a little bit plumper when I first put this on but it doesn't seem to last very long. I like the gloss though and it's great for protecting your lips from getting chapped in cold windy weather. The vials are small but they last a while since a little bit of this goes a long way. It's definitely a good idea to keep the vials together in the box...they get lost easily! ,3
"My lips get really horribly chapped very easily. And it's not just that my lips get chapped, the skin around the edges gets super dry and starts flaking off too. It's rather gross. And this inevitably happens every time I fly, which has been fairly often this summer. One of my friends got me this as a late bday present (my bday was in April, haha) and it works wonders. It's runny as far as lip treatments go, but it sinks in really well and it got rid of the worst of the chap and all of the flaking within 3 days. Love it. ",0
"My love affair with Too Faced just keeps growing stronger! This wonderful duo is my go-to buddy on hectic mornings, especially those ""Manic Mondays""! The pretty colors perk up my face and brighten my eyes dramatically. I don't look tired when I feel drained. I hope that Too Faced places this duo in its regular list, rather than keeping it as a special. The colors are very easy to apply and blend. A tip: as Too Faced shadows are very buildable, if I'm going for more intense color, I use a sponge tip applicator. If I want a muted look, then I use brushes. I also appreciate the way that Too Faced eyeshadows don't crease by midday. ",2
"My male roommate wears this and I cannot stand it. The scent has a very off-putting note to it, I can't believe it's a 'best of sephora' winner. I suppose everyone has different preferences when it comes to fragrances, but this is one that I really do not like.",0
"My mom gave this to me and I absolutely adore it! I'm addicted to mascara and loved most of the ones in this set. I purchased the first lash stash myself, but i definitely like this lash stash 2 better. It's a great way to try many different mascara brands for a low price. Everyone has a different taste in which mascara they'd enjoy. But I suggest everyone give this as a gift to their friends and family, and get one for yourself too! Hurry, before they run out. ",0
"my mom give this to me after she bought it and didn't like using it. she thought it was heavy for her skin. it is a little - but very little. i like using this during the summer due to the spf 15 aspect, and find it's a good moisurizer. ",2
"My Mom is 90 years old, you'd never think so :-) She's unable to do her hair every day. I used this dry shampoo and it was awesome. It smelled good, and it added volume to her hair as if it was freshly washed! Thanks! ",3
"My mother thinks its horrid to apply moisturizing lotion without a splash of toner. And honestly, I never quite understood. But if you're looking for a toner, and one that is light, easy to use, and provides a base for your lotion... you got your baby here. People have been raving about the condition of my skin. I've paired it with the ""depsea moisture replenishing emulsion SPF 15 sunscreen"" so I can't give all the credit to this product. I am pale/ fair skinned, sensitive, prone to dryness & blemishes, some light freckles. ",1
"My mother tried this cream in a sample some time ago, and she was instantly in love. She said that it truly did lift the skin around her eyes and made her look more ""awake"". She was shocked to see how well this cream did work. Since it is costly, she did not buy it. But she has no idea that I bought some to surprise her with for Christmas! ",1
"my mother worn this scent for ages, and I've been stealing sprizting time after time. I bought this for myself couple months ago. I love this stuff. My boyfriend loves and everyone loves it, its a must. once you smells it, you'll fall in love. ",0
"my newest thing is everything spf. Not only does this meet my need, it is better for me than a lot of other brands. Plus there's the vanity factor of the store-brand users asking ""where did you get that?"" Of course I tell them Sephora! ",2
"My new favorite! Creamy going on, wears well all day long! My lips felt hydrated throughout the day and the lavender scent kept me feeling relaxed. Love the blend of exotic oils and plant extracts that protect my lips from the elements. After hours of wear this lipstick doesn't feel dry or caked on. ",3
"My normal foundation is very sheer, but I use this to kick it up a notch for a night out. It gives awesome coverage but is still very lightweight....great coverave without feeling like you're wearing a mask!!!!",1
"My old tried and true waterproof is no longer produced. I tried so many others this summer with no luck, by 10 a.m. I had black circles under the eyes. I went to Sephora (the mother ship, as my niece and I call it) and explained my situation. A lovely associate showed me this product. This is GREAT! I am back to having beautiful lashes and I do not get those nasty black circles under the eyes. Thanks Laura Geller!!!!!!! ",2
"My only gripe about this product is I wish it came in additional colors, like brown or blue. Goes on very smooth, and the brush is very thin so it is very easy to create a demure look appropriate for work, and a little goes a long way with this. I don't find myself having to dip the brush constantly as I apply it. ",0
"My pakage arrived, and I didn't even have to open a bottle to smell the mini-bar in-a-box at my doorstep! Really strong scented, and the margarita scent is especially ""TRUE"" of bathing in a real margarita. Not good for those trying to 'recover' ",1
my partner has never used facial products and it was starting to show. I asked him to try this product (from the same line I buy) and he loved it. It has dramatically changed his skin that was weathered to begin with.,1
"My sis gave me this for my b-day. I love it! Most scents give me headaches but this is just right. Not too strong and the level of sweetness is perfect. Not too much vanilla like ""others"" I have tried. I will buy more when I run out... I love the compliments it gets me..",1
"My sister absolutely loves this perfume. I buy it for her every Christmas and she always smells so good. Pink sugar really smells like candy. It also lasts a long time. When we go out, I can still smell PInk Sugar on my sister when we get back home!",0
"My sister bought this for herself. Initially I thought it was a little sweet but it REALLY grew on me so I got a bottle of my own. Perfect for daytime. Something a little different. Not too strong, especially if you get the body spray. It puts me in a good mood! I recommend it.",0
"My sister-in-law calls me the red girl and this lipstick fits my wardrobe to a ""T"". It is a true blue red and is creamy yet has staying power when used with a lip pencil. The case is elegant as is the formula. You will not be disappointed. ",4
"My sister just loves this stuff. She is a coffee addict, so that isn't too surprising. Definitely has that warm, welcoming coffee scent. The texture leaves something to be desired (for me, anyway), but she loves it. ",0
"My skin appears healthier, clearer, brighter. Thank you Dr Brandt! I also use your ""Lineless"" system and your ""Poreless"" system to decrease blackheads, pores, fine lines, and dullness. Its so hard to be in your mid-40s and have both acne and wrinkles. Kudos to your treatment systems in truly decreasing my skin issues. I absolutely love how the ingredients, antioxidants, et al really penetrate the skin and are remarkably effective!!!! ",3
"My skin gets so dry in the winter-it turns scaley and peels and it's terrible. I have tried so many moisturizers and none have made any difference. Except this one! When I use this, dry skin is not a problem at all anymore. It's a miricle product! ",0
"My skin has been flaking from Retin-A Micro and nothing has helped with the flakes. I got a sample of this and let me say WHOA! This felt like a parfait on my face, light and airy. I left it on for about 10 mins and upon rinsing voila! my skin was smooth, plump with moisture and flake free. It also has a nice cooling sensation. I was a little skeptical of this $85 mask but it truly lived up to its claims!",1
"My skin is 32 years old, dry/combo and acne-prone. I normally use Clinique's mild liquid face wash, but decided to try the acne line. This wash dried my skin, and didn't improve my acne. I think I'll switch back to my normal routine.",1
"My skin is light/medium and need a yellow base. Linen is the best match I've ever found. Fine lines are minimized and with a primer, it stays on for quite a while. My new favorite. Expensive, but the coverage is great and two drops are all I need. ",4
"My skin is not dry, but it is mature (sigh!). This fdt literally glides on, and gives a nice, soft look. If you have oily skin, you might want to set it w/powder (I always do). But all in all, it's a very good fdt. I recommend it. ",4
"My skin is sensitive, I have rosaccea and it varies from dry to oil in the t-zone. This cleanser balances perfectly, is gentle but very thorough, removes all traces of makeup (including mascara, liner and eyeshadow). It leaves my skin soft but thoroughly clean. Love it - this is a must have for me. ",4
My skin is super oily so I don't find this product effective in making my foundation last any longer. I don't like the sticky feeling on my face after using it either. The Photo Finish Primer - Light works better than this original version.,1
"My skin is very sensitive to fragrance, preservatives and even Mother Nature's winds and extreme heat. This cream has helped my skin in the last month that I've had it. It's a great protectant without feeling greasy. It's a nice, thin barrier between your skin and the elements. The best cream Clinique has come out with. Love it!! ",3
"My skin tends to get a bit drier during the winter so I like to use a good moisturizer at night, but most are too heavy for my oily skin. This one from Korres (one of my favorite product lines) is perfect. It doesn't feel heavy, and doesn't make my face break out. ",2
"My wife has used L'Occitane Lip Balm Sticks for years. It is an outstanding product. However, the two lip balm sticks I ordered recently from Sephora were dried up and unusable. In the future, I will buy directly from the L'Occitane store to assure fresh products.",4
"Name of the product sounds great, you think of lash injection as getting injection of volume, plumpimg your lashes, however, it did not live up to it's name. The mascara, made my lashes droop, and clumpy, and there were no volume to be had ",2
Nars blushes are awesome!!!Especially Orga-m.This blush is just the right balance of color and shimmer. It lasts all day and looks great in the sun. There is no fragrance and it does not smudge. I love it!!!,1
"Nars blushes are by far the best blushes you will ever find. The pigmentation and texture are exceptional. They provide a wide array of colors in both matte and shimmer, so you are sure to find the right blush for you. I have nothing but great things to say about their blushes, they are absolutely fantastic.",0
"NARS blushes are fabulous! The huge range of colors is a lot of fun to experiment with, and the quality is second to none. I love O* - it looks great on every skin tone and really does give you that fresh-O-glow! I think everyone should try it!",0
"NARS Blush in Orgasm is my all-time favorite blush. I will never use anything else. The color is flattering and natural looking, but offers a gorgeous sheen (highlights). Plus, the blush lasts all day. I never need to reapply. My sister has a completely different complexion than mine (my skin is olive, hers is fair) and the color looks great on her as well. Everyone should try this blush!",0
"NARS Blush in Orgasm is the ABSOLUTE BEST blush EVER. I have gotten countless friends and EVEN STRANGERS to switch to this blush.. The color looks beautiful on my fair porcelain skin as well as my VERY tan friends skin. I swear it doesn't matter what shade your skin is, you will look FABULOUS!",0
Nars' blush in the color Albatross is absolutely beautiful! It looks amazing as a highlight on the planes of the cheeks! It's such a gorgeous color to wear with any shade of blush you have. I highly recommend this product!,1
"NARS BLUSH IN THE COLOR ""O"" IS THE BEST BLUSH OUT THERE. IT STAYS ON AND GIVES YOU THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COLOR FOR ANY SKINTONE. AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE I'M NOT AFRAID OF COLOR. YOU CAN WEAR IT SOFT OR INTENSE AND IT STILL LOOKS GOOD. I ALWAYS BUY 2 AT A TIME CAUSE IT RARELY STAYS ON THE SHELF. WAY TO GO!!",1
"Nars blush is the best blush you can get, although it may seem pricey at first, I have never heard a complaint from either of my three sisters or numerous friends that own it. It has a way of complimenting each person and their complexion and adjuting to their face",1
"NARS blush, specifically the shade related to ""the big O,"" is the only blush I use. It gives a natural-looking flush and is truly universally flattering: 3 of my best friends and I all love it, and we each have different coloring. I recommend it to everyone! Bonus - I don't need a ton of the powder to get great color, so a single compact lasts a loooong time.",1
Nars' Bronzing Powder is by far my favorite bronzer. I have noticed that finding a good bronzer that doesn't make your face turn orange like a fake tan is rare. It can also be streaky and chunky and sometimes way too shimmery/glittery. Both the Laguna and Casino colors look beautiful on all skin tones. I personally have very very fair skin and therefore use the lighter of the two and I do know how hard it can be to find a good bronzer. It does have a slight shimmer to it however I like it because it gives a healthy look. I like matching this up with Smashboxes' pale pink blush. Two Thumbs up~!,0
"Nars consistenly ranks highly on the list of best beauty products and their lipgloss is no exception. However, for me I did not really care for the gloss. I love lip products and have tried too many to count. NARS has wonderful color and the texture is smooth, not sticky which is nice but the smell is like plastic and you end up eating some of it at times. ",2
"Nars lipstick in belle de jour is the perfect nude for my light olive skin tone and dark hair/eyes. It looks great with a smoky eye or with just a little blush and nothing else. I have been wearing it for years, and I even got my sister and friends to buy it! The only complaint is the it tends to dry out my lips, but a little lip balm fixes that!",1
"NARS lipstick is fantastic. I have blue eyes, brown hair and light skin, and FLAIR is the best color I've ever worn. It's the perfect berry with a hint of shimmer. It is long wearing and not sticky or glossy.",1
"Nars makes the BEST blush for a powder. The color is absolutely PERFECT!!!!! I generally prefer gel blushes to powder or cream, but if I can't find my favorite gel then Nars powder in Crazed- so pretty- is the only other blush I'll use!!!!!",1
"Nars makes the most beautiful cosmetics and their lipstick is no exception. It's smooth as butter, has a beautiful finish and stays on all day long without drying out your lips! The colors are gorgeous too.",1
"NARS matte lip pencil is the best thing ever. it's long lasting, non-drying, and easy to apply perfectly because it is in pencil form. You wear it and people ask you about your lipstick and how it is so fantastic.",1
Nars Orgas*m I have fair skin and blush typically looks very fake and too bright on my skin. Nars Orgas*m blush is the first blush that I have truely fallen in love with. It looks very light and natural on my skin and gives my cheeks a very natural glow! It's a must try!!,0
"Nasty. Does not smell like apples, unless maybe this is a reference to the poison apple in ""Snow White."" Drydown is unpleasant chemical odor, nothing flowery or woodsy about it. Body lotion is thin & runny & does not even moisturize well. ",4
"Needed a mask to deep clean but not dry out my skin or make it all red. This mask cleansed my pores and knocked out an unusual deep & blind but burgeoning zit that would have eventually erupted. However, thanks to this mask it never made it to the surface! My face felt throughly clean and soft and wasn't red. I am sticking with this product. Worth the price.",2
"Never before have I worn a scent that has caused more remarks from perfect strangers than this fragrance. I have heard comments like, ""exotic, sensual, dreamy and ultra-feminine"" What is funny is that is exactly how I feel when I wear it!\nMy husband said that this is HIS fragrance and insists that I only wear this one from now on.",4
"Never liked eyebrow pencil and never needed it till I got older. When I did need it, I tried several different kinds and hated it, till I found Kevyn Aucoin precision brow pencil. So easy to apply and my brows are very natural looking. This is really the best! ",4
"Never realized how wonderful this product was until I tried it. I'd gotten numerous recommendations from friends about it, but never wanted to spend the money. Finally, I decided to try it and....wow....it's incredible. I love that it's natural, natural looking, the perfect color for any skin tone and never gives me skin troubles. It's has a very faint natural smell, which I like, and is even super nice on lips. One of my essential make up items now. For keeps! ",2
"Never thought I would stray from the Bliss Body Butter, however, this one does it all. It goes on easy, you can dress immediately, no sticky, greasy feeling, the moisture stays with you all day and the smell is addicting. As for the firming claim, I've tried others that claim to firm and found myself itchy all day. Not with this one, it is now a staple in my over flowing beauty cabinet.",2
"Nice colors in a semi-matte formula. While I don't find them super-drying I also don't think they are very moisturizing. That's a minor problem that can be fixed by pre-treating my lips with a lip balm. Most colors - even the ones that won't/didn't work for me, are lovely. I own this in ROSE CREPE and RIPE FIG. I may also get this in GINGERSNAP and TRUFFLE, later. ",2
"nice even coverage, unbeatable value. I wasn't sure when i got this product what exactly it was for. so i buffed it on my face before i put on foundation. i looked in the mirror and noticed, i didn't even need foundation. the name says it all, it balances and brightens your skin, without looking cakey or over done. Love love Laura Geller Products. ",3
"Nice fragrance. Somewhat disappointed in the performance. Perhaps the problem is my hard water, but does not lather well and left my hair feeling very rough before I put conditioner on. Probably would not buy again. ",3
Nice gift. I was excited to receive and had fun trying out all the different fragrances. The problem came when I tried to redeem the coupon. My first two choices weren't carried in any of the stores in my area - and I live in a fair sized market. The requirement to redeem in a store only is very limiting. ,2
Nice set to try Bare Escentuals. The brushes & lip polish are wonderful. The powders are really miniature though. It is fine for the shadow & blush b/c they go farther than the mineral veil. The shadow is too gold for my complexion so I will be handing it off to someone else. ,2
"Nico is a lovely face powder, but that's about it. I'm fair, too - pale even - and it gives me very little color at all. Which I expected after reading the other reviews, but seriously, there is close to no pigment to this, unless you have skin the color of white paper. This fact makes it great for a nice, very subtle highlighting powder, but never as a blush. I love Nars, but if you want a blush, get something else other than Nico.",1
"No exceptions and no price limits, I have tried every full-coverage foundation out there. This is the best! It covers evenly and smoothly, feels lightweight and does not look like I am wearing makeup and lasts even in the Florida heat and humidity. It does not feel greasy and my skin tends to the oily side. The brush is in the compact and there is a little mirror for on-the-go applications. I rarely need a touch up. ",4
"No, I really don't think this grows hair. But as another review said, it seems to lift the hair up at the root line and this does actually make thinning hair look less thin and receding. Not a miracle worker but a nice addition for those with thinning hair. ",4
"No lie. I'm a BADgal Lash Mascara addict! I use this everyday without fail! I love it because it gives just the right lift and fullness, but isn't cakey and doesn't flake. And if I need a more dramatic look I simply just apply a second coat, NO CLUMPING!!!!!!!!!",0
"No matter what you purchase from this line the products will be impeccable. I recently purchased Express the Truth after getting a sample. Soooooooo glad that i have found this amazing moisturizer, no need to worry about my skin this winter. This cream is potent but easily absorbed. My skin feels plump and hydrated without any oily residue. Thank you Ole Henriksen!! ",3
"NO matter your skin tone, this blush gives you the perfection of a dark pink shadow wherever. NO matter your skin tone this blush, it works for EVERYONE.\nIf only I'd found this blush earlier in life, I'd never have wasted all the money I have on other brands... this is the only blush I'll EVER use again!",0
No more eyeshadow in your eyelid crease or mysteriously disappearing. Use this product and your eyeshadow(s) stays put until you take it off. Just glide it on your lid area. You can apply your eyeshadow immediately after putting it on. No need for waiting for it to dry or set. It does so right away. Definitely a great product. ,3
"No one can beat Smashbox's foundation primers. I've tried the light, regular and the one with Dermaxyl. Since I have oily skin, but worry about fine lines around my eyes, I use the light primer all over my face and use the primer with Dermaxyl only under my eyes. These primers go on silky smooth and leave your skin feeling great.",2
"normally I can't stand gloss -Nars' amazing names sucked me in. Much better than a gloss, this lip stain isn't all slickery and tacky, but gives the most beautiful color and shine to my lips - like me, only better! I am sure to become a lip stain addict. ",2
not a good blush for oily/acne prone skin as I have found it to clog pores and turn skin into an oil slick after a few hours. shades work well on lighter skin tone but not as flatering on medium/olive/tanned skin.,0
"Not as much of a ""veil"" as I'm used to ...goes on a bit heavier than normal...but very convenient. Needs to be an available package type to fill with any bare minerals product...but they will need to figure out a good ""fill"" concept. ",2
"not everyone wants to or needs to use a very opaque concealer. I've found that, while on the sheer side, this Highlighter covers most slight imperfections. however, in its use around the eye area, on the top of the cheekbones, and as a tiny swipe down the bridge of the nose, it works wonders for sculpting the face in a subtle way. good for wedding photos as it doesn't read chalky in the flash. very soft, moisturizing formulation. if you need a more opaque concealer, this product may not do the job. but it will banish under-eye circles well, and does not settle in the lines beneath the eye. it can also be layered or re-applied as needed, which can be problematic with a more dense concealer. I love the component, too- it makes application easy. and I agree with the other poster- this product is easily a match in performance for its fancy, gold-tubed 'sister' product, and is much more affordable! ",2
"not exactly waterproof, but is long lasting. i have bourbon and it is more of a medium chocolaty brown. this liner has a noticable amount of glitter in it, is very creamy and soft to apply, and last longer than many i have tryed in the past.",1
"nothing special about this, except you can put it on almost anything. I know it heels my dry lips pretty quickly & I put it on a scar I had and it helped it to disappear. It's really great for any type of dry cracked skin.",0
"nothing special- it's a nice moisturizing formula. my eye area needs a more firming product, and this one did not fulfill that function. this would be a good eye cream for anyone with a very sensitive eye area, as it is very soothing. ",2
"nothing works as well this product. It is worth the price because you only need to use a small amount to get real results. I use it all year round, but it is absolutely essential for dealing with the cold weather. ",4
"Not only does it help your eye shadows go on smoothly, but it keeps the color ON throughout the day, and eliminates the creasing that I used to have. This product is wonderful....don't hesitate to try it! It also goes on so gently that it won't help to create wrinkles. Whether you are young or forever ""39"", you will love this.",4
"Not only does this set have a good cause but great colors as well that compliment each other , my only wish is to know if there are full sizes to these colors esp. the pink & brown eyeshadows , and the last color on the lip palette ( a pinky/brown) ohhh and the colors flatter any skin tone . I must say this is one of the best kits from Smashbox yet !!!!!!! ",2
"Not only do I love the clean scent of ""Pure Grace"" but the consistency of this lotion is fabulous. It just glides on the body and absorbs quickly. It is a great way to layer this fabulous fragrance so it lasts all day (I use it with the soap and spray fragrance). Best of all it doesn't trigger my allergies like other perfumes can.",2
"not only is this product great on the eyelids in its primary function, I also use the TINIEST bit around the outside of my lip line, applied with an artificial bristle brush, to hold my lipliner and gloss in place. I also use a paintbrush from an art supply store with a long, narrow handle to get as much of this product out of its rather problematic container. it's a bit messy but I've found that this helps to get ones money's worth. a great product. ",2
"NOT ony can you add a little to your shadow for a lighter color with a touch of irridisence, but I use them wet (damp) and foil them on the inner corner part of the top lid. That shimmer on your inner corner of lid really makes your eyes stand out! I use a touch to highlight at the browline or as a shimmer liner run right along the top of my regular black (or deep shade). One is like a golden white , like Pearl Sunshine. Then the other is a very light silvery opal with a touch of light blue, purple and plum shimmer when light hits it. It really is different and beautiful on. These are great alone or mixed with your favorite color. You can even mix it with your clear lip gloss as a highight for fuller lips. ",4
NOT overpowering at all. Very subtle and MANLY--none of those frou frou notes or the over the top sharp notes that make you wish there was no such thing as cologne. I love this stuff....just wish I had seen the gift set!!! My poor guy just sighs when I make him hold still while I zap him with this--but he finally admitted he likes it too!,2
"Not so great. I'm over 50 & like many - & far cheaper - loose powders, the ""Foundation"" tends to settle into my facial wrinkles & makes me look even older. It also cakes up over freshly applied moisturizer (& I noticed that reviewers with oily skin don't like this product). It's messy - you can tap the brush as carefully as you like over the jar, & you'll still end up with powder all over your fingers & the bathroom sink. The ""Warmth"" blush is too dark for the ""Medium"" skin tone set & no matter how thoroughly you tap off the excess powder from the brush, it's almost impossible to control the amount of color you get. If you've ever seen elderly women wearing too much rouge, that's what you can expect from the ""Face Color"" in this set. I don't completely hate this product - it does feel nice on my skin & evens out little blotches in skin coloration - but I wouldn't recommend it for women over 40. ",4
"Not sure if this is meant to be a daily facial moisturizer, but that's how I'm using it. I have adult acne and have tried everything, but this product has cooled and calmed my skin and reduced the redness. What a miracle...",1
"Not the best bronzer I have ever used, but it does provide even coverage. The box is very small, and the brush is probably not the best for application, but it works. The color is believable all year round, and it does impart a nice glow on olive skin. ",0
Not worth the money! Sure it will give you those faux fake lashes.. but only if you put on 50 coats and take 2 hours to play with the lashes. I have had many (CHEAPER) mascaras that have done way more for my lashes in a lot less time.,0
"Now, I always lose my drugstore pencil sharpeners, just like I always lose my drugstore sunglasses. When I bought this sharpener, I thought that it would be a waste of money, because I would just lose it. You know the conversation about designer sunglasses: you think you'll lose 'em or break 'em, just like the drugstore ones you've had. And then you get them, and you make it a point to cherish them. Ha, ha, so I guess what I'm saying is that I cherish this $11 sharpener like I would with designer sunglasses. This is like a designer sharpener...from the first rotation of a pencil...it was love. It's the only sharpener that keeps my Urban Decay 24/7 Liners sharp, which is saying something because we all know how soft those pencils are. I love it, and it is worth the price. AND I must say, I have not lost it yet. ",0
no wonder why this product is loved by so many gals. it is awesome. this is the original shea butter cream. all of the others are knock offs. loccitane is the best. this hand cream leaves your hands so soft. and the smell is so pleasant. i have used it for 8 years and will never be without it. when you start sharing it all of your friends will always want to use it. ,2
"Of all the moisturizers I have tried, and I have tried alot, this one is by far the best. There has been a noticable improvement in my skin since I started using it. It lasts all day, is lightweight, and does not make my skin oily. Take care to not get this product in your eyes... ",2
"Of course I have the Orgasm shade (who doesn't?) and it works all year round. Compliments my skin whether I'm tan in the summer or pale in the winter. I have about 4 other blushes, which I never use now that I have the best blush ever in existence. Don't even question it, just buy it. Absolutely amazing.",0
"Of the Grace's, this is my favorite one. I just started using this about 1 month ago and just love it. The lotion leaves my skin so soft and really smells so good. Since I have started using this brand of bath and body products, which was about 1 yr. ago, I haven't even been tempted to try any other brand at all. If you was really moisturized skin, just try this, you won't be disapointed at all. ",4
Oh I used a friend's urban decay eyeshadow in the midnight coyboy. I must say It's pretty cool with the kinda medium tannish color with abit of shimmer. Really brought out my eyes. price abit high though. ,0
"Oh Kat Von D please keep making make up, because I will totally buy it. I have all of these palettes and this one is one of my favorites. It has a variety of textures to the shadows, some are more powdery (yet velvety) and just one I think is actually cream based. A lot of times I seem to avoid cream based shadows because they crease easier... but that one silvery creamy shadow is probably my favorite. I've tried using this palette like an eye liner too, by using an angled brush, and it works great. Love it! ",1
"Oh my goodness! Even at my age, over 50, I have blackheads and oily skin. This product works wonders the first time you use it and only gets better the longer you use it. My skin is the best it has ever been. ",3
"Oh my goodness! These people are not excited enough about this product!!! I got a sample of the hydrating shampoo and conditioner with my last Sephora order. I just used it this morning before I went to the salon for a wet-down cut. My hair has never, ever been this soft!!! I can't stop touching it!!! I have thick wavy/curly hair so I really need the hydration. Plus, I love that they're vegan! I love these products and will purchase full size bottles really soon!! ",3
"Oh my gosh, I really kept trying to like this conditioner, but it made my hair feel AWFUL! It is very thin, so you have to use a bunch, and as soon as you put it in, it doesn't spread at all, so you have to use a bunch more, and you can feel your hair get really sticky and dry as soon as you rinse it out. I have oily hair, and it was so horribly dry when I used then and hard to style. Plus you have to use a ton of conditioner to achieve that effect. I tried different amounts and time left in, and it was always awful and I ended up throwing it away so I woould stop giving it a chance and end up with yucky hair all day. Sorry, Fresh. Love the Lemon perfume, though! ",1
"Oh my gosh! I rushed to Sephora to buy this stuff after reading all the great reviews. I was excited to try it that night, expecting the best! Was I surprised when I put the cottonball to my eye and experienced the worst stinging ever!! Um, yeah it is totally not greasy but good lord it HURT!! I had to wash my eyes for about ten minutes before the stinging went away, then had to deal with the rest of the makeup left under my eyes. This baby is going back asap.",1
"Okay, enough with the superlatives...but one more time, please. OMG! If you don't use this, no matter your age, well let me just say, you don't care about just about everything. Use this once a week, twice a week or every other day this mask ROCKS. Listen I'm not 21 but, if I were, I would beg, borrow or, well maybe not steal, the money to use this mask. Simply put...it is so amazing. Your skin looks like another person. Seriously, look in the mirror and you're wondering who is looking back at you. You absolutely have to buy this. You WILL LOVE IT!!! ",4
"Okay, I am always skeptical of face wash. Nothing ever does what it promises, I take that as a gimme. I just buy it and hope my skin will clear up some but this is different. I bought the soy face wash in a kit called the beauty sleep kit or something. It came with the Umbrian Clay Treatment and the Mamaku Night Serum. I have been using all three products...the soy face wash and the mamaku daily, the umbrian every other day. The pores on face have shrunk back to the way they were when I was 12 or 13. It is freaking AMAZING. My skin has cleared up, too. The Soy Face cleanser does fabulous taking off my makeup and it also tones as it cleanses. My skin always feel fantastic after I use it. I am totally sold on the face wash as well the other products that came it that kit. Highly recommend the soy face wash.",1
"Okay, I hate to even admit spending 50 bucks on lip gloss but after watching the infomercial and seeing all the ads I HAD to try this stuff. My first order was this and one of the original glosses in Summer. It smells good, has a light tingle and by George, it plumps your lips. I admit to having small, thin lips and it doesn't make me look like Angelina but even my mother noticed my lips looking puffier and smoother. My dh likes how it looks too. I like it, I have a sampler of colors, the smooch shade and of course the aforementioned Summer. The XL is nice because I can use some of my non-plumpers with it and get a nice effect. I like that it smooths out my fine lines and increases the fullness. If you don't expect the impossible I think you'll enjoy this product. It is pricey but it lasts a long time. If you can afford it, I would recommend you try it. Pretty shades, very moisturizing, plumps nicely. ",3
"Okay, let me first say that I have naturally long, dark eyelashes, and that I am a mascara junkie. This is a wonderful product! I was iffy about the brush (it looks clumpy), but if you know how to properly wield a mascara wand, you should be fine. My lashes were defined and voluminous, and you can really turn up the heat with a couple of swipes. Also, my eyes tend to get red and irritated with other kinds of mascara-but Lash Hugger doesn't have all those nasty synthetics. Lovely packaging and eco-friendly to boot! Will definitely buy again. ",0
"Okay, so... Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Fusion products, but the color of this particular one is really misleading if you are ordering online. I really thought it would be more pink than it is, but if you like a darker color that somewhere between brown and pink this will likely suit you. The color really just doesn't do good things for my skin tone. ",1
"Okay. So I don't understand exactly how these pads work. I still feel my facial routine is TOTALLY incomplete without them. Even after washing my face, these seem to get out yet more oil and and I can see them cleaning out my pores. They are awesome with no mess. If you are having any trouble with an oily area this is what you need. ",2
"Okay, so I'm totally a junkie for Oscar Blandi, esepcially after buying the tool kit. I loveloveLOVE kits like this, because they allow you to sample products before buying the full size versions. And if you like the full size versions, go buy them and poof! You have travel sizes. I think the instructional dvd is also really useful for people who are not very dexterous when it comes to styling hair. DEFINITELY worth picking up. You get a lot of bang for your buck product wise and you get styling tips from a hair guru. ",0
okay so i tested this in-store and for some reason it was much more pigmented when i tried it at home. i have to return this to sephore...it isn't worth $21 since it's a guessing game whether it's going to be more clear or more color at times...ultimately not worth it. it's too bad b/c the color that came out in the store was great and the consistency is better than most i've tried. ,1
"Okay, so... sad story. I recently lost my brother and, well I've been doing more than my fair share of crying. I had a sample of this eye creme and I started using it morning and night. Immediately it soothed my poor eye area and really reduced the puffiness that I was really suffering from. It actually makes me look refreshed and rested, neither of which I currently am. I will be purchasing this product ASAP as I'm almost out of my sample!!! Kudo's Ole Henriksen, you have done it again. I love your products. ",1
"Okay. This stuff flies everywhere so be sure NOT to breathe in when applying or it goes to the back of your throat & you taste it. Yum. So hold your breath until your done dusting or walk away from the cloud of powder. It makes parts of your dry skin stand out. You end up spilling a lot so be prepared. It can cake in some places unless your buff out with different brushes. I've tried several makeup brushes with this and am still looking for a good match. The matching brush is $39...the powder is already $30. If you have 5 other makeup brushes already...most people won't feel like shelling out the extra $39 for the matching brush. At times it makes my skin look pasty. I like the blending ability & jar design of Bare Escentials Mineral Veil better but I like the absorption power of this powder (it keeps the skin from ""oiling"" up). I found I can wear this only after applying foundation & NOT by itself, it's too sheer. ",2
"Ok, for the price it's worth it, for the ingredients it's worth it, for the color it's worth it, for the quality it's worth it! I love my TIPSY and BLUSHING BRIDE! They make my face look toned and flawless! ",0
"Ok I am not a finished product person; I tend to skip lipstick een though I wear foundation blush and sometimes eyeshadow. I always felt lipstick was too dressed up for me. I first got a Bare Escantuals buxon lipstick in a kit at Norsdtroms and loved it. I bought this kit for summer and now am a daily user. These four are all great shades and subtle so you look finished and not too made up. Finally a lip product that has caused me to use it and finish the look and look better put together. I love all the colors that look good on yu without making you look ""all lips."" ",4
"OK, I have to be honest. I bought this BE collection for the brushes. I have almost every brush BE makes. The colors look good on my fair skin but I always consider the brushes when deciding to buy a collection. These two brushes are wonderful, the blending brush is fabulous for blending the lines between foundation and blush and any other use you can think of. The bristles are less bushy than other BE facial brushes so the precision is good. And, if you haven't tried applying eyeliner, wet or dry, using the wider eyeliner brushes, then you are missing out. I won't ever use skinny eyeliner brushes again. The colors in this collection are soft and lovely, a wonderful daytime look. They are especially good on fair to light complexions like mine. The lip gloss is very sheer and ideal alone or over another color. ",4
"Ok, it took a few times of using this to get use to it at first but now I love it. It doesn't smear or come off if you cry or swim but it easily comes off with warm water and a little rubbing. I don't know that it's all it says it is ""false eyelash-like"" but I love the wearability of this mascara. ",2
ok--I went nuts on these colors. Got the smog mixed up with Vapor--VAPOR is shiny--Smog is a gorgeous gentle golden brown--green goddess is a neat green--and the Last Call makes my green eyes --WOW!-- This eyeshadow with UD primer stays on and on--and mix very easily--use with a light hand though if you are not feeling adventurous! ,2
Ok let me start by saying a powder facial cleanser takes getting used to but what a great product it leaves my skin soft and feeling very clean. I have oily skin and these products have done wonders for my complexion and have helped greatly reduce my breakouts. I am a huge fan of bare escentuals and these products just prove once again why. ,2
Ok so I am now over 50 and fab but my right eyebrow was obviously thinning. This product fills that spot in looks totally natural then I bought one for my daughter who had overplucked her brows and had to draw them on everyday(not a good look) This product filled in the gaps and gave her back a natural fresh look! ,3
"OK, so I don't use this product for its intended purpose- which is to make your legs shine- I wear a lot of jeans. But the smell is AMAZING so I actually use it like a solid scent and just rub it on my neck and wrist. It smells soooo good! ",1
ok so i have really pigmented lips and this lipstick gave me a great nude color which i loooooovveeeee! its also super easy to apply compared to other lipstick brands but it dries out my lips a bit after wear.,0
"Ok, so when I was 10, the freckles were cute, at 51 though they call them 'age spots', which is a bummer. But to show you how great Clarins products are when you stay with them, NO ONE BELIEVES I'M 51!!!!! My skin has a clear-radiance to it now. It is soft, with a few faint lines and no wrinkles. This is the best way to try a top of the line product that will pay off with compliments like, ""No way, you're 50!"" It is even reversing the sun damage that my husband had to his face from being a mail man for 28 yrs. His lines and wrinkles are dimishing and his skin is becoming more smooth and softer too. It's well worth the money!! ",3
"OK, the color and texture of this lip gloss is fantastic. The only problem I have with it is the annoying container, which has a thing you turn to dispense the product. It is hard to figure out how much is too much. ",3
"Ok, this stuff tingles greatly when going on and I get more lipcolor on my brush to apply it to lips! I wait till dry to eat or drink later but I still lose color I was not happy with this and I made extra attempt to look for a lipcolor saver product! Yes, I do find that my lips are quite dry and even chapped after a few hours of having it on! ",2
ok well i have tried allot of 3in1 products and they either left my scalp very dry or my hair a lil to oily but this product has a nice balance and the fragrance is so pure and clean nice bath and body wash not over drying atall,1
"ok, yes, this is a makeup pencil sharpener. but it is a testament to the time and the care Sephora puts into their brand and the care for their customers, as they improved a little thing like a sharpener and made it better. this is easy to use, reduces mess in my makeup bag, and allows me to get more milage out of my pencils. Bravo and Brava, Sephora! ",2
"Ole Henriksen's products are exceptionally effective. These three are ""wonders"" that can jump start your overhaul and provide you with superior maintenance. The ingredients are of highest quality, smell divine and are a treat to use. You will be amazed.",4
"OMG, I cannot say enough about this lipstick. It is rich, creamy, non drying and sheer. My lips get so dry with some lipsticks, but not with this brand. I can't believe I spent $24 dollars on a lipstick, but I think I have found my new best friends.",4
"omg ! i looooooove this brush !!!!! i didn't think i would because when i first saw it,i thought it looked too small,but omg when i used it,i couldn't believe the results ! it was perfect =D go buy this NOW NOW NOW !!! i've finally found the perfect crease brush =D ! the price isn't so bad,and believe me,it's worth it ! ",0
"omg,i love this product !! i wake up with smoother,a bit plumper lips,and i like the way it feels when i put it on...and it doesn't feel so heavy and sticky,but the packaging can be better,a lot better. you can't see through the tube,so it is impossible to see how much is left. also for 50 bucks,the tube should atleast be bigger ! ",0
"OMG! It's all that and more! Try using it with a exfoilant on face, hands and chest, once a week. It's like having microdermabrasion. It's waterproof also, use it in the shower and bath. Espiecially before applying a spray or bottled tan. ",4
"Once again, Nars is the leader in lipcolors! Gorgeous, rich pigments. Glide on smoothly. SInce they are matte pencils, I wear a good moisturizing lip balm underneath because I find them to be a little on the drier side.",2
"Once I put on the Purifying deodorant it's a ""no worry day"" as far as odor and wetness! My friend tried it and has been hooked ever since! Thanks Sephora for selling this product and keeping it in-stock!",4
"Once I saw these shadows, I knew I had to have them. I'm in love with both of Kat Von D's eye shadow palates, so I knew I would like these too. I have both Sixxshooter and King Cobra. Sixxshooter is amazing and applies very well. I received King Cobra as a birthday gift, and those I was hesitant about the bright green at first, it looks gorgeous on. I plan on purchasing a few more colors and would definitely recommend these to anyone willing to try them out. ",0
"Once I started using this face cream, I swear that my face is 20 years younger and have gotten so many compliments, it is better than all the others that I have tried. If you are around my age or live in a very dry climate there is none better!",4
"Once you figure out how to get the color itself out of it's individual case and open the trio case, which really is not hard it's great not to have multiple little separate cases to fumble with. Makes morning makeup routines streamlined and less complicated. Glad I purchased it and I'll buy more if I need too. This allows you to group color families together neatly and conveniently. I love it, so clean and neat! ",4
"Once you get used to the round brush, which does take some getting used to, this mascara is truly what it claims: phenomenal. It is slick, and goes on so smooth, and it lasts all day with no smudging or flaking. I normally use Chanel and this easily rivals it. ",1
"Once you get used to using this as part of your daily routine, you'll feel naked without it! Lightweight, light diffusing and oil absorbing, this is my go to must have base coast for putting my best face forward!!",2
Once you try aqua eyes you will never go back to regular eyeliner. I used to be a smashbox cream eyeliner but noo more. Make for ever is creamy goes on smooth and last all day. Thanks sephora for getting me to try this product...no I am forever going to use Make Up for ever! ,2
"On days when I have to get up at 4 AM for work, this is like a gift from above. I look BETTER than if I had gotten 8+ hours of sleep. This a must have for any early risers or just those of us with chronic dark circles. ",0
"One of the best products on the market. Unfortunately we can't get it in Europe. Sephora France told me in Nice that they tried to get several times. Anyway - we have a goof reason to come to America. Thanks to Dermadoctor. But it's expensive, isn't it?",3
"One of the Sephora sale people convinced me to use the Enlighten Me Pigment Lightening Serum from this product line and I didn't like it, but I wanted something to help my skin glow so I tried the Truth Serum because of its vitamin C content. The first few weeks, I didn't notice any difference in my skin or maybe I wasn't paying attention but now my skins feels definitely smoother. I also read somewhere that if you used vitamin C on your under eye area, it prevents those white bumps or milia that show up. I have a few of those under my eyes so I decide to try this serum directly on them and it reduced them a great deal, at least flattening them. Impressive since I'm not used to expecting significant results from skin care products in general! It does feel slippery when you put it on (like it won't absorb) but if you keep rubbing it in, the slipperiness goes away. I love the orange citrus smell. I don't have problems with lines or a lack of tight skin so I can't comment on how this serum works on those problems, but it seems like it would help those kinds of problems too. My skin feels much healthier and hydrated after using this serum. It's become a permanent part of my skin regime.",2
"One previous reviewer said this was too faint. I use it just to fill in gaps. I have a scar under one eyebrow, and filling it in is noticeable if I use pencil or powder products. This brow pen fills in the space but doesn't look harsh. I like it ",4
"One thing that attracted me to this product was the ""foaming cleanser"" title blazing across its packing. However, the product does NOT foam. It cleans nicely though and it leaves your face smooth...and, it's fairly inexpensive. ",1
"Only 2 things wrong with this: a bit large to fit in my purse, and not refillable. The brush is nice and soft, and the mineral veil is one of the best products ever invented to give my skin a nice matte finish, minizing the look of pores, but without a cakey look ",3
"Only downfall is that I wish it smelled stronger, more like the conditioner balm stuff in this line. However, if you use everything together, it makes a great final product. This stuff made my hair soft and shiny which is great because I have VERY thick hair so no matter how healthy it is, it always looks heavy and not pretty. I didn't heed the advice about not using too much because it actually took quite a bit on my hair, but if you have thin hair then yeah don't use too much. ",0
"Only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that you still have to use your finger after you apply to really get the color on right. So, it does glide on and the lipgloss type applicator is totally cool but it is not ""hands free""! ",2
"Ordered this to try Ojon, now I am hooked. I have colored my hair for 30+ years. Beautician told me due gray hair invading lost shine and hair is coarser. Since starting Ojon it's back to shiny soft great strands. Awesome products! Love the leave in glossing cream! ",3
"O-r-g-a-s-m is my favorite! It's a soft peachy/pink color with a bit of a sparkle tint, which is perfect for evening wear to catch a bit of light!\nIt goes on nicely and you can pack on as little or as much as you like!",0
Org*sm (it wont let me submit the actual name) Is by far the hottest most natural looking blush I have ever used! I will be a life long fan. I apply it to the apples of my cheeks for an amazing flushed look that last and last. I also like the crazed shade for a more classic pin up style.,1
"Others, including my own daughter, warned of a tingling sensation upon application- apparently part of the plumping process. I get virtually No tingling when I apply, although I do get a lovely natural rosy color to my lips. I am skeptical of the plumping.... I don't see any real difference on me. ",3
"Other than its a little sticky after application, I thought the product was pretty good at helping to smooth cellulite and stretch marks. You have to be disciplined with the product, otherwise you don't see results. After the first bottle, I saw tiny improvements in my skin.",1
"Out a new purchase of a powder foundation application brush long enough. This brush has everything I was looking for: soft, natural hairs, precision application if needed for facial curvature and a longer handle which enables you to apply cosmetics with a lighter touch. The more you ""choke up"" on a brush handle the heavier the application of color. I am so glad that I went ahead and made the switch from the shorter handled mineral powder brushes to this one. ",4
"Out of all of the mascaras in Sephora's Lash Stash sampler this one is my favorite. It doesn't clump, you can apply as many coats as you want, and it stays in place all day. I will definitely buy the full size product once my sample runs out.",0
Overall I like all the colors and woud recommend them especially because of the size of the product. It's a good amount in each tube and very easy to apply. Pretty colors and I actually gave some of them as stocking stuffers. Would recommend this to anyone as the price was right and the product is great. ,2
"Overall I like this toothpaste, but I won't be buying this set again because the Mango and Aloha flavors are disguting. The other flavors are great though. They should start selling the Ginger Cookie in a big tube like the Lemonade. ",1
"Overall, I loved the products in this kit. I'm a Bare Escentuals fan/user for over 3 years so I 'm well aware of the quality of this line. That said, I was very disappointed with 1 part of the kit...the dual mascara. The ruby end is just a soupy mess. It comes out in huge globs and is very difficult to get back into the tube. Then, whenever I managed to apply it to the tips of my lashes, it made them disappear and look shorter. I can and will live without using this part of the kit. Everything else is a winner! ",4
"Overall this is a good product, easy to apply and the coverage is good. But for my more mature skin i don't think this is the right foundation for me. It seems to settle into my lines & emphasizes the wrinkles. ",4
"Overall, this product is absolutely amazing. I just wish it had a bent brush, because sometimes, when I try to put on a few extra coats, it goes under my brow bone.\nI find that it doesn't define my lashes and sometimes the clump together. but that may be because my lashes are thick and this is designed for the thin-lashed person. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do. volumeizing, lengthening, etc. etc.",0
"Overall, this was a great waxing kit -- the wax smelled good and was very effective, and the pre/post treatments were also good. However, using a bain marie instead of a microwave is a hassle, and the wax leaves a stringy residue. ",0
"Over the years, I have tried so many perfumes and none have really been my favorite until hypnotic poison. It really is the only one I ever wear now and I can't begin to tell you how many compliments I have received from wearing this scent. The name is perfect for it because it sure does hypnotize the men! Think of it as your secret ""love potion.""",3
"Over the years I have used many, many concealers. Last year a girlfriend introduced me to the NARS concealer. I had been a big NARS makeup (lipstick, blush, eye shawdow) for years. Usually I just bought a concealer from the same brand line of my foundation. Once I used the NARS concealer I never went back. My husband, who occasionally has a ""red mark"" or zit, was stealing my NARS so I bought him his own. ",4
"Peach 42 blush has become my favorite highlighter. My skin is medium tone (inMAC foundation I use NC35-NC37, Stila 60 watts, Armani 5.5). I dust a little on top of my cheek bones, the bridge of my nose, a little on my chin, wherever you usually put highlighter. The effect is subtle and understated. My skin looks glowy and refreshed without the excessive shine and shimmer or curious looking iridescence which many other highlighters impart. I have reserved these other highlighters for occasions that call for my makeup to be a little bit over the top. In the pan the color looks to be an extremely pale light peach and there *is* a small amount of shimmer. This applies very smoothly as well - just like all other Shu Uemura blushes I have tried. This has become a staple in my everyday look. ",0
"Perfect addition to my liner brushes because of it's short, compact length. Ideal for pushing color in between your lashes at the lash line. Brush hairs are a really good quality and this was certainly an excellent investment, Glad I purchased it! ",4
Perhaps I ma too fair but this turned me a toasty orange. It was awful. I liked the texture and had high hopes for it but the color was awful on my. I am very fair with naturally light blond now gray/ash hair. I would definitely try it ion first before you buy it. I wish I had. ,4
"Perhaps I was expecting too much from this lipstick which was rated as one of the best by Allure. It was way too sheer, drying, and would wear off after just a couple of hours. This one is getting returned as I continue my search. ",3
"Perhaps my hair is just too oily after a day for this to be useful, but I could never get my hair to look decent. The smell is also a little odd. I also got very few uses out of the can (maybe 5 treatments?) ",0
"Perhaps the case dimensions were posted online, but I didn't look for them. It's about the size of a credit card and not any thicker than your pinky. However, the eyeshadow is high quality, the blush looks cute on my fair skin and I get a kick out of the hint of something happening with my lips...kinda like someone spilled a pin-sized drop of Lip Injection into the gloss while mixing. The only reason I didn't give a fifth star is that I would have LOVED another compartment for eyeshadow applicators. It would just make touchups quicker to have it right there. ",1
"Perks: it's cheap, it looks good and sudges nicely. Draw backs? You have to sharpen EXCESSIVELY, it breaks off in chunks and gets stuck in the lower waterline and, in lieu of the sharpening, the price isn't all that great. On the bright side: it really does look great on. It's easy to do cat eyes, a 1960s look, etc. I like it in a combo with other eyeliners, too, for a little ""umph,"" but the sharpening...eh. ",1
Philosophy body scrubs are amazing. I keep it in the shower and put it on to exfoliate. Not only does it smell amazing but it works! My skin is always smooth and bump-free. I have been using the scrubs for over 2 years and love them! ,1
"Philosophy could not have come up with a better name for this product! I use it as a sun protector without any makeup, but also as a primer under BE mineral makeup. It shrinks the pores on my nose to a virtual unnoticeable size, and gives me the confidence to go out without any makeup at all! It is the Super Natural Flawless look we all want! ",2
"Philosophy has done it again... I already was in love with Purity, but now that it is in a foam well what can I say It is even better. Thank you Philosphy for this foam cleaner. It made my skin feel soo clean and soft. ",4
"Philosophy products are so basic and wonderful and Hope in a Bottle is no different. This is my daytime moisturizer and I just love how it works all day under my make up to keep my skin moist but not oily. When I apply it I just know it's doing good things to my skin. I does smell a bit medicine-like when applied but once it is absorbed, the smell goes away. There are days when I use a more moisturizing product if my skin feels extra dry but this is my go to moisturizer. I LOVE IT! ",3
"Philosophy's Amazing Grace Layering Collection makes a great gift set, which is what I originally bought it for, but ended up going back and getting one for myself. This is an ultra-feminine feel-good-about-yourself set. ",2
"Philosophy's The Cocktail Party is a great value for three deliciously scented body cleansers. I am not a big perfume person, so these lightly scented fragrances are perfect for me. They actually smell like the real thing! ",2
"Picked up one of these in pomegranate yesterday and it's official, I'm in love! Smooth texture, extremely hydrating, this is definitely going to become a winter staple of mine! The best part? My boyfriend hasn't complained at all about it- and he normally hates the glosses I wear, says they're too sticky... I can't wait to pick it up in some of the other varieties!",0
"Pink Sugar is easily my favorite perfume. It smells like cotton candy, but in a sweet, grown-up way. The scent is great for daytime; light but still sexy. My boyfriend comments on it every time I wear it. Even better, the price can't be beat!",0
"Pink Sugar is so amazing!!!!!! I get complimented every single time I wear it. I'm addicted. I've got people at work addicted to it too, everytime I wear it they say I smell like Candy Floss. It's so good and a great conversation starter!!!! I've been stopped a few times by ""men"" and asked what I'm wearing and that it smells amazing.",2
"please us a light hand when applying these colors, you can always go back and darken, they are really neat together but use lightly and add to desired darkness. I love bare escentials, and I would give this kit a four outta five stars. go for it. ",3
"Powder, in the form of the "" mineral powder foundation"" has its place as a setting powder, or for very young skin to absorb oil, but cosmetic foundation works best for most people when it is a fluid or cream preparation, easy to apply, and creating a flawless, radiant skin tone. Smashbox's Healthy FX foundation has the anti-aging and revitalizing ingredients which really make skin look naturally fresh and almost flawless. I use it quite often now, after spending quite a lot of money on the higher priced Chanel and Clarins foundations for years. It was money wasted, as this foundation is every bit as good in every way. It is weightless, non-greasy, has great staying powder, and doesn't turn colors after application. I'm very happy with the shade range ( I have very neutral beige fair skin) and with the lasting power of this foundation. I apply it over my daytime moisturizer with a non-latex disposable cosmetic sponge which I buy in bulk at Wal Mart. Younger women with normal skin texture won't need anything but perhaps the equally wonderful Smashbox Primer. It is DIVINE!!! I have just ordered the newest Smashbox compact cream foundation, and can hardly wait to see how it stacks up against this one. Smashbox is owned and developed by 2 of the Max Factor family members. I am a cosmetics junkie, and have been for many years, but didn't know this fun fact until I read this in the company profile here on Sephora.com. ",3
"Pretty lipstick but I literally need to put on some sort of lip balm before applying it. Otherwise it does not go on smoothly, and makes my lips feel incredibly dry. Not worth the price tag, unfortunately.",2
"Probably my all-time favorite concealer. I have some acne marks as well as the occasional zit, but this suff really works. I get nice coverage as well as smooth finish! Just make sure you blend it really well. ",0
"Probably my favorite perfume yet. It's distinctive and clean without being sharp, and it doesn't have the bouquet-like richness most other florals aim for (which is why I generally don't like florals to start with).",0
"Product kept from smudging in my most vigorous workouts where I tend to sweat, and where normally my mascara does not hold up well. It also layers nicely over other mascaras, I never use just one, but am now using this one as final coat.",4
"Product worked just as described. Left my appearance as close to perfect as I could have wanted. The only reason I did not give a five is because the primer did not last all day, it seemed to wear off 2-3hrs after application.",2
"Professional brushes make all the difference in make up application and this is THE best crease brush! The shape of the brush is designed to fit in the crease of the eye which makes shadow placement easier. It's natural hair which is best for picking up powder shadow without flaking and it does not shed and blends beautifully. I wash with shampoo, rinse with cool water (never hot) and allow to air dry. ",4
"Pronto makes it possible to skip a wash and doesn't remain visible in my dyed red hair as long as I don't use too much. One 2.5 oz. bottle has lasted me many months, as opposed to one can of dry shampoo, which lasted me one month. Pronto is a real time saver for me, especially because if I discover I've used too much styling product I can quickly correct the problem. I used to have to wash my fine hair if I made such a mistake. ",1
"Pros:\nAmazing volume\nAmazing length\nActually keeps the curl I want (my lashes have a tendancy to go down with every mascara, whether I curl before AND after)\nNO CLUMPS\nCan go from very beautiful, ""feathery"", natural lashes to extreme DRAMA lashes with still no clumps\nEasy removal, no residue\nNo hard lashed when dried\nEasy to layer as many times as you want and still look amazing\nCons:\nFlakes withing a few hours (like 2 - 4 hrs) (biggest con, but the flaking does not smudge, so that's a ""sort of"" pro to the con)\nMascara in tube dries out fast, and even though it's still usable, it flakes faster and a whole lot more\nNot water resistant (but easy to take off if gets wet)\nSuggestions:\nAfter curling lashes, apply desired amount of Bad Gal, then apply one or two coats of a long-wear, non-flaking, curling, volumizing (in that order) mascara. This will reduce the flake to almost none, yet still keep the amazing curl, volume, and drama BadGal gives. This mascara is always in my purse, and it should be in yours too",0
Pros:\nSuper rich color\nGlides on like silk\nColor lasts like a stain\nCruella is an incredibly gorgeous red\n\nCons:\nPencil form means you have to sharpen it (a little difficult to keep the tip from breaking off)\nYou should layer a lip balm over it so it'll stay soft,0
"Purchased Gunmetal and Rockstar-Gunmetal is a dark charcoal gray with silver flecks, Rockstar is a deep, almost black purple-both colors look gorgeous on dark brown eyes. The staying power is incredible-my eyelids are oil slicks and these stay put all day long with no smudging!! Hurray!",2
"Purchased the wrong color initially, you know how it goes debating between two colors, so I returned the first one and got the other color which is the perfect shade for me. Since I began using BE I have really enjoyed her lipsticks and lip glosses. I do plan on buying another shade in this line. ",4
Purchased Undressed Beige because of the rave reviews but returned it. As someone else wrote it's very shimmery for daytime. I was going to use it as a base/eyeshadow primer but changed my mind. It does have a very creamy texture though> Too bad! ,4
"Purchased without having tested the scent, and I was not disappointed. The floral notes were elegant and stated, but not overdone. The vessel handy and compact easy to slip in clutch or small make-up case. ",2
"Purchased Zero because I was looking for a black shadow to use for a smokey eye. It has a very heavy sparkle to it which gives the illusion of being more of a smokey grey rather than black. I still use it and love, but will look for another true black shadow. ",2
Pure Grace Foaming Bath & Shower Cream is one of two I use each day in my shower. The other Philosophy I use every other day is Inner Grace. These two are my favorite. The scent of both is very clean and resreshing and leaves your skin feeling so soft. It's also great as a shampoo.,4
"""Pure Posh"" is a great color! If you like neutral colors with some ""oomph and shine"", and fab looking lips, this is the color! This color oes with everything, add more drama with a great lip liner to make your lips pop! ",2
"Purity cleanser leaves my face feeling ultra soft. Hope in a Jar I was already in love with. Verdict still out on mask for exfoliating, used twice so far & not seeing any results........................... ",4
"Purity Made Simple is a great facial cleanser, especially for people like me who have rosacea. It quickly and completely removes makeup, and I use it to shave my legs. The razor just glides when using this cleanser to shave, and It leaves my legs silky and soft. It can also be used as a body cleanser if going on an overnight trip, and you don't want to take more than one cleanser. It's great!!!!",4
"Purity Made Simple is a really great cleanser, as it effectively removes dirt, oil, and makeup while allowing my skin to retain moisture. My skin in extremely dry, and every other cleanser I have used in the past has only further dried my skin. Purity Made Simple does not. Also, it has a pleasant scent.",0
"Purity Made Simple is awesome. I have had acne all my adult life and this product works very well with my acne medicine. It makes my skin feel smooth and clean. I use it everytime I wash my face and look forward to the pleasant smell and the deep cleansing without the drying It is not pricey but I have found it to give me better result than th pricey cleansers and I have tried many. Like its name it is a simple one-step facial cleanser that is purity. It is now the only cleanser that I trust on my face because I know that it works. I have also become a ""Philosophy girl"" after using this product and now use other Philosophy products. If you want your face to BE CLEAN, FEEL CLEAN AND SMELL CLEAN then try Purity Made Simple..",2
"Quince is the perfect shade of deep rose. Lots of color in this product, a little goes a long way! It is soft and has almost a gel-like consistency that melts into your lips and it has a nice rich texture, very moisturizing. Nice finish. There's shine to it but it is not overly glossy.",0
"Rarely a perfume wearer, this is not like the others. It really doesn't smell liek perfume. It is not too heavy, not to intense but definitely there. I always, every time I wear it, get told by complete strangers that I smell good.\nAlso, for a more sultry scent, try ""the one"" by D&G as well.",1
"Really cheesy, cheap looking packaging compared to the regular Tarte blushes. I find them hard to open and use also. Great colors though, too bad they didn't come in the regular or some other nicer packaging and bag. ",3
Really delivers immediate results. Helped to improve the apperance of my skin. Really easy to use and incorporate into my skin care regime. I would love to see a travel size version since its larger containers are hard to pack. ,2
"Really good - although pricey - product, particularly on flat head or flyaway days. Allows lift and creates volume without weight. Hair doesn't look stiff or feel sticky. 2 oz is best for travel...doesn't last long. I just reordered larger size for every day use. ",4
Really good formula... the lipstick glides on easily and gives a polished appearance... moisturizing and stays on pretty well (I seem to have to touch up more with the lighter shades)... the colors are very nice and wearable. ,3
"Really happy with this purchase! I purchased the smaller bottle, more so for the doll than for the scent. I have heard rumors that the smaller bottles have stickers for clothing, but I did not find that to be the case. Rather, it is like a screenprint...laminated on? Hard to explain, but it is not lower quality than the larger dolls. The scent is flowery and pleasant, nothing too exciting or attractive, but definitely not as sweet/childish as some of the other Harajuku Dolls (Lil Angel, Music..). I would recommend this item as a gift or a collectable. If you are looking for a signature scent, I don't think this is it. :) ",0
"Really liiked the fresh clean smell. i haver a hard time wearing perfumes, if they are too strong or flowery they can give me a headache. this was perfect! the only thing i noticed was that it did not seem to last through the day. other than that it was great, i intend to try all their scents!",1
"Received KenzoAmour as a sample with my order. Sprayed this delightful fragrance on, and the aromatherapy was so clean and musky. The staying power is impressive!!! Thanks Sephora for your fast delivery, because the small sample was almost on E.....",4
"Recently purchased, so the jury's still out. So far, it does hold your brows, but it is somewhat resistant to putting them where you want them. (they sort of fall back downward to a degree) Maybe further use will train them ",4
"Redwood is the perfect shade for Fall/Winter Red, Berry and Wine tones. Glides on creamy and blends well... but stays put and does not feather or bleed. Great shade to deepen lighter lip colors for seasonal transition. ",4
"Removes all traces of even the most stubborn makeup completly, and it doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin. It was recommended to me in Sephora a few years ago and I have been hooked ever since. Great travel sizes,too.",3
"Reviews are important because I'm a skeptic. The reviews of this product sold me. The True Romance Palette (Ludwig) is superb color, long-lasting, easy to apply, wonderful texture. I will be purchasing the other palette also! ",4
"Rich, foamy, softening, cake scented shampoo, bodywash and bubble bath in one product! I truly love this product. I can get everything done in the tub with this one absolutely YUMMY scented product. The texture is amazing and lightly scented and softened skin and hair make this product truly devine. I know I will be trying different ""flavors.""",1
"rivals any couture brand powder foundation. nice and silky, and tons of colors to choose from. used with a brush, it will cover imperfections or give the suggestion of perfect skin. used with a puff, it gives more opaque coverage for a wedding or a night out. I've also used it with a small artificial brush as a spot concealer. if you are thinking about trying a powder foundation, get this product: excellent performance for a great price point. ",2
"Rose Friction 631 is my ""go to"" lipstick and actually a Brown based peachy shade not pink as the name implies. It goes on creamy amd moist, stays put, is long-wearing and never bleeds outside the lipstick line. Bonus is the delightful Dior scent. Love It! ",4
"Say it isn't so Joe!! This can't be discontinued - it's a great product! Goes on smooth, blends easily, looks great with just a dusting of powder over or with your foundation or mineral stuff. Just a dot gives you a wonderful, natural look. Price is right too for such a great product -- lasts a long time. ",4
"Seeing that the price of this product now is only $9, they see that this product isn't that great. I bought it for $18. The white was hard to cover up, then I found myself putting too much black on and then my eyelashes looked clumpy. It didn't really make my eyelashes thicker, it made them a little bit longer but not that much. $9 isn't too bad, but if it goes back up to $18, don't waste your money on it!! ",0
"Senorita Margarita smells good enough to make your mouth water. Plus, I've found it's always guaranteed to make me smile in the shower, even on the dreariest or coldest of days. As with the products in this line, you get oodles and oodles of bubbles.",2
"Sephora finds the best products in each brand and then makes compatible products. Very smart! Bottom line is that I love Sephora's products because they are very affordable and look and feel great. These liners do not smudge and look sooooooo pretty. If you are going out clubbing, this is the liner that you want to wear. ",2
"Sephora was out of Bad Gal Lash so I took the salespersons advice and bought the TexasLash. I can honestly say it is the worst mascara I've ever used. To begin with, it went on in huge clumps and made my eyelashes stick together so I looked like I had 5 big spiked things on my eyes instead of eyelashes. It took me forever to separate them. It also was so heavy it completely took the curl out of my lashes. Then, during the day it started flaking and leaving black clumps all over my face. When I tried to take it off that night, it was a nightmare! Remover, cleansing cream, rinse, remover, cleansing cream, rinse...remover, cleansing cream, over and over. And I still had black under my eyes when I woke up the next day. I do not recommend this to anyone. I'll be returning mine to the store. ",3
"Seriously, UD has the best brushes. This brush provides great coverage/application, is super soft on your lids, easy to clean and totally synthetic. Love love love. I have never used brushes that were as soft as these are. ",1
"seriously, where have you been all my life? i use this not only on my eyes but above my cheekbones as a highlighter. this product is so silky to the touch and easily blends with just the right amount of sparkle. highly recommended! ",1
"Sheer textured... flawless finish... blendable from just warming up the complexion to building up to a gorgous, golden glow. I have very fair skin and this is the most believable shade of Bronzer I've used. Excellent quality and long lasting. ",4
"Shhh, it's my little secret. I use this to fool my BF and make him think I'm not wearing any makeup and I am just naturally drop dead gorgeous. Te-hehehe. It's a bit on the dark side, and I am very tan. I usually dab a tiny bit with some regular face cream, blend it, and apply. It evens out skin tone, offers some coverage, and makes me look healthy. The best part is that is contains SPF and is leightweight. ",0
"silky smooth, great smelling, super moisterizing....this stuff has it all. People tell me I smell good, not overpowering, but good. I think I smell good too...went out and bought several other items from the line.",3
"Simply the best! I have tried EVERYTHING out there, spent alot of time, money.....and this is the winner. It removes heavy eye makeup but does not leave your eyes and skin oily or dry. I make sure that I do not run out :)",3
"Simply the best primer - the new packaging makes sure you use all of the product and none goes to waste. My make up stays on all day and this does not irritate the skin. Might be a little more expensive than others, but well worth it.",2
"Since I am a full coverage gal, I use this on top of a tinted moisturizer (Korres or Laura Mercier; the others are way too sheer), or a light fdt. It gives a more full coverage, but it still looks good. I use a mineral fdt brush and use the sponge for touch-ups. ",4
"Since I brush the brow powder from the Brow Tech powder/was duo onto my brows and then use my ring finger to spread a thin layer of wax over the powder from nose to end of brow, I run out of wax much more quickly than powder. Therefore, I buy this pot of only wax and use it at home (saving the wax/powder duo for travel). It's actually easier for me to use than the small compartment of wax in the duo. Very nice little pot. ",2
"Since I found this product my hair has never been the same, it is shiney, and manageable. I high light my hair, it was looking real dull. I read about this and figured why not try it. So glad I did!!! Everyone asks me what I use...Yes I tell them! ",3
"Since I have started using this product, my skin, (which cannot make up it's mind to be either combo or oily) is now clear. Even at those times of the month when the amount of oil on your face just goes crazy, still, no worries. It feels great and refreshing as a few minutes at night to remove the day's gunk and let your skin breathe. - A ritual I never enjoyed before, But it truly removes all make-up, including anything you've done to your eyes. Wonderful. With a great scent as well. ",2
Since I started using the Ole Henriksen line I am constantly receiving compliments for my skin. I have combination skin that tends towards greasy in the T zone. This cleanser takes care of the oil without drying out the rest of my face. ,2
"Since I've always used wet powder shadow as liner anyway, this is a welcome addition to my bag. I wish Sephora would offer replacement tips, though. I end up with leftover color and would love to switch the tip out. ",4
"Since my eyesight isn't all that great, applying mascara can be an aggravating task. I love this mascara because of the tiny bristles on the wand, making it so much easier to do the lower lashes. And another great about this product - I've had other mascaras rub off under the lower lashes, creating black smudges under my eyes - this mascara doesn't do that. I highly recommend it. ",4
"Since the Becca line became harder to find, this has become my foundation of choice. I have extremely pale, pink skin. Porcelain works really nicely for me in the summertime, when my skin has built up an ever so slight tan. It's a touch too dark for me in winter, but almost every brand's makeup line is. The limited color palette is probably considerably more challenging to women with darker skin tones.",1
"Since there is no such thing as a pencil that really lasts this is the closest thing to one that does. I have the black and the application is smooth, it's non irritating, doesn't end up all over my cheek and is there for most of the day. I have fallen for ""gel"" liner but this is a great pencil when that's what I want to use. Think I'll try the plum color next. I'm an eye liner junkie. ",4
"since Urban Decay brings us such uninhibited glamour in their products [yay!] I was expecting a bit more from their new lipstick. I bought Gash back in the day, and my older tube definitely packs more of a color punch. this current lipstick formulation is a lot more subtle than I expected. still, there are lots of nice colors. the scent is fairly unpleasant but fades quickly. a serviceable lipstick. ",2
"Small, cheap, beautiful colors. Everything you'd want in an average nail polish! I bought a few colors and the bottles are small but nice. Definitely apply 2-3 coats to make your nails stunning!!!!!!!! ",0
Smashbox has done it again...another wonderful brush! The eyeliner brush is great for applying powder eyeliner or cream eyeliner. Has no bristle fallout and feels so soft against the delicate skin of the eye. It's great! ,2
Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer is the BEST money I've spent on a makeup product. My foundation absolutely flows on and stays in place so much longer. And talk about filling in those fine lines! Love it!,3
"Smashbox' Photo Finish foundation primer is THE BEST start to your daily makeup routine. It makes your makeup look flawless in the end. I use it to keep the shine down and make my uneven skintone look flawless. The other great benefit, is that my face never feels oily! It's just like applying a base when painting a canvas!!",1
Smashbox's cream eyeliner is absolutely the best eyeliner I've ever used! It glides on so smoothly without pulling and tugging at my eyes. The color lasts all day without smudging or flaking. What more can I say--it's awesome!!! ,2
Smashbox's Photo Finish Foundation Primer is the best primer I have used. As soon as I apply it to my face my skin is silky smooth. It keeps my foundation in place until I want to take it off. I also noticed it keeps my eyeshadow on longer too! I would recommend this product to everyone! It is well worth the few extra bucks!,0
Smashbox's powder brush is so full and soft. It applies powder beautifully and feels great. Smashbox brushes last and last so It's definitely worth the money. Just use a little brush cleaner now and again and you're set. ,2
"Smells and tastes delicious & feels great, but I wish it would give me some more oompf. Wayyyy too emolient to be of any use once it warmed up to my body temp and the little crystals seemed to dissolve too quickly. Maybe I just need some sandpaper, but this does not have enough punch for my pout. Definitely will use the rest up just for the yummy taste and smell, but I don't plan on purchasing again. ",2
"Smells Beautiful!!! I layer the oil and the perfume for a longer lasting scent. I love it, and I've received lots of compliments. You don't need to roll on a lot, a little goes a long way. My perfume and roll-on has lasted me a long time. It makes a very nice gift. ",2
"Smells good, but product cannot control my frizz on humid days in New England. Have used better products.Pump got ""stuck"" a few times and was unable to use until I could fix it. Would not use/buy again. ",3
"Smells horrible! To be exact, it smells like my nail polish remover, only 10 times worse. It's also really strong, even though it cleans the brush well. After I dipped my brush in, hair begin to fall out from the brush! Definitely did not like it. ",0
smells wonderful - very light and fresh. While I would say that my overall skin is in better shape I haven't seen any difference as far as lightening of dark spots and I have been using the product for a year now.,2
"Smoothed out my skin, within 4 days. I can tell my skin is firmer. I'm taking off two stars because it dried out my skin! So, I'd stay away if you have sensitive skin. And, it pretty much did all it was going to do in the first week, so I felt like I was putting on lotion in vain for the rest of the time. One bottle lasted about three months--pretty good. You're only supposed to use a dime-sized amount, and that makes it difficult to spread to the rest of your face and neck. And oh, no stinging whatsoever! ",0
"smooth... non-sticky...super-moisturizing...no-sting! Add some foxyness to your wake-up!! A little on the expensive side, but worth it! Originally rec'd this LipFusion XL as a sample, and after running out, I was back for more. (I think I'm addicted). ",2
"So amazing. This just smoothes out every imperfection on my face. Even if I'm not wearing foundation, I still like to use the primer to even out my face. Just gives such an overall better finish than foundation alone. Went away for a weekend and forgot to bring my primer, and couldn't wait to get back to it!",4
"So far I have 5 of the colors and every single one of them is long lasting and a beautiful color. Also, on the darker colors when the shine eventually disappears, the color still remains on your lips. It leaves your lips feeling soft and supple. Wonderful lip gloss. ",3
"So far I have Sin (best blush ever), Desire, O (won't let me write out the name because it's says it's a profanity ... LOL!!), and Mounia. All these blushes are pretty colors and you can't buy a better blush.",3
"So far I'm enjoying this product. It will head straight for dry skin on lips and make them darker. You have to keep your lips scrubbed! Otherwise I put on one coat, let dry, and apply another coat, then add clear gloss or chapstick. It lasts at least 6-7 hours for me. ",1
"So far I really like this moisturizer. I have oily skin, but I'm at the age where I want to prevent signs of aging as long as possible. I've been using the cleanser, serum, and this creme and my skin has gone from being oily to fairly normal. It leaves my skin pretty silky, and when I use it overnight I wake up with no oiliness, just soft skin. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it. ",2
So far my favorite eye combo. Love the fact they are already color coordinated for me. I do not have an artistic bone in my body. The enclosed tip sheet makes it easy for me to apply and I'm basically a klutz with makeup. I've gotten many compliments when I wear the shadows. ,3
"So far, so good, but it may be too soon to really make a judgment on this one. After I""ve gone through half a bottle I'll report again. Meanwhile, skin looks and feels fresh and soft after using this product, not tight. ",3
So far so good - it's velvety smooth so my eyeshadow doesn't get greasy nor does my mascara rub off. I have very sensitive eyes and it doesn't irritate the skin and keeps it very moisturized by not greasy. I will for sure buy it again - I LOVE Philisophy! ,2
"So far this polish lasted longer than any I have ever used. Usually after one shower or dish washing the polish is almost all off. Not so with Nars. It lasted on my toes for weeks. Loved the Dovima color and the shine is great. Would like to get more colors, definitely for summer pedies. ",2
"Soft, smooth, and translucent -- and that's just what the fluid in the bottle adds to my face! This is a great product with a slightly matte finish, so the protection for your skin let's you be the one to shine, not your nose. ",2
"so gentle , yet such a thorough clean for your skin. it leaves your skin so clean , but never taught or dry feeling. i could not believe the difference it made in my skin. the best skin of my life and i am over 50.",4
"So i actulaly like the blue one better becasue it's fun and the color is really nice and it isn't a weird color. The black really lays it on and volumizes and LENGTHENS, as does evry color. It does curls by itself a bit not too much though. ",0
"so I had to see what all the hype was and made my first NARS purchase - Orgasm! It really is a great color, its peachy pink which is different than the Super O (which was just pink on me). It looks natural if you apply it with a moderate hand, but you can def pile it on for more color. Great great color for warm tones!",0
"So I have pin straight (actually pointing down to be exact) Asian lashes. But this Shu Uemura curler helps give my lashes the extra boost it needs! It's as easy as 1-2-3. Curl the base, then the middle, and finally the ends of your lashes and you're all set! The only bad thing is they don't sell refiller pads so you have to spend another 19 bucks for eyelash curlers. ",0
"So, I know that Anastasia is supposed to be like the brow expert, and I am certain that she is excellent at what she does....however, while this brow product is good, I do not really see how it ""special"" in comparison with other brow powder/wax duos. Personally, after trying this one and several others, I settled on brow tech by Smashbox (see review) as I just like it a little better and it seems to last longer also. Still a good product though.",1
"So I'm not a huge fan of the formula (too dry, not volumizing enough), but the color is fantastic! Since my lashes are blond, I put on a coat of black mascara first, then use this on top. That way, I don't have electric blue lashes, but there is enough color to make my eyes really pop. ",0
"So...I've been on this never-ending mecca to discover the perfect marriage between a glow-enhancing, seductive, old Hollywood glamour shade of red and a nourshing matte but not too dry lipstick. My search is officially over! Red Lizard is THEE perfect shade of blue-undertoned (good for enhancing white teeth) red and I la-la-love the rich, creamy matte texture! It also stands up fairly well to my water grazing and energy drink guzzling throughout the day.",1
"So let me start by saying I have a brown skin tone. I had been having some insecurities going on with a line I have under my eye which I'm not sure if it's a scar or bag. Anyway I used this and thought it was great over most of my face, but my eyes. It seems like my lines, and when I was tired my bags were very noticeable. So I stopped using it and boom my face looks normal again",1
"So lightweight, and it really works! it fills in my pores, and makes them look smaller. My skin is more even, and my fine lines are less noticeable. My foundation stays on all day with this stuff. It feels so smooth and silky on my skin, I love putting it on!",0
"So many great products in this line I should bragg about each one, but my overall favorite (becuse I personally think that finding the perfect hairspray is near impossible), is the Sheer Hold Hairspray. It's light, yet it holds great without stiffness or stickiness, and DOES ""help"" shield from humidity (very hard to do in Florida). It brushes out easily, and the scent is nice yet light. ",4
"some of the colors in this are not my tastelike red zin I personally think it is a little too redish pink for my fair skin,but on the other hand there are some good colors too like bread pudding and sweet apricot its also very moisturizing ",0
"Some of the prettiest Urban Decay eyeshadow shades packaged in a convenient, elegant container...what a value! UD's eyeshadows are so vibrant and pigmented--they last all day and really make the eyes pop! Definitely worth the price! ",2
Some of these were great--some awful. But a great way to get a lot of samples. They last for a long time--so worth it. some smear a lot--oh oh. Don't all do what they say--there's clumping and not much volumizing. ,4
"Someone knew the words to describe what I was looking for but when it arrived I thought I received the wrong fragrance. I can't picture ,who I could possibly ask if they want it because I couldn't be around this smell. Fragrance is not the puchase to make on line unless you are familiar with it already. My nose must be broken because it is not sensing crisp, carefree or exhilarating. It is heavy, horrible and inspires headaches. ",4
"Some people have complained that Angel is too strong or overpowering. While not all scents work the same with everyone's chemistry, this perfume is specifically memorable, beautiful, and even tantallyzing when used judicially.\nThe vanilla, chocolate and mix of light spices have always had men and women alike and often young men asking me what the beautiful scent is. But I will warn, if you can smell it after you have placed a touch behind the ears, one on the throat and on the wrists--and I mean a touch--you have put on too much.\nThiis perfume 'Less is More.'",4
Something to re[place the Grace Olive oil scrub. I like the old one better but it is great to have one in a bottle smells like Amazing race. I don't like those tub container things who can actually work that in a shower? ,3
"Soooooo many eye catching colors I want them all, but I have only purchased these 3 and they are amazing. Highly pigmented so they'll last forever, amazing colors, lasts all day, and they shimmer beautifully in soft light... * Rated R - looks great pool side *Belly Dance - pure elegance, beautiful combo *Misfit - A great combo for spicing up a casual outfit! ",0
"Sorry to say, because I usually love the quality of Laura Mercier products, but the Eye Colour Pot just doesn't pass the ""stay-in-place-all-day-without-creasing"" test. The powder on the top is beautiful, but the creamy shadow below has zero staying power. ",3
"Sorry you BE lovers, but this is far better. I was a BE Foundation user for years until trying this from a sample. Love the application, and it makes my skin look flawless in seconds without having to Swirl Tap Buff all morning. ",3
"so sweet, so yummy smelling, perfect for a girl like me in the baking industry. I always smell fantastic and my boyfriend LOVES the smell. only downside, I've noticed bees are quite fond of the scent as well.",0
"so this summer i tanned, but i was too dark for my foundation but too light for the next shade up. so what i do is put a few lines of the lighter foundation on my face then i blend it in with the tinted moisterizer to get the shade i need! it works great and keeps my skin feeling great all day long! ",0
So TOTALLY THE BEST!! I love the way it makes my skin feel - so soft and smooth!! This comes from someone who hates the feel of anything heavy on the face. Wouldn't be without it!! Makes me look vibrant with or without foundation.,2
"Soul Owner is my favorite Philosophy product. I have used it for years. Occasionally, I will receive another brand of foot cream as a gift. I regift them, because there is no substitute for Soul Owner; it's the best!!! Soul Owner makes your feet soft while exfoliating them. It is a wonderful product. ",4
"Sounds like a dating profile.\nOpium is the embodiment of being erotic, sensual and provocative. Only those not afraid to portray this should ware it. Its not for the shy introverted woman unless she is dying to unfold in a big way. Its beautiful , powerful and feminine. A fragrance that demands women to ware it proudly and with confidence. A true classic. Try it.",4
Spun Sugar is my favorite Laura Geller baked eyeshadow yet! I have crepy eyelids and have to be careful about shimmery eyeshadows. This new color by Laura gives me great coverage and the slightest shimmer without emphasizing my eyelid crepiness. The color is kind of a green gray so perfect for everyday. Try it! ,4
"Super easy to wear and apply. Gives you great natural color without looking ""fake"" like a lot of brands. Easy to apply with any blush brush, you don't need to buy the $75 kabuki brush. I can't get enough of their blushes. Every shade is gorgeous. I want to collect them all! ",1
"super rich cream, makes my face very feel healthy and soft. helped improve the appearnce of of my skin tone and texture within about 2 weeks. keeps moisture locked in all day without greasy or heavy feeling. love the entire caudalie line! ",1
Surprised that I like any fragrance with the word Rose in it. Ordinarily I cannot stand the scent of Rose in a perfume/lotion. I originally picked this for my niece because she is girly and yet very much a rocker. The name caught my eye. It is a wonderful combination ! ,3
"Sweet, luscious, fruity. JUST LIKE CANDY! I ADORE this scent but wish that it was available!!!!!! I can't seem to find it in Sephora stores any more and I've never seen it in stock online (at Sephora.com). It seems everyone has found out about this tasty (smelling) scent. Sigh... It's also cruelty-free, which is a MAJOR ++++++++++ to me!!!! ",0
"Sweet, soft, deliciously scented, charming & feminine for any age, & a darling collectable tin!!! You will want to collect other ON10 lip balms...I have!!!:) P.S. there is a lot of product in tins...you will be surprised!!! ",2
"Talika will always be in my cosmetic drawer! My lashes have improved so dramatically...they were short, stubby. Now...soft and long! Like ""spider lady"" when I use mascara!! Girls..this is tested and true!! My friends are ordering...do so, NOW..for lovely lashes!! bb ",4
Talk about the best makeup remover ever!! This product is a life saver! It literally MELTS off your makeup and washes your skin to Perfection! I recommend this to all my girlfriends! It lasts forever too... Just a little goes a long way!,0
"Tangerine is my favorite. Excellent scent, yet it doesn't linger too long. Great body wash consistency. Can't beat the price. My husband loves this too, and he hates all this stuff. I highly recommend this product! ",2
"Tbis is a really sophisticated and classy scent. I definitely smell the berries and orange blossom and yet, it is stll"" berry"" much a floral perfume. It is light and lovely and SUPER feminine!!! I would highly recommend this product. ",1
"Terrific fragrance. I have a very sensitive sense of smell and, let's face it, most women's fragrance smell like bug-killer (sorry to say). This has a nice spicy scent but is also light and not too flowery. I get lots of compliments when I wear this.",3
"Thank God for Sephora and other users who write reviews or else I still probably would be wasting time and money trying out different products. I have a problem with wearing eyeshadow and not having it last long at all...actually that's why I don't wear eyeshadow. Now after discovering this mircale product, I'm exciting to play with my eyeshadow collection again...thank you Urban Decay! ",1
"Thank my lucky stars for Sephora's own line of greatness! I have this and its awesome! Basically, any eyeshadow you have, now has the option of becoming an eyeliner that stays put! greatness! but really can you ever go wrong when buying anything that Sephora will put its name on? ",0
"...that I had HAD to try this. I love cinnamon n honey any and everything so I finally tried it...I love it. It makes you feel smooth, and sexy. Plus I really thing it improves skin over time. I'll even add it to my hair every now and then. The scent is warm, spicy and inviting. GREAT for fall. ",1
"That's exactly how I feel when I use this scent. I have to confess that I'm addicted. From the first whiff of the sampler I received with my first Sephora purchase, to the absolute need I had to purchase the roll on vial that I am now more than 1/2 way through in less than a month, I have been sold by this glorious scent! I can't wait to order the full size bottle during the Holidays!",1
"Thats what you get. Kind of boring, natural looking lashes. I personally prefer big fake looking lashes, but that is just me. I wear this one when I'm not wearing much make-up, so it is good for a more natural look...but still kind of boring. ",1
"The 24/7 eye pencil goes on very smoothly, no dragging or tugging at the eye. The colors are vibrant and last all day. I never have trouble with smearing or fading. With so many colors to choose from I can always find just the right shade to match any outfit I'm wearing. I also have sensitive eyes and this eyeliner has been gentle on my eyes. It's a great little pencil!",2
"The beginning of mineral makeup...bareMinerals is amazing and will change your life. I never wanted to wear any kind of thick foundation, but needed light coverage to even out my skin. This was the perfect solution and I have never found anything better! ",0
The best cleanser that I have ever tried. I have combination skin and it is perfect and also it the joy of one product is well worth it. My skin has imporoved over all using tis product along with Hope In a Jar.,1
"The BEST Finishing Powder... sheer... sets make up invisibly... no tint so your make up stays true, fresh and skin appears FLAWLESS! Also apply on eye lids before powder shadow for smooth application, around lip line to prevent feathering and where ever you need oil absorbtion. Does NOT appear chalky or dry... LOVE it! ",4
"The best makeup I've used so far--and I've used a lot! Super coverage and keeps that flawless, matte finish ALL day. And best of all--and this is where many fail--it doesn't settle into my fine lines and accentuate just how old I really am. Always appreciate that Dior. I'm a bit anxious to pick the shade from a photographed color swatch, but found it to be a dead on match--which will help in the future because the one I chose was just a tad too yellow for my skin. Also, my skin had no itchy reaction to it like it does with a lot of these types of foundations. All in all, this is wonderful stuff and I will purchase it again. ",3
"The best product for dry, processed, chemically treated hair. Use once a week for 20 minutes (or more) before shampooing. After blow drying your hair will have more shine and bounce then you can imagine. Even my hair stylist couldn't believe how my hair has changed to a healthy, natural looking state. ",3
The blue is absolutely perfect for someone with silver hair (me)...I bought it in bulk online because the stores haven't had it for months. It's far superior to the other Sephora brands and outshines Benefit by a mile. The new price is excellent. ,4
"The blue mascara is so incredible. After I wore this, my friends and family went out to buy one of their own. Even in the photos, my eyelashes stand out. The blue doesnt look punk, it manages to look classy, yet fashion forward. ",1
The Boogie Nights Eye Pencils are fun colors. The only drawback is that I wear contacts and the glitter in the pencil sometimes gets on my lenses. I'll still wear them because the colors are great but will just have to remember to use a lighter hand when applying them. ,3
"The box says ""a workout for lazy abdominals"", but not so much. The menthol smell does invigorate the senses, the cooling effect does give you a temporary sense of tightening and the caffeine even energizes you a little bit. However, the long term effects are very minimal. The only difference I noticed was a somewhat smoother texture to the skin. This product does not ""sculpt"" anything. ",2
"The bristles are too harsh on this brush. Initially it shed a lot, but now it stopped. The only good thing about this brush is that it actually spreads and deposits the right amount of bareminerals powder. I actually hated the bristles so much that I got a much more expensive soft brush, but it didn't spread the powder as well, so I ended up going back to this prickly one.",0
"The brow gel goes on nicely, but leaves some clumps that have to be cleaned up. It does wear well. I returned this product because after my last plane flight, one of the liquids in my ziplock bag leaked (as usual!) and the pink veneer on the brow gel container flaked off and made a huge mess. Please, Anastasia, choose better packaging!",3
The brush is the most aweful thing ever. I takes me about 15 strokes to just get my lashes coated. The formula doesn't run and thats good but the application takes so long that I hate using it. and it doesn't lengthen or give volume. Good for Work / Day time Mascare. ,0
The brush is too stiff and I will have to use the powder a couple of more weeks when I find a way to incorporate another brush with it. The brush seem to wipe away any blush or eyeshadow that had already been applied ,4
"The brush shampoo is definitely an addition that will stay in your beauty case if you try it. From the first use, I was hooked. It sweeps away all the dirt, oil, and makeup residue on the brush, and leaves it smoother and softer than ever. And the mild scent makes you feel as me feel as if I've given my brushes salon-quality treatment. Now when I apply makeup, my brushes feel fresh and cool on my face. Overused brushes are harsh on the face, and even the least-sensitive skins get irritated at times. Thankfully, this brush shampoo takes away that possibility. ",0
"The camphor smell is a little offputting, but as advertised, it does disappear quickly. There is a ton of product here, and a little goes a long way. It's very, very emollient - excellent for seriously dry skin! ",4
"The cap that was supposed to be air-tight did not keep the contents from drying out. The next day, all I could get on the brush were chocolate clumps that would not spread. The material also dried up & flaked onto my cheeks by midday.",4
The Chestnut lip pencil is a great basic neutral pencil. Blends in with most lipstick shades. It's creamy and applies easy but stays put... does not bleed or run nor does lipstick when used with this pencil. ,4
"The Clarisonic does a great job cleaning. I like to use it in the shower at night. Night cream seems to work better as my skin feels amazing in the morning. At my age, I would really like an 'eraser' attachment for the wrinkles though (just kidding!). ",4
The cleansers are the best and they are great for fair super sensitive skin. Non Drying and able to remove waterproof mascara without irritaing the eyes. I love the sets and container size is generous ompared to other brands. The price is fair and the results I am happy with. This particular kit is a great value since the moisturizer itself is $50.00 and you get he cleansers and eye ceam to boot. ,3
"The cleanser works very well and it does not irritate my sensitive skin but I had to give it away because of the smell. It smells like cucumbers and I really don't like them, but it is a great cleanser.",0
"The clear makeup bag is great, especially when you want to find your product quickly. The size is generous, so you will need a large handbag. The makeup bag is great to carry your products on the plane. ",3
The color goes on evenly and naturally. I use a blend of the two colors for evening and the lighter color for a more natural daytime look. My brows are going gray to match my hair and I LOVE how natural this looks.,4
"The color is an awesome, multi-dimensional black that looks absolutely fabulous! The color also lasts quite a bit, doing the manicure myself and even with my 45 minute showers and washing my hair every day the color lasted about four days before chipping (even longer than when I get my nails done at a salon with their professional color). I also think the brush should be a bit wider to make it easier to put on. But definitely one of the best nail polishes I've tried. ",2
"The color is beautiful, but i got an allergic reaction to this eye shadow and the sparkles are very loose, but the end of the end my entire face was covered in glitter and it was not cute and my eyes were very itchy. so I will continue buying the mineral ones, and stay away from chemicals once again. ",1
The color is great. The idea of anti-aging ingredients are great. BUT... The container is AWFUL!!! It doesn't squirt out and after several pumpings it splurts out with a huge dollop! You waste at least half of it because the pumper sucks. Very disappointed. Will not buy again. ,4
"the color is great year round for most all tones of skin. My face never looks fully ready until I sweep on this color. looks so natural and smooth, never cakey. I've bought it for years and will never stop",2
"The color is nice with this product, although I did think it would have a touch more pink to it. To be fair, the description does say Peachy-Gold I believe; but the look of the color (in the picture) tends to go with the pink tone too. The color is a bit pale for me. I wasn't too happy with the actual consistancy of the product either, it's a bit too sticky for my liking....works for wearabilty, but is a but thick for comfort. Overall, I'll keep the product but probably would not buy again. It's nice for those days I'm going for an ""un-made"" look. ",2
"The color is not as sheer as the picture shows it, however I love it! It will stay for a long time and it feels good, not sticky. It's a great compliment to Nars Promiscuos lisptick, however, both colors by themselves look great, if you are into Nudes. ",2
"The color payoff is amazing; one swipe and it's almost enough to make me look like a clown, so I always have to use a light hand... It gives me a nice, bright pop of color that I adore. However, it just doesn't LAST on me. The color's usually gone on me within the hour. :/ I don't think I'll buy another NARS blush again, even though they're beautiful!",0
The colors are all very pretty and I like to carry this palette in my purse... the gloss goes on very smooth and it gives a nice dewy shiny appearance... would be nice if it had a bit more body to it but overall I like it alot. ,3
The colors are beautiful but the lipstick isn't very moisturizing... it's very shimmery but somehow it doesn't seem to work as a combined lipstick & gloss... I prefer to use a gloss over lipstick to get a better effect. ,3
"The colors are have nice pigmentation. The turquoise color for example, will go on just as strong as it looks in the palette. The Black color is more of a dark charcoal. The rest of the colors have a slight shimmer to them. They all go on smoothly and blend well. Great price! ",2
"The colors are really nice. The shadows are very blendable and high-pigmented but the glosses are really sticky. The whole thing smells really nice and sweet. Since there are 8 different palettes, they would make great stocking-stuffers for the holidays. ",0
The colors are rich-starting with the box this comes in. The eye shadows are all usable colors as are lip and cheek. The brushes make applying the shades easy and the mirror helps if you are traveling with this set. The colors last all day too. ,4
"The colors are terrific and the liners are long wearing. Concerned about glitter getting into my eyes and irritating them but it doesn't happpen. Just the right amount of glitter, not too adolescent. Glides on easliy and stays put. Removes easily with regular cleanser. The case is handy for travel or makeup bag. No more rummaging around to find the one you are looking for. Bottom line-convenient, quality, and fun. You will love for yourself but it also makes a great gift. The price is right! ",2
The colors barely show up on your eyes & rub off easily. And if the powder gets in your eyes it makes them sting & water (even later in the day). The only good thing about this kit are the brushes it comes with. ,1
The colors come on and they stay to play. I love the assortment of vibrant studio colors that are easily blendable and leave my face looking amazing at the end of the night. Thank you Make up Forever. ,0
"The colors in this palette allow you to create a multitude of fun, smokey eyes. A couple of my favs: Use the lighter colors - golds, browns - to create a lighter more subtle smokey eye. Use the traditional greys and black for a more traditional smokey eye, then give it a twist by using the bright blue or green as eyeliner. ",1
"The colors in this vanity are all nice and have good pigment and staying power. I might have preferred less lip glosses and more of Tarte's lip STAINS, but overall, this is my favorite pallet out this season. ",3
"The colors, the brushes and tutorial really make this a TOP of the line kit, plus the variety of looks you can acheive. It is one of the sexiest, on trend and versatile looks I have. I am in my 50's and I can rock this look from classy evening to playfully natural or sexy, ""on trend"" day looks. A defined eye ALWAYS looks pretty! My favorite! You can use it soft, mixed with pastel colors or dramatically classic or have a little fun with your wild side. ",4
"The concealer clumps with my eye cream/gel (have tried with different products underneath) every time. Concealer gets stuck on the roller ball when blending. The highlighter works perfectly. It does brighten my eyes, but not too too much. ",2
"the concealer does not conceal as much as i wish it would: it's still a little dark under my eyes. but it lightened it up without ""frosting"" my face and without melting outside. i liked how it felt, non-oily, i like the ball-idea - i thought it's good coz you don't stretch ur skin too much, loved the highlighter! ",0
"The Concealer Pot contained in this Kit is THE Best! The lighter, yellow based, drier textured shade (on left) blends away spots and imperfections while the Creamy Concealer (right side) smoothes away under eye bags and circles. They may be blended for your custom shade. Set with the sheerest, invisible Powder (bottom of pot). Both are crease resistant. The Powder ""compartment"" is also refillable. Remove sifter and refill!! ",4
"The contrast in color will allow you to blend, or style up your cheeks for any occasion..day, night summer or winter. It has a nice shimmer look and has a high quality feel. This product may come off as expensive, but a little goes a long way and this product will last you a while. I use mine daily and i still see the original print of the patterned squares. ",0
The coverage and finish is beautiful. It doesn't settle into fine lines and I really love the matte finish. Wears very well and I love the color (118) I chose. Use very sparingly. You don't need much. ,4
"The coverage of this product over spots and discolorations of the skin is the best. I have used many high end products. This one works. I could almost go out with just using this product (but, I also like the finishing of the Bare Minerals' foundation).",4
the deep mauve is a beautiful color and the texture of this lip pencil is so smooth. I really love it goes with a lot of pink colors as well as mauve. It even looks good just on it own with a little clear lip gloss. great buy. ,3
"The dermadoctor KP Duty Cream is the best stuff for my arms. I've always had rough, scaly arms. but everyday I put this cream on my arms and it's like, I don't have to be ashamed of rough arms anymore and happy about wearing short sleeves. I aslo have started putting it on my thighs, because they seem to be kind of scaly too.",1
"the description of this product on-line about how it smells it a perfect way to describe it. i can't tell you how many people tell me that i smell good, even when i just walk by them! i have this in pure grace and inner grace. both smell sooooo good. try one and i bet people will notice. it only takes one or two sprays and lasts all day. love it!",1
"The description of this scent, along with L'Occitane's wonderful Verbena products, which I love, was enough for me to be excited about buying this...However, after a couple tries, this scent smells exactly like baby powder mixed with damp white refined sugar...there was no hint of Honey or Lemon when I tried it out; therefore, I reluctantly returned it. I was so hoping it would smell like Honey & Lemon. ",3
"The descriptor is correct. It is sip-RESISTANT, swim-resistant, and sweat resistant. In other words, it does wear off quicker than I would want in a lip ""stain."" I do have the Dolceacqua color and really like it. It is highly pearlized. I find that a quick blot reduces the dryness and tackiness. Still looking for the perfect lip stain though. ",2
The Dior spray foundation is amazing bc it can give you as little or as much coverage as your looking for without looking overdone. It's light and not sticky and can be applied with a sponge if spot treatment is needed (perfect for under eye circles).,0
"The Dominique shade is a clear gloss with a really pretty sparkle, but the gloss is just way too tingly!! It feels like what I would imagine having menthol or peppermint on my lips would feel like. It was so strong that it actually bothered me. It was very sticky as well. Not attractive when your hair keeps getting stuck in it. Just not the right gloss for me.",1
"The eraser pen works because the tip is coarse and slightly abrasive. It literally rubs off the makeup smear. It does it quickly and less messily than using your finger or a q-tip. However, the tip is very rough and needs to be applied gently to the eye area. ",3
"Theese colors in this kit are very pretty,but they also have alot of sparkle I have found that for day it works great if you mix the colors with other glimmers in the same color family to tone them down a bit then use by themselves maybe for going out at night ",0
The experts are right -- you should always wear a primer under your foundation/makeup. This one is the best I've tried (out of 3). It really helps the foundation (or in my case tinted moisturizer usually) go on smoothly and look good all day and night. I won't be caught dead without this primer.,3
"The eyeshadow palette was larger than I had expected and the colors are very pretty (though I would have liked a couple matte shadows in the palette)... I like the brush and eye pencil but once you use them, you can't really get them back into the elastic holders... still, overall this is a great value. ",3
"the eyeshadows are just so/so. They don't have much pigment, and the colors are very light, overall, and similar. But, it's a cute set, and I do love the brushes. The brushes by Smashbox are usually really nice and of high quality . I'd say it's a nice buy overall. ",3
"The eyeshadows are so creamy it's like putting on eye cream that shimmers! I used a smudge brush to put the eyeliner on, but it didn't stay on that long. Maybe another brush would work better, I don't know. But it looked beautiful while it lasted! The highlighter is sheer, I wish it was sparklier...as for the lipgloss...even putting it on with a lip brush doesn't render the same color as in the palette. All in all, I feel like a glowing princess when I use this set. It's fun! Great for a late night out when you want to look awake and angelic! ",2
"The fabric of the headband is ideal for pulling hair back to wash your face. However, I found the velcro feature to be a bit cumbersome in putting it on. I find that my elastic headbands are easier to use for a quick pullback of getting hair out of your face in one syncopated move. ",3
"The fact that I have bought this cleanser more than once means I think it's wonderful. I am not attracted to the scent because I think cleaner/fresher scents, this one is kind of unique. The reason why I keep coming back to it is because it gets off all my makeup and doesn't dry out my skin. I get the largest bottle of this and it lasts quite a long time, I use purity daily.",0
"The fact that you get four of these for the price gives it 4 stars. These are super silky, but they have one downside. The highlighters in the middle are tiny and a little hard to use. You'll run out of it way before the darker shades. I've matched them closely with other shades of shadow I have, so I'll use those once I run out. Word of advice- use a small shadow brush for the highlighters. ",0
"The first few time I tried this I though it was unexceptional. When I put it on it didn't seem to have much coverage compared to other TMs I have tried (it's quite light in the tube). But after using it a few times I realised that whenever I wore this my skin looked fantastic. It didn't look like I had any makeup on, just nice even skin tone, with a beautiful natural looking glow. Can't ask for much more than that, really! I also use this under my Stila IPF with great results. ",2
"The first night I tried this I loved it!!!! I woke up with gorgeous glowing sking. I kept using it and it made me break out so I stopped. I have read that it helps with acne and that is why I tried it, but it didn't work for me. If I didn't break out I would have given it 5 stars--Good Product ",0
"the first perfume i ever owned was white shoulders and this is my evolution of that type of scent. sensual, feminine and sexy. men are very attracted to the scent and i have had many men approach me with their opening line of ""what scent do you have on?"" ",3
"The first time I tried this product I was hooked! Not only does it deliver moisture and help to firm skin, but the fragrance is fantastic! It doesn't leave you feeling greasy-it soaks in and makes your skin feel like velvet. I bought the fragrance ""Amazing Grace"" thanks to this product.",2
"The first time I used this my hair seemed a little dry afterward. It didn't seem to moisturize as much as some of my other conditioners. I have thick, curly hair and I need something that really keeps the frizz down. I plan to continue to use to see if over time it tames the frizz. ",3
"the first time i used this product, the next day i saw a HUGE difference in my skin. it was glowing, sooo smooth, and i could tell the tone was more even. great product! great buy! highly recommend it!! ",0
"The formula for this lip stain is wonderful! Does not dry your lips out at all, and lasts a very long time. The color is a perfect combination of color, sheen, and a hint of gloss. I tried Sugar Violot at Sephora, and ended up loving the color on my skin so much that I took it home that day. ",0
The formula is very good where it really thickens and darkens your lashes... but the large brush is sort of hard to handle... the mascara is great when brand new but seems to dry out quicker than some other brands that I use. ,3
"The foundation colors that come in the box are a little difficult to choose from if you're an in-between shade, but the starter set is a really product to use to get you used to the colors and usage of the product. It gives you all the basic stuff, and then you can go and customize with the different brushes you like to you and their more specific shades. ",0
"the foundation is great- if you've got small imperfections or are having blotchiness, it covers it up perfectly. the best way I've found to apply is to shake the container and then open and just use the little amount that's on the lid, it's the perfect amount for the whole face. use too much and it starts to bring out lines. also covers dark sleep-deprivation circles under the eyes well. ",0
"the foundation primer and the brushes are awesome! i didnt really like the ""best selling"" tinted moisturizer. i will rate a 2/5 for looking flawless with this product. However, I would definitely recommend this package to people who already have nice skin tone. ",1
"The fragrance really smells a lot like the first Covet, just a bit more floral. I really was wanting a tropical smell and didn't find this to be so. It smelled on me the the first Covet. I only like to buy fragrances that come with body lotion and shower gel, so the fragrance lasts longer. All in All in was ok but not WOW! ",3
The fragrances take you away from stress and everyday cares! And they are so concentrated that it doesn't take much to have a great bath experience. Such clever combinations of fragrance make me feel especially pampered. ,4
"The ghd hair products are so awesome. I use this product when curling with the ghd iron or if I want extra hold when straightening, it is a little sticky (hence the 4 stars and not 5). Smell is awesome on all of ghd products. ",1
The glosses: wearable colors that don't wear well. Be prepared to reapply frequently. At least they taste yummy! Sephora online order: took 3 weeks to arrive! (I think they forgot about me.) Inexcusable. ,2
"The Good: Bare Minerals is light and you don't feel like you have anything on. It provides great coverage, overall, and the added benefit of sunscreen and being natural enough to sleep in. This product has helped to clear my skin - which is great. Also, it is so fast and easy, my beauty routine is cut down to just a few minutes.\n\nThe Not So Good: I read other reviews and felt relieved to read that other users have a problem with itching! When my face gets hot, this foundation makes my face itch. Its not awful or unbearable, but it is unpleasant. I would also agree with the other reviewers that the design is VERY messy. My bag has powder everywhere. Also, it does get stuck in any fine lines, especially around the eyes, and for undereye circles, I use Benefit's boing because Bare Minerals does cover as well as Boing does.\n\nAll in all - I will be using this foundation for a long time - the good outweighs the bad!",1
"The graphics on the product are IMPOSSIBLE to pass up! The colors in the palettes are so beautiful on and even just to look at!(FABULOUS!), I HAD TO buy both! Beautiful colors off, and on, they are gorgeous. Goes on smooth and nicely, no creasing and stays on and looks great on. They blend beautifull also. You will love them! ",4
"The green tint didn't do much for my ruddy complexion and I was disapoointed that this product contains oil. It isn't much, but I find myself shiny much sooner than when I don't use this product. Can't they make it oil-free? ",3
"The hydrating mineral veil is nice, i don't find it to be actually hydrating but the slight shimmer in it gives the illusion of moistness to the skin which I like. I was concerned about the shimmer when I opened this but it does not sparkle on my 50- something skin. But that brush...... oh, my.....it's so soft and delicious on the skin. I look forward to the mineral veil application step every morning just so I can use the brush. I would buy this product again but the brush is the star. ",3
"Their holiday gifts are always so special but this one from Philosophy may be my all-time fave. The 3-in-1 hot cocoa is always a joy and together with the delectable and highly emoliient marshmallow creme (PLEASE make this in a full size and in a 3-in-1!) and the absolutely delicious ooey gooey s'mores lip moisturizer, which tastes exactly like s'mores (make this in a 3-in-1 and moisturizer, too!!!) -- the packaging is adorable and this is just the perfect gift. i decided to keep mine! but i will buy more. ",3
"The last thing I want at 64 is big chunks of glitter or caky powder. I am a big bare minerals fan and the Mineral Veil is the perfect polishing top layer. Works in everything but humid tropical weather, alas, where it just sweats off. No caking even then, tho. Extremely refined as are the most expensive powders, but at a small price.",4
"The light brown on the brunette kit is just the perfect color for my brows! It looked great when I had my hair dark brown and it also works now that I have alot of blonde highlights in my hair! I bought this product a LONG time ago when Oprah had Anastasia on her show. And even though I don't use the highlighter, the darker shade, the stencils, and most of the time not even the wax, this product is worth it to fill in my brows. The brush is incredible also! I also recommend the mini/travel version of this product. But most of all, I recommend the Anastasia brow growth serum because then you will barely need this product! Love it! ",0
"The 'light' color is grayish lavender dry and a stunning more 'purply' color when foiled. The dark is nice and rich & plummy. The smoky sequins liner shadow is just sparkly enough and smudges easily for a fabulous smoky eye - the blush is just perfect - a hint of color, fresh is the best way to describe it. And of course, I can't forget the Buxom ... another WOW from BE! Natural, peachy tint and shine! ",2
The lip Balms work wonders in keeping your lips moist. I wear them all the time in the winter and also right before I work out. They come in all flavors and taste wonderful. Definitely a wonderful treatment for my lips! ,3
"The lip pencil wasn't as creamy as other products I had tried, but it wasn't bad. The lipstick is very creamy and the bronze color is gorgeous! I didn't think the look could be improved until I tried the matching lip gloss over the lipstick. WOW! What a fantastic combination! It makes me feel like a million bucks. ",3
"The lipstick is really creamy and rich and the color selection is really comprehensive. It's pricier than a drugstore lipstick, but definitely worth it in my opinion. It lasts long and just feels really good on your lips. Blends well.",0
"The lipstick is silky smoothe, true to color description and it feels good on. The case is simply feminine with a flair for style. Each box has a different insert and depicts our feminine wiles. Love it. ",4
"The liquid liner is wonderful. It's brush allows it to go on either in the thin line or the thick. Plus, it blends perfectly with the matching eye-shadow due. However, the mascara arrived completely dried up and clumpy and is utterly useless due to the lousy quality of the brush. ",1
"The look is like you have fantastic natural lips with a little gloss. By far the best gloss ever, make lips look full and smooth with soft color, need the cargo lip brush-useless with fingers. Not for a high drama applications-need something else for nighttime. ",2
"The Lorac Croc Palette is by far one of the best eyeshadow & blush combos in my makeup kit! [definitely my beauty essential] The colors are beautifully resilient and coordinate with each other perfectly. On top of that, they stay put all day into night. ",0
"The man I bought this for has a beard you can literally strike a match on (he's done it.) So he really, really needed something advanced. It's a battle to get him to use it everyday to help the hair become softer, but I liked it so much when I tried it, I stole it back from him!",1
"The mascara lengthens and volumizes my thin Asian lashes, which is a huge plus for me! I had no problems with the size of the brush and it holds a curl pretty well. However, it does tend to flake a bit towards the end of the day, and it will smudge if you rub your eye (but what mascara doesn't do that?) Considering the price, this mascara is not worth ALL the hype. There are other mascaras that are less expensive that does the same thing. Overall this is just an Okay product. ",0
"The metallic eyeliner is really easy to apply-impossible NOT to get a straight line. It stays on all day and is easy to remove. Only complaint- 1 application is not enough, I need to go over the line twice sometimes three times. ",3
"THE MICRODELIVERY EXFOLIATING WASH FOR FACE BY PHILOSOPHY IS OUTSTANDING! I STARTED USING IT ON MY PROBLEM SKIN IN JAN.'08 AND I LOVE MY SOFT, CLEAR SKIN NOW! IT IS GENTLE ENOUGH TO USE EVERY DAY! CALL ME A BONAFIDE BELIEVER!",3
"The mirror is lovely and a great size to carry in my purse. But the jewels that are so pretty are a bit too heavy to make it a practical item to put in my purse. Sadly, I had to send it back. Hated to because I do love to look at it. But if you want a small mirror and don't want to carry it around, this is a great item to choose. ",3
"The most important thing a woman can do for theirslef is to take care of her skin. There are so many products out there , how are you to know which one to get? Well ladies...im here to tell you that you gotta get purity made simple as your facial cleaner! It is so refreshening and makes your skin glow. Its easy to use and only takes a few seconds. i have tried many products before but this one is my fav and Im sure it will be yours too.",2
"The name says it all -- this is the strongest cleaning product in the Pureness line. It's as gentle and non-drying and pleasantly-scented as the other products, but compared to the other cleansers this does leave you with a bit more of a ""squeaky-clean"" sensation after washing your face -- this might be the best choice out of the four Pureness cleansers if you have particularly oily skin, or need to clean up heavier makeup or dirt from a smoggy environment. ",2
"The NARS Velvet Matte lip pencil creates a perfect sensous pout! Pair it with a smokey eye and a great gloss and you'll look so hot everyone will wonder where the fire is. It's also great for everyday wear. You can use it as a liner or even as your full coverage color! Just like a little black dress, this is one product no woman should be without!!!!",1
"The natural light color was still to dark with my fair complexion,I felt it just sat there,I had to blend it frequently and it just didn't blend well,you can see exactly where I put the lid and lip primer. ",1
"The Nude Kit is perfect to make Fair & Light skin flawless! It includes instructions, highest quality products and excellent brushes. I love them ALL! This is a GREAT VALUE and I have not only purchased several kits, but regular sizes too. ",4
"The only compact powder I can use to set foundation w/o the ultra-cakey look. Works well with fdt as well as with tinted moisturizer. I like it because it does not add color. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does not come with an applicator. I always carry a brush with me, but it if I want to use a small clutch, that can be a problem. Still, I would deffinitely recommend it. ",4
"The only con that i have with the lip moisurizers is that it doesn't smooth over the lips easily. It seems a bit dry, but then once it's on i don't mind it. It looks good, a hint of colour on the two tinted. I would buy again. ",1
the only lashes i wear. they stay on forever and give my eyes that pop that make them sparkle. gone are the globs of mascara that clump up and flake off! once i put them on i forget about them all day long. i just use shadow and no eyeliner and my eyes are beautiful. they are so popular that you need to purchase in quantity! ,0
"The ONLY nail colour remover I'll ever use again. Dark, deep red polish--gone in a flash! Soft cuticles left behind, and a scent that doesn't send my husband running from the room--who could ask for more? ",4
"The ONLY plum mascara that does not make my eyelashes red or purple (who wants THAT?). Very dark, almost like a chocolate brown, and doesn't clump. Very good product. And you're getting this from a woman who is NOT a Benefit fan. ",4
"The only problem I had with this blush was the price. It's a great color on me, and I love the shimmer, but $25 is a little silly for blush. I'd be willing to pay extra if it was especially long wearing or potent or something, but I find I have to use as much and reapply it as often as any other blush. I had a coupon, which was the only reason I bought it, and if I had another and had run out I may consider repurchasing, but only then. Overall, it's a bit overrated.",1
"The only reason for the 4 stars (instead of 5) is because of the price. But it certainly is revolutionary in that you really can spray this stuff upside down and any which way to get at whatever part of the body you're trying to get at! It's non-drying, too which can be a problem sometimes w/acne medication. Fast drying so you can spray and get dressed quickly!",2
"The only reason I give this even one star is for the beautiful apricot color. Unfortunately, the pot is very, very small - it should be wider and flatter - making it extremely difficult to access the product. As one other reviewer wrote, more goes under the fingernail than on the finger itself, even with short nails. PlLEASE, manufacturer, make this blush in a more user-friendly pot! ",4
"The only reason I spent this much money on a product is because I thought it would work, it didn't. I find that using a salicylic acid cleanser on the backs of my arms and legs is more effective than using this cream. I see that most people have had positive experiences with this, but unfortunately, I didn't. I did not use this in conjunction with the scrub, but if this didn't work, I can't imagine the scrub would either.",1
"The Optilusion powder is so finely milled you don't even feel it on your skin but wow what a glowing (not glitzy) look. Quick neutral blush, great lip gloss goes with everything and the great mascara and out you go. ",4
"The orga*m shade of this blush is a staple of my makeup routine. I like my makeup to look natural, not heavy, and this blush goes on like a dream to create a natural looking flush with great contours without looking ""made up."" I hope Nars never stops making this product.",2
"The original is a pretty good product, but like other people said, the pump packaging doesn't allow you to use all of the product, which is SUCH a waste of money. The green primer didn't work for me. I have some redness on my skin, and I didn't find that it improved that for me any at all. The original primer is great, though.",1
"The original primer does a great job and makes my skin silky smooth after i put it on. However, occasions after I used it, I noticed that I break out. The light version of the primer does not work at all for mel. It did not create a soft and even texture. The SPF 15 version of the primer created a smooth texture with added UV protection. It also did not cause me to breakout. I definitely recommend trying the primer with SPF 15.",0
"The other reviews here make me wonder if they put another product in my bottle! This really smells almost like men's cologne to me. It's a good scent but I wouldn't recommend this for someone who likes feminine scents. It lasts well though, the bottle is HUGE! ",2
"The outside of this mirror is similar to NARS products, and it is just the right size for portability. I have used it tons of times since getting it. And you can't beat the price, especially for the quality. ",3
"The packaging is very user-friendly! I've seen another popular brand, Urban Decay Primer Potion. Although it also gets the job done just as well as Too Faced Eyeshadow Insurance, the UDPP packaging needs to be redesigned so customers are able to use all of its product inside. With Too Faced Eyeshadow Insurance, you get what you pay for...and then some more! I don't have to use too much, because a lot goes a long way. This is the first choice i would recommend to anyone who wants awesome eyeshadow primer!",0
"The Perfect Eye Set is a very good value. I love the eyelash curler and the eye pencil. I'm not crazy about the mascara...as a matter of fact I gave it to a friend. But like I said, the curler and pencil are great. This set if perfect for gifting. ",2
"The PhenomenEyes mascara is great! It's easy to use and covers the lashes very well with little effort. The mascara lengthens the lashes and it lasts all day. I've already bought my second tube just to be sure I don't run out. Great product, pricy, but good. ",4
"The picture here does not do this box justice. It has a wooden top and bottom and is suuuuuuper cute. It has 10 of UD's beautiful shadows and a small primer. This is a really good quality product, really good value and would make a great gift!! ",1
the picture on this site makes it looks like it a brownish color on the bottom but its actually goldish. The top pink is creamy but not pigmented enough I really dont see the pink on me. The bottom color could be use as a great highlighter. ,0
"The picture was so pretty and I was in the mood to shop so I had to try it. The colors are great and its like eyeshadow, liner and highlighter all in one package. I'm going to have to go back and get more colors ",3
The pots are really artistic and can go fat or thick depending on how you hold the brush. The biggest problem I have is the brush part keeps coming apart from the handle! is there a way to fix this??? ,2
"The pout, pencil does a great job with not only plumping, but with keeping it in place, no feathering. The color is very neutral and can be used with several of the fusion lip gloss colors. Love both pencil and the gloss. Great deal !!! ",4
"The powder and the brush work about the way I expected - I wear only bareMinerals at this point and believe it is the best makeup I have ever worn. What I like best however is the gel that you can use to hold everything in place. That has delivered unexpected results. In some ways using this to ""arrange"" my eyelashes before adding the powder has made a difference in how full my eyebrows now look. And a pencil just can not compare to powder when it comes to a more realistic look. ",3
The price is terrific compared to other brands. It removes all the make up even waterproof eyeliner and mascara very gently and I have super sensative eyes. I will continue to purchase this product it is now part of my normal cleansing routine at night. ,2
The primer and tinted moisturizer live up to their reputations. The undercover pot is extremely convenient for travel. The tools are great! The concealer brush is my new favorite tool. I plan on repurchasing this - it's such a great deal! ,0
"The primer is good, works well, however too much product comes out of the tube onto the wand. I spend a great deal of time ""cleaning"" up the wand prior to applying. The waterproofer turns the tips of my eyelashes white. I've tried using less product on the wand, to no avail. ",2
"The Prime Time foundation primer is delicious! Just a dab spread all over face makes your skin feel like silk. Haven't really used the eye primer much but I'm quite sure it will be equally effective. Recommend highly. At age 72, anything that makes my skin feel ""smooth as silk"" has to be great. In fact, I recently changed hair stylists, and she examined my face quite closely and then said, ""You have a very pretty complexion."" My first ever complement on my skin. Credit Prime Time or the whole Bare Escentuals line........I love it all. ",4
"the product design of the bottle is very alluring, but the scent is out of this of world. I first was introduced to the scent by a sample found in the Sephora catalog. I wore the sample and the reactions of those around was unanimous. Everyone loved it, especially me. Perfect for going out, or staying in with the man. Excellent scent. I would recommend to anyone, but I'd rather covet it for myself. Hehe.",0
"The product doesn't really supply the type of exfoliation I desire for rough lips. It's alright for when lips are already smooth, but it tends to just sit on top of the lips especially when they are rough. After removal, lips still feel a little waxy/sticky. The peppermint provides a slight tingle that is nice. ",0
"The product has a wonderful scent andfeels great on the skin. It doesn't leave a coated feel like Bath and Body lotions do on my skin. It's light and smells great. However, it doesn't really nourish my skin's dryness. It's alright, but I won't spend money on this again.",2
"the product is awesome at reducing shine, but the color that i ordered on-line was a little to light for me. i needed dark color, which is odd for me because i am light to medium complected. the powder did last all day long while i was at work. ",1
"The product is too deep in the jar and it's difficult to get out. I need to use either my fingernail or a makeup brush handle to scoop it out. Once you get it on, it does make your skin look radiant and smooth. ",3
The product itself is wonderful. I can tell the difference in the quality and that you get at the drugstore. BUT...The color represented on the chart and the actual color are very different. Much darker!,2
"The product skin perfection gel by perfekt is amazing! It's what i've been searching for my whole life. It makes my skin look so silky and flawless. It manages to have full coverage while still being lightweight, and it doesnt cake on. If that's not perfection, I don't know what is. ",0
"The products themselves are good, especially the O-Glow and the brow kit...but the sizes are VERY small. Tiny little sample pots with the liner and brow products. The shadows are pretty, flecked with gold and smooth. ",0
"The product wasn't bad as a mascara but it didn't last the 4 days that it says it does. I still had to reapply everyday. I didn't like the way it felt on my lashes, I thought it would be more of a ""stain"". ",0
The product worked seemingly fine as regards helping to stop feathering and locking color in place although I found it too be drying rather than hydrating. I had to use my Hershey Almond lip balm to get the moisture I thought I was getting with this product. Maybe it's an impossible task to get long-wearing and moisturizing in the same product. ,3
"The purple is very pretty, but these are very hard to wear colours. They are full of glitter, and when I try to wear them the glitter goes everywhere, even w/ primer & a colour base on. If you like glittery shadows then this is for you, but it just isn't for me. I wish BE would make the colours in the regular glimmer formula, then that would be a winner and I would give those 10 ***!! But the Extreme Glimmers aka Glitters just aren't from me. Sorry. ",2
"The Rare Minerals REALLY, TRULY will reduce your pore size; and it's colored! Now you can be pretty when you go to bed. I love the cleanser. It works very well and smells like freshly ironed linen. The size of the set is perfect for traveling. And, it's not liquid and doesn't have to be declared in the airport! ",4
"There are a lot of good eyebrow products out there but this is the best. The texture is very natural and it goes on smoothly. I , too, purchased this after receiving a sample from Sephora. I love the dual pan so I can mix the exact right shade for my brows. Whole-heartedly have recommended to friends.",3
There are blushes and there are blushes but this one is just the right one. Brush it on lightly for a hint of glow. Brush it on with a tiny more emphasis for a glow that radiates from within the skin. Or brush it on with vigor for the blush of a new lover radiant with feelings. Too much? Just lightly rub it with your fingers and it will adjust to where you want it to be. Ever have a blush you have to rub on just to see it begin to appear? Not with with this one. You can control and adjust this blush with the touch of a warm fingertip until you get the exact finish that makes you smile in the mirror. And you can achieve that satisfaction -- and loveliness -- with a tiny application of this superlative blush. Stop hunting and seeking. NARS gives you all you'll ever hope for and more.,4
There are certain brands that never grow old and Versace is on the top of that list. You can always trust this brand for its quality and ability to keep its customers nicely surprised.\nBright Crystal is a great continuation of legendary Versace's traditions of filling the lives of women with flowers that we all love so much.\nI also think this perfume has no age - it is equally wonderful on yong people as well as ladies in Balzac's age.,1
"There are no other colors on the market that can compare to Urban Decay! These eyeliners are vibrant, fun & absolutely stay put! They do not smear like most creamy liners & hold up through swimming & crying, too! These are another staple in my huge makeup kit & the colors add a special pop to make your own eye color stand out!! I love these liners....more shades please!! ",3
"There are some things I love and some things I hate about this kit. #1 the primer is awesome .. as are the brushes and powder. The tinted moisturizer did exactly what I expected it to do, even my skin out but not really conceal, so that was good. But the concealer and under-eye brightener stuff didn't really work at all. Like I couldn't really tell the difference between before and after putting them on. I do love the brushes though. So all and all just buy the lotion and primer and find a good concealer. ",0
The Red Velvet Lip Shine is a great subtle color on my light complexion - would probably look good on most complexions. Don't let the color in the tube fool you - it goes on very sheer with just a hint of color and shine. Does not dry my lips. Great natural looking every-day gloss! Smells fine - I agree with other reviewers who stated it doesn't smell like Red Velvet Cake but more of a pleasant Tootsie Roll scent. ,2
"The regular kind is fantastic- I took a sample on a trip, and it made my dry winter broken-out skin look great immediately, and even cleared it up in about 2 days. But it's too oily for me in summer, and the ""light"" doesn't have the same amazing effect, though it's still pretty great. I never wear foundation; i just put this on, then concealer and powder.",1
There is a step by step guide that is included in the packaging. The guide shows you where and how to contour. So don't be afraid to use this product. It also doubles as a great eyeshadow. And oooh it lights up! ,1
"There is no other product that I would more recommend than this. I love the Urban Decay Primer Potion. It is a primer that goes on creamy, then dries in seconds. You simply apply one coat, tap with your finger, wait a couple seconds and apply the eyeshad. It makes eyeshadows stand out and your eyes will not crease. It's amazing, I don't know what I would do without it. You've gotta try this. ",0
"there is no way I could use this as a leave-in on my baby fine naturally curly hair. but as a rinse-out hair treatment, it is awesome. gives my hair lots of shine and softness. I have to be sure to really rinse, though, as it can weigh my hair down. would be good on dense or very curly hair. ",2
"There is such an array of eye shadow brushes available, but this one is really different. It is round and flat at the top and it is perfect for applying the loose mineral shadows without making a mess. This one is worth the money. ",3
"There's no way I'd wear eyeshadow without priming first with this potion. Glides on, dries in seconds, and then it's good to go for hours and hours. Eyeshadow never creases or even looks ""tired."" One of the staples in my makeup bag. ",2
"The Ruby Collection is just wonderful. It gave me a whole new look which was soft and natural. Somebody told me my makeup made my eyes ""pop""! This is the first time I tried Bare Escentuals and now I am hooked! ",4
The samples are large enough to go in your purse. You several days of fragrance so you can really decide if a fragrance is for you. The only problem is having to choose which one to get in the full size with the enclosed coupon. It's a great deal and I'd recommend everyone pick it up. ,3
"The scent is a little powdery but also has notes that could be found in a men's fragrance. After trying the sampler and wearing it, I decided not to buy a bottle because my boyfriend thought I was wearing a man's scent. ",1
"The scent is light, clean and sweet. Just a hint of smell, but surprisingly it lingers all day long. I work in very close quarters with others, so I would never wear perfume, but this shower gel provides just the right degree of light scent.",2
"the scent of this is not strong at all, i was hoping for an amazing birthday cake batter taste but theres not much of anything. its still a nice little balm/gloss and i like that its not thick or sticky. not much gloss or shine though. ",0
"the search for blush perfection can start to feel like the one for the holy grail. in the interests of saving others a bunch of time and money, I suggest TheBalm. It is easy to use, allows time to blend before drying, doesn't change to a weird oompa-loompa shade and doesn't cost a fortune. Trust me - this is a keeper. ",4
"These are a lot of fun to work with. This is for someone who likes stand out color. The colors highly pigmented and true to form. So if you see it as a bright yellow ... it IS a bright yellow. I love the texture and how easy it is to blend. When blending colors they don't get murky. The price is a bit high ... especially when you want to really ""play"" with them. I wish they would create duos and quads ... so people can have several colors without going broke! ",0
"These are definately sticky. There are 2 colors that are really nice but the stickiness will have me sending them back, I am so disapointed. They are fairly sheer but have a little color in the glamour-full/mimosa blossom. If you like the feeling of regular glosses and like light colors then you will love these. ",2
"These are fine textured beautifully blendable shadows! The Color range allows for day to night looks and the shadow texture for mixing, matching and creating additonal shades. Love it! Plus the case is soooo CHIC! ",4
"These are gorgeous! Just like all theco other Buxom glosses. The brush applicator makes it a lot easier to apply, the colors are beautiful and work well with each other so you can mix and match. If you don't like glittery, sparkly lip color, though, don't get these; they're dazzling! ",3
"These are great!! Easy to use, no waste because you are only using one pod per application and it feels so very nice on the skin! Hydrates well with no fuss. I didn't think I'd like these but now I love them!! ",3
"THESE ARE GREAT FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVENT TRIED THEM BEFORE. THE BRUSH WORKS GOOD TOO. I LOVE THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW THEM IN YOUR BAG AND GO. ITS NO BIG DEAL THAT THERE SMALL, YOU STILL GET A GOOD AMOUNT AND YOU CAN TRY MORE THEM ON COLOR. ITS A WIN WIN ",1
"These are great, they are blendable, buildable, highly pigmented, long lasting and come in beautiful colors. Don't be afraid of the shimmer in some, it doesn't really show up as shimmer, they just give more dimension and naturalness to the color",3
These are great. Tried the sample first and I use it with Philosophy's Purity which helps both... Keeps you from using too much cleanser. Had no problem with it falling apart or not doing what it said... I think the girls who didn't notice a difference probably are young enough not to need much exfoliation. Good for them! I love these. ,3
"These are great. Very shiny and sheer, but give good color. Stay on awhile too. Also very moisturizing...plumped my lips, which I didn't like. A little tingly at first. These are a great product and way better than the glazes. ",1
"These are my favorite eye pencils,and I have used a lot. The texture is creamy and blendable, but once it sets it does not budge. Bourbon is a pretty dark brown made more interesting with a little sparkle,and Stash is a gorgeous dark olive green with a little golden shimmer.Both are easy to apply and very wearable.",2
"these are nice, but very small sizes---note ounces when ordering. i love the full size tarte stains---they go on easily, give a subtle glow and stay on for a long time. they go on feeling a bit sticky, but dry quickly and feel very comfortable. ",3
"These are phenomenal colors for that perfect ""rocker"" eye - nice and smoky and deep. But I learned to put my eye makeup on FIRST, then my face makeup, because the shadow does sprinkle off the brush a bit, even if you tap the excess off first. And I didn't like the flimsy brushes that came with it - I used my regular eye shadow brushes instead. LOVE LOVE LOVE the creamy silver color - makes my green eyes pop, especially with the darker sparkly blue in the crease. I wear these colors whenever I go out and get tons of compliments on how great my eyes look. They don't wear off or ""run"" either. The shadows stay put until I take them off. Highly recommend these for the smoky eye look. ",3
"These are so very easy to use and they work great! The colors are fabulous! You'll love the gold and silver! I wish they'd chosen a different color to include besides black, though. I've got 5 black eyeliners now because black comes in every kit! Oh well, it was worth it for the other pencils in this kit! They're beautiful, don't tug when you apply to your eyelids, glide smoothly and easily and don't streak. You'll love these! ",3
"These are the best retinol treatment masks. They lighten, brighten and smooth the eye area. I use them twice a week and do not experience dryness. And retinol has been proven to reduce the signs of aging. A wonderful product!",2
"These are the best tweezers I've ever used and I would definitely buy them again! They cost more than the tweezers I'd been buying at the drugstore, but the quality is much better and it seems like they'll last longer. ",1
"These are the ""must have"" tweezers of all time. The light is so useful and it also has a little mirror on it. The container it comes in keeps the tweezers safe from all the junk in your makeup drawer. ",3
"These are very creamy and moisturizing... pretty much the same as the Laura Mercier creme lipsticks which I love... while the shimmer colors are nice (especially fresh brown and armaretto), I like the creme shades a bit better. ",3
"these are very smooth and comfortable to wear -- there's something about them that feels very luxe : ) i did find that mine needed reapplication a few times during the day, but that seems normal . all in all, good quality <3 ",0
"these are very yummy, they taste and smell great. Cafe au Lait is one of my favorite shower gels and is just as great in lip gloss. The egg nog is just exactly what you expect, and carmel mocha is just delicious also. they are not sticky, give a great shine w/ hint of color. ",2
"These are wonderful brushes. Excellent application, easy to clean, and barely any loose hairs from day one. The set includes all the basics. I own a separate Sephora foundation brush which I also love. I've tried many other bushes; none compare. ",2
"These blushes are beautiful shades, which I cannot live without. It can sometimes be a beautiful subtle pink or a sweet shade of peach- depending on what you're wearing. Being a woman of medium skin tone, I sometimes have to apply many strokes to get a flushed look.",2
"These blushes are truly worth every penny. They blend beautifully, leave no streaks, and last all day w/o changing colour. The colours are quite unique as well. I have this is a few shades, my favorites being Deep Throat & Angelika.",1
"THESE BODY BUTTERS ARE VERY MOISTURIZING FOR MY DRY WINTER SKIN. THEY ALSO SMELL VERY AWESOME..THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THE SMELL DOESNT LAST VERY LONG, BUT I GUESS THAT DOESNT MATTER IF U USE PERFUME OR EDT ON A DAILY BASIS. ",0
These brushes handle well and do not shed. I like the storage case for home and travel. I am tossing my other brushes and buying another set while on sale for travel and considering a third set to keep permanently in my office. ,4
"These colors and this brush are a perfect combination. I was able to get a look I've often wanted but haven't been able to achieve before. The instructions are very helpful. I can't stress enough how much the brush helps achieve the perfect look. Stuff's a tad messy, though still worth it. ",1
"These combos are a no brainer. Simply add one more shade (lighter or darker than the duo) for depth. These Eye Shadows LAST FOREVER if one keeps them clean & sanitary. I always have my favorites on hand, and they are: Alhambra, All About Eve, Bellissima, Charade, Cordura, India Song, Isolde, Kalahari, Madrague, Pandora, Paris, Persepolis, Portobello, Sandra, South Pacific, Stage Beauty, Underworld, Windstar. ENJOY THE FUN!! ",1
"These cute little correctors are perfect for those tricky to correct areas! Whenever I'm working on a client, I'm sure to have plenty of these on hand for a quick and easy clean up! It helps to work fast and to give you a clean flawless look! ",0
"These daily peel pads are a must for anyone who wants younger, blemish-free, exfoliated skin in minutes. Makes your skin perfectly ready for your moisterizer. Big enough and full of enough product that you can do your neck, decollete, and hands!! Don't forget those hands, ladies. This will keep them spot free!! Great product. ",2
"These eyeliners are wonderful! I have 4 colours. The browns are awesome, but the black is the best black eyeliner I have used. Just enough shimmer and so easy to apply. It will last until you take it off. Smudges to help create the perfect smoky eye.",1
"These eyeliners come in great, rich colors and is so easy to put on. They truly glide on. I wore the gray eyeliner out waterskiing and it stayed on the whole time! I'm not an eye-rubber so I don't know how it handles that but water doesn't harm it at all!",0
"These eyeliners were very disappointing. Had a really hard time getting it to go on. Even after rubbing it on the back of my hand to dull the point a bit, still difficult to get it to actually show up on the lid. ",3
"These eyeshadow duos are fantastic. The color combinations are fun and work well together. The shadow goes on super smoothly, blends easily and stays on all day. It's long wearing, highly pigmented and doesn't crease at all. ",2
"These eyeshadows are the best out there. Yes, even better than MAC (I hear some boo's out there.) I own about 25 of these little beautiful things and I will collect more as long as they are around. They have the best texture, lasting power, and colors. There are a few shades that are better than others, but overall you can't go wrong. ",2
"These glosses are like a cross between the full color lip products and the more sheer glosses. They come with a brush instead of a sponge wand, so more goes on your lip. They don't have as much color as the full color tubes but have lots and lots of sparkle. Great holiday treats. ",4
"These glosses go on so smooth and smell delicious, but they are very sheer. However, I bought this in Gunshine and discovered that the sheer charcoal color is a great darkening agent for lipsticks! Highly recommended to give your lighter shades a darker, glossier tone! ",0
"These glosses weren't anything special - not sticky, fair moisture but the scent wasn't anything special. Not a big jump up from your drugstore ""stick."" Was excited to try them after trying the birthday cake sugar scrub but was sorely disappointed. ",2
"These go on smoothly and stay with you until you make a concerted effort to get it off. Unfortunately I'm test driving in winter and have naturally dry skin so I find it a little uncomfortable on its own. Dab a little burts bees on with it though and you have a lovely, stay put red for the evening. Very sophisticated and bold. Definitely not for the faint of heart.",1
These have changed my skin! (along with other use of Philosophy products) I use these ever night and wake up with clear radiant skin! I haven't had this nice of skin as long as I can remember and I'm so happy! ,0
"These just weren't moisturizing enough for me. They do last a while, but they also dried out the top layer of my lips slightly, so that they felt hard and a little plasticky. Like other people have said, they are a little harder to put on, and aren't as smooth as other lip treatments. And I hated how shimmery the two colored ones were. ",0
"These lip balms are so great. I use them anytime my lips feel dry, especially at night along with Hope In A Tube Eye and Lip Cream. I love the taste and smell. It takes me on vacation every time I use it. It really keeps my lips in great shape ;and helps to prevent feathering and tiny lines. ",4
"These lipglosses are great for an anytime touchup! They colors are very nice and the color actually shows up. they must be re touched if u eat or drink, but it isn't a big deal because the tube has plenty of lip gloss.Its very glossy !!! my favorite so far is 21...i will definitely purchase more now that they are on sale! ",0
"These lip glosses offer great color payoff! I was amazed! They're shimmery, but not tacky, so they look great on your lips. They are a bit sticky, but they last a long time, so it's a good trade. However, I do not like the design nor the quality of the containers and the clutch. The plastic containers looked so cheap and poorly made that I thought at first thought the lip gloss was going to be bad-quality also. The clutch is not durable. The outer layer of the clutch also rips easily. If it was not for the good gloss quality, I would not keep this. ",0
"These lip pencils are the greatest - some of the colors seem to have been discontinued, though. Please tell me that all the colors will be available soon. Color #139 is THE perfect color for my complexion! Please bring it back! Great consistency, easy to apply, lasts for hours and the colors don't 'bleed' like so many lip liner pencils. ",4
"These little beauties are a godsend for oily skin. I'm a bit of a blotting-paper junkie and I've tried so many different brands -- while others are a lot cheaper, or better if your main interest is for a powdery color touchup without having to carry pressed powder, this is the best I've ever tried for controlling oil and shine breakthrough without changing the look of your makeup. The sheets are a lot larger than most other brands, and extremely absorbent, so one Shiseido blotter will do the job of two or three sheets of the other brands; and the powder is light enough that it doesn't leave a noticeable cakiness or color-change on your makeup. Great stuff, I don't leave home without these in the summertime. ",2
These little pots are full of beautiful holiday glimmer for the eyes!! A real must have for the holidays. Easy to apply to eye lids. Feel like silk! Makes me feel like a million bucks!!! A real must have!!!! ,3
"These pads are a great refresher after a long day. They smell absolutely lovely, but not strong. You really feel like you are in a spa. I love using them, but I'm not sure that I see any difference in my skin except texture. My skin is definitely softer. ",2
These pads have changed the texture of my skin. I have received compliments on how nice my skin looks.\nIt is softer and my pores seem smaller. I just love how easy it is to use and what a difference it has made.,4
"These pencils are very versatile and flattering. I can use one pencil color to line my top and bottom eyelashes or use two different colors, one on the top and a different on the bottom. They enhance my eyes without looking heavy. ",3
"These pencils do glide on very nively but I have found that they don't stay on very well. However, I have found that they look awesome if you layer them with a similar colored shadow on top, then the color it crazy and it stays put better!",1
"These people know shadow! This is a great buy. The loose powder is full of pigment and sparkle. The sparkles don't budge either; I was expecting to have them all over my face by the end of the day, but that never happened. I love the shadows from this company, the colour is rich and easy to smudge and blend. ",1
"These polishes are ravishing! I love trendy and classic colors and the Sephora Brand has it all! The polish goes on smooth with exquisite pigmentation. I have many of the shades, and there isnt one i have yet to be dissapointed with! As a matter of fac ti just applied Irridescent plum purple for a job interview on friday! its gorgeous! Thanks Sephora! ",0
"These products are a great addition to the Bare Escentuals product line, after I apply Prime time to my face and Prime time Eye Primer it creates such a smooth canvas to start your Bare minerals products application over. I didn't think I could get a even smoother look than I was already receiving from Bare Minerals products, but I do & now I absolutely love this stuff & it is a must have for me! ",3
"These products are all very moisturizing, the Philosophy line makes you feel pampered and this set is a GREAT buy!! Buy one for yourself too!! The vinyl bag is great to reuse for anything! The scent if very light and smells wonderful! ",3
"The serum feels luxurious, and does produce some glow/dewiness, but doesn't help with dark spots. I used the radiance serum for months and never saw any noticeable results. I did notice an improvement of my skin when using Caudalie products, but then the improvement leveled off. I've found other products since that have helped my skin much more.",1
"These shadows are generous in content, versatile in use - natural or glamourous, day or night - and they last forever! They are great for travel, and for office desks. They're gentle for sensitive skin, too. ",4
"These shadows are highly pigmented, which allows you to go from subtle to super! YOu can apply lightly for daytime, then build for a great night time ""smoky eye"". They stay put all day or night & dont tend to interfere with the other eye makeup that you've applied. ",1
These truly are Philosophy's best products---all in a package worth over $200 that you can buy for $115! So worth it! These are my favorites---amazing grace is the most beautiful scent! Love it! Thanks for the limited edition---i might have to stock up! ,1
these work really well. easy to use. you really could use one ampule two times. i do not like the tast too much but it is better than others that i have used. as a whitener though they really do a good job. you have to be consistent with your use. ,2
The shadow goes on very smoothly and lasts a long time. I was just hoping for a little more shimmer in the colors. There is a lot of product for the money! I was not expecting the compact to be so big. ,1
"The shadows are of NARS high quality... great pigment and blendability. The yellow and black are best but the other 2 are strange selections for a palette.... but peach and violet? The lip colours are pretty, but do not have the stay power of NARS lipsticks. They have a sheerer texture than the standard NARS lipsticks. and come right off. The multiples are ok... I just didn't find this up to par with NARS regular products. ",4
the shampoo has a great vanilla smell to it and gives volume to my thin hair! I would recommend it for people who get their hair dyed/highlighted a lot because damaged hair needs protein and it comes in this perfect botte :) ,0
"The shimmer is not too much and looks nice. Best used with a primer. I also use over top of my other shadow to brighten things up, in the evening. Pink looks good applied over top of another lip stick, just in center, to brighten. The darker brown color could have been more useful, had it been a darker brown/bronze color. Then it could be used as a bronzer, and to accent the eyes. That's why I just gave 4 stars. ",3
"the shu uemera is the most awseome eye lash curler I have ever used.I've gotton so many compliments on my lashes I think I should be a sales person for the product because of all the recommendations I told on the product. I also got one for my sister,mother & daufghter.Even the checker at the grocery store wrote the name down! ",2
"The size of both of the products is much bigger than I had expected. You really get a good amount for the money!!. Both products give you a tingle, but don't make you want to cry. I can feel the plumping!! The color is great for work, where a subtle color is nice. ",4
"The size of this case is smaller than I expected, but it sill holds quite a few items. There is a removable divider (into 4 compartments). It functions well in separating mineral makeup into foundations/finishers, eye colors, cheek colors and lip colors. You could remove the divider and use it for your larger treasures. There is a daisy pattern scattered across the bottom of the case, very cute! ",4
"The Smashbox ""Try Me"" set is a fabulous way to sample a variety of Smashbox's best products. The samples aren't large, but there's plenty of each product to decide whether it's for you (and that's the point, after all!). And they're perfect to tuck into your purse or to take on a short trip. The products themselves are uniformly excellent. I'll definitely be buying some of these in full size! ",3
"The smell is nice but the taste gave me a stomach ache. I have NO idea what others see in the actual product that doesn't last on the lips, but but the packaging is wonderful --very sleek looking, and the mirror inside tops it. ",2
"The smell is terrific, and the large exfoliating grains are great for those of us with oily, rough shoulders, back and chest. The scent washes away cleanly, so it won't compete with your body lotion or perfume. ",4
"The smell is the first thing you notice, roses, it's nice. The product is gel-like. It does not feel heavy, or oily. It absorbs well into the skin, and works great with a moisturizer. It makes my skin very smooth when used under my daily moisturizer, but the product alone does not moisturize. It also helps my makeup to adhere nicely to my skin. I would recommend it. ",2
"The smell of clean...that is the best way to describe this light scent. I love the fact that you can use it as shampoo and body wash....for that heavenly smell all over. This leaves not only my body, buy my hair as well, in great condition.",4
"The smell of this stuff makes the purchase alone worth it. And it does great work with untangling. My hair is an odd combo, it gets itchy and dry, but it gets too greasy by the end of the day. This stuff (with the shampoo combo) makes it so my hair isn't greasy until the end of day two so that's a big step up. I guess I do have damaged hair, but it hasn't helped that aspect. It's just a nice set of shampoo/conditioner but not a miracle worker. I really like the way my hair feels when I've put the conditioner on and not rinsed it out, now that would be cool if it worked that way. ",0
"The smell was horrible, the color wasn't even close to what the picture showed and worst of all it was so dry I could hardly get it on my lips. I love organic products but this one needs a new formula. ",3
The Stinson Beach is a great natural looking color with a hint of shimmer. Looks great alone or over a darker lip color. I wear it over Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey - it's a great combination! ,2
"The StriVectin Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler is just what it says. After only one week of use, there is a tremendous reduction of the lines around my mouth down towards my chin. These happen to be the worst wrinkles on my face. Terrific Product. Try it for yourself. ",4
"The Teddy Bear Hair brushes are soooooooo soft! They feel absolutely marvelous against my skin. I'm usually not a fan of synthetic-haired brushes, but these are as soft as any natural bristle brush I've tried. Also, I love the little metallic bag they come in--very convenient for travel. Great product! ",2
"The texture of this product is superior and is my very favorite of all lip pencils. I have tried many, many more but for some reason, this one is superior. FYI, I have heard it is being discontinued, so I bought 3 more. I always feel like my lips are much prettier when I wear this product.",4
"The tip is so easy to use when making a fine line or a thick line...although it IS true that sometimes it is hard to get the ink out although usually you just have to dip it in water if eyeshadow gets clogged into it. Furthermore, it can be really light on the skin but if you hold the relase button down for a little longer to really soak it into the brush and do a couple more layers, then it's good; stays on all day although it's a bit of a bummer that it's not waterproof so ifyou get dust in your eyes, it'll run all over your face. =( ",0
"The title of the product is confusing but it is an eye make-up remover that is creamy in consistency that is very gentle, removes all make-up very quickly, doesn't burn or irritate eyes and comes off easily with a damp cotton pad. ",4
"The title tells it all. I was never able to use a blush in a way that would give me a glow rather than ""cheek color"". I love the way this all over color in Warmth gives me a natural glow.This is very important when you reach the upper senior years believe me!",4
"The trio kit was a perfect gift my my fiance. He loves this product - it prevents his lips from getting chapped when he works outdoors during the cold, dry winter months. I love this product as well; it is great before bed time although it may be too heavy to apply prior to lipstick. ",3
"The truth serum is really nice day or night, but the gel and sheer transformtion definately would not recommend using these products under make-up. After using for a few weeks nice have noticed smoother, brighter skin, with no irritation at all.",2
The variety of colors make this gloss an easy pick. I like to shake it up with unlikely gloss shades over unlikely NARS lipsticks...Try peachy gold tones over plums and reds for a dramatic lip for evening. ,3
The velvet matte lip pencil goes on great--very smooth and lasts for hours. The only drawback is that it is too fat to line lips...I use it as my all-over lip color which works just fine. I still use a regular-sized lip pencil to line before applying this product.,2
"The Vincent Longo Gel stain was a waste of money. It's very watery, totally inappropriate for lips. It worked ok on cheeks, but be very careful applying it, otherwise you can end up with clown cheeks. It will probably remain in my junk drawer until next Halloween when someone needs some cheap makeup. Sorry. I normally like Vincent Longo products, but this one got a thumbs down. ",3
the whole line is fantastic. i have fine but thick hair and its dry. this stuff is the perfect weight. leaves my hair shiny and hydrated. use all terax products. every time i try something else i come back to terax. ,1
The wild rose oil aroma lifts your spirit at the same the creamy rich therapeutic mask works miracles on your tired vitamin-deprived skin. Absolutely in love with this product! The refreshing mask glides smoothly onto my skin and delivers its promises to add brightness and vitality and radiance back onto my skin. Used til the very last drop :). ,0
The Winter Skincare Rescue Pack is awesome! I have used it for about 2 weeks now and my face has gone from dry and splotchy to soft and smooth. I would recommend this to anyone that has trouble with skin dryness when the season changes from summer to fall. ,2
"They are just so pretty. The colors work well on almost everyone. From very, very light to darker complexions. This is a staple and every MUA loves them (almost everyone). It gives your face a pretty glow - you look well rested even when you're not. Get it - you'll love it!",1
"they are the perfect size and do look pretty good on the top of the eyelid. the only problem is glitter is like actual glitter so i've gotten a few pieces that have gotten into my eyes. they also aren't very long lasting, so it smears easily. ",0
"They go on smoothly, they sharpen easily, you can mix the colors and create your own highlights and shadows. They make my eyes seductive. I use a little for color for the day time and then I add a little more for evening. ",3
"They last long, they have wonderful color selections and intense pigments so a little goes a long way. You can't beat the unique color selections this line offers - shimmer and matte colors alike. Layer on top of a primer and you're good to go all day long! I can't even tell you how many of these I own. ",1
"They're perfect for the purse! Just fill them up with your favorite scent, put them in your purse and off you go! I have 3 for my 3 favorite scents. I especially liked this model because it's slim and pink. ",3
"Thick and rich shea butter. It does work well on both hands and feet. Remember, a little does a lot! Great for both men and women, especially with the hand-chapping wheather that is apporaching. Try cotton gloves with this for an amazing difference in cracked fingertips. One more thing, get the large size so you don't have to come back for more as soon I did.",3
"This a great value and the first time I had tried Vincent Longo's products. Though I don't like the color, the lipstick is outstanding- super velvetty and very long- lasting.Just too raspberry-y for me. The lipliner is a great color combo and the gloss creates a nice look with them and over the lipstick. Very nice, neutral eye shadow colors and the soufflee eye color is very long- lasting without creasing. It is shimmery and soft. Only negative was the mascara. Very dry and didn't do a thing for my lashes. Will look for his lipsticks again. ",3
This all in one from Philosophy is so rich and natural. It moisturizes your skin and you feel so fresh and soft. Wonderful all year round...My fav is Amazing Grace- but I really do love them all..try it..You will never go back to using plain soap again..I promise! ,3
"This a new product from Philosophy for me ~ had not tried it before. I do not notice any startling results for covering undereye darkness and/or circles. It works fine, but I was hoping for a more noticeable difference in using it. ",4
This balm is wonderful! It is so smooth light when applied. I had no problems with it feeling sticky or goopy. Somehow this great balm manages to seriously hydrate and calm dry lips. The great thing is the balm works for any skin; it worked wonders on my cuticles! Smells great; light rose sent not over done.,1
"This balm leaves a fine coat of nourishing non-sticky or waxy slightly flavored balm that soothes my lips and protects them against cold. It is also great to be used before going to bed to wake up with smooth, rosy lips. ",3
"This bath wash made feel and smell yummy all over. Showering with it on a cold winter morning was very comforting and left my skin feeling clean and silky soft. I tried it as a shampoo,too, and it was OK, but as a body wash it's wonderful. ",4
"This beauty elixir is essential for me when i travel, especially for long trips in the air. It rejuvenates my dry skin in seconds, it doesn't feel sticky or heavy. The convenient size is great for cary on luggage, the fragrance is not overwhelming, very earthy.",2
This blush has been on my cheeks for six years! It adds shimmer and color in the right amount and makes my skin have a movie star glow. You can use one swipe for sublty or layer on a little bit for drama.,0
this blush/highlighter is awesome. For a mature person like myself it is a subtle accent to my makeup I appreciate. Nothing is worse than the obvious and this blush is a natural extension to your skin tone. ,4
"This blush in Orgasm is fabulous! The color is very flattering. I was recently complimented on my skin and asked: ""What are you using?"" I told a friend I hadn't changed a thing except for using this blush! I love the compliments! I'm very happy with this purchase and will try other colors in this blush.",2
"This blush is absolutely THE BEST and I will never turn back... I am VERY fair complected.... and I do make up for other people.. different skin tones, etc.. and EVERYTIME, this blush looks like perfection! WAY TO GO NARS!!!!!!!!!!",1
"This blush is amazing! I have the Deep Throat and the color goes really well with my fair/light skin. This blush is very natural looking. It may seem a little pricey, but trust me, it is worth it because it lasts a very long time!",0
This blush is amazing on my skin! It's just the perfect tone for my skin colour without too much shimmer. I used to not like blush but it's the perfect subtle tone. I apply just a bit of blush to my skin and I get that nice natural pinky glow,0
"This blush is extremely pigmented. It is very easy to blend and the color is simply divine. Texture is smooth and a little goes a long way. The rosy color of this blush gives you a natural pink flush. Be careful though, use a very light hand or your blush will be too overpowering.",0
"This blush is long lasting, highly pigmented so you only need a little. THe outlaw color is a deep rose color with tiny, tiny gold flecks in it. I use BE foundation in Medium and this color looks great on me. I give it 5 stars because this will last me forever!",1
This blush is so beautiful. Through out the whole night people were asking where did I buy my blush and what brand was it. They told me the blush highlighted my cheeks so well and really brought out my eyes. I'm in love. ,0
This blush is so pretty. I am very fair and have always had a tough time finding a blush that looked natural and that I wanted to buy again. I have purchased this blush for two years now and it is very flattering. Even on days that I dont want to wear much makeup a touch of it gives your face a lift and makes you glow. The only thing I would change is the packaging. The matte black gets dirty quickly and looks bad pretty quickly.,2
"This blush is the best I've ever used! The color is exactly the same as the flush I get by pinching my cheeks. Unfortunately that flush only shows when I do pinch them; so Benetint makes me look much better than I Inaturally do. I used to wear several different colors of blush, but not any more. I'm in love with Benetint and carry it with me everywhere! It makes a nice lip stain too.",4
"This blush is truly a cosmetic genius...the shade compliments every skin tone. Plus, it goes on so sheer and light, it doesn't sit on top of your skin, it becomes a natural part of it. You have to try it~",1
"This blush is very light and baby soft. Perfect for people who wear light makeup. I add a bit of bronzer to my cheeks when going out, but overall im hooked. Makes your cheeks look soft and young. I love it!",0
"This blush should be so much more expensive for what it does. But hey, if they wanna sell it for 10$ thanks! :) I have this in apricot and have been using it for a year, and it doesn't seem like I've used that much at all. It's definitely long-wear and beautifully pigmented. For a longer-lasting effect I like to layer it over my Smashbox O-Glow. For 10$, seriously, just go buy one and try it out yourself. You won't regret it! ",0
"This body butter is amazing! It literally melts on your skin, leaving it soft and dewy. I use it all over and it's really improved the texture of my skin. Let it soak in for a bit before dressing because it is very rich. This will be especially nice for the winter months when the skin is more prone to dryness. I've tried peach, nectarine blossom, and lime blossom so far. I've liked them all. If you don't like scented creams, this might not be for you. ",1
This body butter is divine it moisturizes and stays with your skin for a long time and the scent is divine! I like the way it goes on and feels! Vanilla cupcake is a wonderful creation I initially got it as a sample as a birthday present and I really enjoyed it! Thanks Sephora! ,2
This body butter is OK for the price. I got the tropical jasmine and thought the scent would be more floral but it just has a kinda off coconut smell. It moisturizes but it isn't as rich as other brands I've used. I wont buy it again. ,3
This body butter is very creamy and has a wonderful scent. I think it is a tiny bit oily and therefore the moisturizing effect does not last long. Sometimes my hands feel dry again 5 minutes after I put it on. ,0
"This body lotion smells wonderful. I haven't noticed a firming aspect of it however. But the scent is so amazing that it makes up for it. Its a light scent, not overpowering. It works well for day or evening. There is also a generous amount in the bottle. I have found it lasts quite a while.",2
"This body moisturizes has a light scent that is just lovely, I can't stand scents that are too strong, but the scent of moisturizer is perfect.\nand it moisturizes your skin really well too without any stickiness.\nCan't say that any part of my body got toned or firmed after using this.\nBut if you don't care that much about toning, you're going to love this.",0
This body mouse is divine! Guys will wonder what you are wearing and want to be closer to you especially if they love coffee themselves! It is not a heavy coffee smell but it does smell like a good coffee and cream! I like it and wear it a lot!! ,2
"This body wash is amazing. If you check out my review for the body lotion, you'll hear my raves on how moisturizing both products are. They are also great for some skin conditions. My skin was terrible before these products. Anywho, here I'm going to leave a tip about this product: it is FREAKING awesome to shave with. This product has ingredients in it that inhibit hair growth, plus the willow bark extract is great for sensitivity and redness associated with shaving. It's sulfate free, so none of that tight, dry feeling other lathering soaps leave. It's also great on legs and armpits that get waxed, because of the hair inhibitors, your wax lasts that much longer! And no ingrowns! Try it! ",0
"This body wash smells amazing! It gives you lots of lather and works great in a bubble bath. The fragrance is light and doesn't compete with other products. I'm not sure if I'd like it in my hair, but as a body wash it's great!",1
"This body wash smells simply heavenly. It almost makes the shower feel warmer with the cinnamon and spices. I have used it as shampoo too, and it works quite well, though I know I couldn't use it as a daily shampoo because after a couple uses it dries my hair out a bit. My 16 year old brother has used it, as has my 34 year old (male) cousin. They both love it, so it's definitely good for guys and girls! ",1
"This book is probably good for novices but I found it to be just okay. Sephora could provide how-to index cards at displays throughout the store instead of a book that tends to ""advertise"" products under the guise of being helpful ",3
"This box is super cute and would make a great gift. It is packed full of UD's most popular colors and eight exclusive NEW shades only in this box! The colors are all super pretty, plus they give you two brushes and a small primer. I love mixing and matching the colors and just playing with colors I'd not normally wear. This box is a winner! ",1
"This bronzer is amazing, I love it! It matches both my complexion and my roommates (we are very different). It has just the right touch of shimmer to add a glow, but I don't feel too sparkley. I recommend this to anyone!",0
This bronzer is great. The color goes on to instantly make you look healthy and well rested but the one drawback for some people may be the sparkles. they are definitely noticeable and may not be for everyone. ,0
"This bronzing powder gives you that natural healthy, summers glow. Once applied it looks as if you've just spent a healthy day in the sun...without the damaging affects of the suns rays! Great Product! ",0
"This brow gel is great. Face it, brow gels, for the most part, aren't that much different; they tame brows. But Anastasia's is just perfect because it delivers. It hold brows in place with a nice, glossy finish, it doesn't run or flake, and it really stays put - even through some minor rain or a short swim - until you (easily) wash it off. Since I can't live without my eyebrow pencil (Anastasia's in Brunet is great one also), I love love love that this gel keeps my pencil in place as well.",2
"This brow pencil is like no other-- unlike powders, you can get the precision you want and just the right opaqueness. Other brow fillers can be too dark, but if you've got dark brown hair like I do, this pencil is perfect!",1
This brow powder duo comes in very natural colors and the pressed-powder makes it very easy to apply. I have tried the loose-powder brow color from Bare Minerals and prefer this pressed-powder form offered by Anastasia.,1
"This brush feels a little hard (understandable since it's used for mineral makeup), and it is just too big for my taste. I can barely swirl it in any bare essentials jar, so I had to use my anna sui powder jar to swirl the brush in.",0
"This brush is a must have if you use brow powder. The grooming spooley is perfect for brushing brows into shape, even unruly hairs that always seem to pop out of line are tamed with this tool. The angled brush is perfect for making sharp brow lines if that is the look your prefer.",3
"This brush is a must have to anyone who uses make-up. It is fluffy,applies powders of all kinds and does it lightly and is soft to the touch on facial skin. This is my 4th addition to my brush collection. It washes up excellent and comes out just as good as brand new. ",4
"This brush is designed for perfect product of blush, highlighter or even powder on cheekbones. It is pricey but a good investment as if you shampoo gently and rinse to dry will last a long time. Mine is almost a year old and like new. I even use to blend eyeshadows after applying for a smooth finish. ",4
"This brush is easy to use but it's a little rough on the eyes. Even though the bristles are supposed to be straight and not frayed, it irritates my eyelids sometimes when I'm not careful. I use this brush with my Bare Escentuals powder eyeliner and it works just fine, though! The good thing about it not fraying or getting messed up easily is that it lasts a very long time without any major problems. ",0
"This brush is great even if you don't use Bare Escentuals. I use it to blend anything or buff on translucent powder. It can be rough at first, just give it a wash in shampoo and let it air dry. It also starts to feel stiff when it gets dirty. Wash it once a week if you use it every day.",1
"This brush is great for defining the crease of your eyes. It allows the color to glide to just where you put it. I own much more expensive brushes and this one ranks at the top of all of them. Also, I wash this brush really often and it has held up very well...looks and works like brand new. ",3
This brush is incredibly soft and gives a light dusting of powder. I don't like heavy coverage. I have used the bare escentuals brush for years and still like it very much too. I like that it is synthetic. ,3
"This brush is larger that what I expected, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. but it picks up the right amount of color like all the sephora professionel brushes and is of excellent quality. Just be careful on first try - it does cover the whole lid very quickly, which may take some getting used to. ",1
"This brush is my favorite brush to apply the BE foundation to my face with. As, I am able to get medium-to full coverage with this brush. And, I have not had any problems with this brush shedding badly at all!",1
"This brush is nice for applying anything loosely on your face--blush/cheek color, mineral veil, or even some light foundation. If you're looking for fuller coverage, I'd recommend a kabuki brush.\n\nI also recommend you buy a brush cleaner to clean and condition the bristles, because it'll get matted as you use it over time.",1
"This brush is perfect for applying things that you want light coverage of - mineral veil, warmth or other bronzers, blushes, etc. If I use it with foundation however, I feel like I can't even see a difference. Your better off with a buki for the foundation. It can't be beat for a looser brush though!",0
This brush is very high quality. It applies the brow color precisely where I want it. It holds and releases the color perfectly. It also holds its bristles so I don't have them falling out on my face. ,4
"This brush is wonderful for contouring under the cheekbone or for applying blush to the cheekbone. It's really soft, perfectly shaped, and picks up just the right amount of color. You can very easily build up color as you would like. Also, since the bristles are synthetic, they do not absorb color like natural bristles. I would recommend the Sephora brand brush cleaner. ",1
"This brush sounded like a good idea at first but wasn't what I thought it was going to be. It was very difficult scooping my bare minerals powder with the tiny scoop that comes with the brush to fill the bottle. You must have alot of patience to work with this brush. When it came time to actually use it, it distributes the contents very slowly and took a long time to get the coverage I wanted. To be honest, I don't use this brush very often. It is much faster for me to just open my bare minerals jar and use a brush for touch ups than using this brush. ",0
this brush to me gave the foundation a heavier coverage. the brush is decent but must be kept clean. it seemed to perform better after it was cleaned. sometimes loses hairs and can get stuck on your face or in your eyes. ,2
"This brush was such a great buy. It was inexpensive, but high quality. The bristles don't fall out or fan out, and it's great for applying creme eyeliner or using eyeshadow as a liner (my personal favorite). Easy to clean, too. It hasn't gotten stained, even with black shadow! ",0
"This buffing wash smells great just like all the Amazing Grace products. The clean scent balances the light floral scent in a great way. The cream is thick but gentle. Using this buffing wash feels better than using the grainy scrubs, but it works just as well. It is also very moisturizing. It doesn't lather as much as the body washes, but it probably isn't supposed to. ",1
"This cheek stain is by far the MOST natural looking thing that I have ever used as a blush. It makes you look like you just have a healthy, sweet glow. Not like you are wearing ""blush"", but just healthy. ",3
"This Clarisonic Skin care brush is fabulous! In the first week I saw a dramatic decrease in the size of my pores. My skin glows now like it did when I was a child. If I was going away and could only take one beauty product with me...it would be my Clarisonic! Pricey yes, but worth every penny. If you want dramatic results, this is for you! ",3
"This cleanser is amazing. Its simple. It smells good. It feels good. Its life changing. End of story.\n\nI've never found a cleanser that completely removed my makeup, moisturized my skin and left it feeling healthy and happy. I've been using it for three weeks now in combination with Hope in a Jar and the Help Me treatment, and I've never been so pleased and blown away by how radiant and healthy my skin looks.",0
This cleanser is dynamite! A pea size drop in the palm of your hand covers your entire face and pulls the dirt out NOW. I gently sweep it across my lashes with my fingers and wipe it off with a cloth - it pulls even waterproof masacara off in a heartbeat. What a wonderful cleanser! It pulls the dirt and makeup without pulling your skin's essentials. Do try . . .,3
"This cleanser is fantastic! After trying MANY of the more intensive, ""fancy"" facial cleansers out there (from Proactiv to Murad), I found that Purity Made Simple does the trick! It's not irritating to sensitive skin, but it's still effective in washing away makeup at the end of the day and keeping breakouts to a minimum. I'd recommend it any day!",0
"This cleanser is great. I've been using it for a while and I have a tendency to switch cleansers quite frequently, but I've stuck with this one for a bit. I really like it. I didn't notice that it exfoliated, but I love how it leaves my face clean and soft. It really does a great job of helping with breakouts too. I think it's got just enough salicylic... it did not dry me out. So I would definitely recommend this one. ",1
This cleanser removes all make up. No additional make up removal necessary. It feels great on and I love how good it cleans. It leaves your skin feeling soft and not dry at all. It's super gentle on the skin\n\nI even use it to clean my make up brushes. It does wonders.,1
this cleanser removes all my makeup. It doesn't leave a filim and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Since using this product (I am on month 3) its texture has improved so much. It is smoother and clearer. I think this is a fantastic product - a little bit goes a long way.,3
"This color does great things for my skin tone. I love the creamy long lasting formula too. It is very natural, but gives just the right color to light up your face. It also goes with many other colors for your eyes. I really like this and would use it as my signature color ",3
"This color is a beautiful peachy pink blush with just enough shimmer. The best thing about this color is that it's so universal, anyone can wear it and it will look so beautiful. I also have Desire which appears to be a shocking pink but when it is applied to olive skin, it will be a nice cotton candy pink, love it!",1
"This color is perfect with the Nars sparlkling blush and loose powder. Wear it alone or over another color. Very creamy and stays on for a long time. Lips really stand out with this color....very seductive, yet understated.",3
"This color wasn't anything spectacular in my opinion. I had an allergy to this color also. Usually, Lorac is awesome and my eyes aren't sensitive to their products.. The color looked richer on the website than it was. ",3
This combo is one of my favorites. The bronzer has just enough color and shimmer to give you glow without looking like you are trying to fake a tan. The blush is neutral enough that it compliments all skin tones. It also lasts a full day and doesn't do the fade away by mid-afternoon. One compact will last over 6 months of every day use.,4
"this compact is perfect for the smokey eye look. Make it as subtle or intense as you like with buildable color and a perfect pallette of colors. the texure of Givenchy powder can't be beat. It's pricey ,but worth every penny. ",4
"This ""compact"" is very handy when traveling. Just be sure to close the cover before you close the lid over the powder. It's great to have your brush and powder altogether and not have to hunt for them. It's a good product to carry in your purse, if you carry a large bag. ",4
"This concealer covers dark circles. I must say that it is rather thick and if you're not quick, it may take a while for blending. With undereye cream underneath it, it does make it easier. It's also good for other areas on the face. I only use it as a ""spot"" concealer and not for very large areas on the face.\n\nI highly recommend this product.",2
"This concealer covers well, but is a little hard to blend. Also, I always end up applying it with a concealer brush instead of my finger or directly from the stick, so the stick form isn't as convenient. On the plus, it does not irritate blemishes and it sets well with powder. I would not buy this again. ",1
This concealer is THE MOST AMAZING concealer ever. You have to use very little of it and it will cover EVERYTHING. A tip though. . .you need 2 warm it up before you use it it goes on better that way. Just blend with ur finger when its in the pot then when its soft and creamy. . .start applying. ,0
"This conditioner brings life to even bleached and battered hair. It's amazing and lightweight. Leaves no crummy residue like cheap conditioners. Reduces static and frizziness with textured hair. I have real human hair extensions, and this helps me get the most out of them. In fact, it extended my usual extension life from 8 months to 12+ months. it's gentle enough for me to use everyday. ",1
"This conditioner does make your hair very soft. However, my hair is very weak from straightening it, etc,and very dry from winter air and I've only noticed a small difference after using it for almost 3 weeks. My hair is definitely softer, not so brittle, but my hair still breaks easily. I absolutely love the smell, but I did not see ""amazing"" results. ",2
"This conditioner is definitely a light-weight conditioner, but more like a detangler. Great for people with fine hair that need to get the knots out but can't handle all the hydration of a normal conditioner. Also great for hair types that prefer to get their hydration from styling products: a nice alternative for super course hair that can't use a regular conditioner because it might take too long to rinse out. ",0
This conditioner makes your hair feel so full of moisture after you leave the shower. By the time you get to blow drying your hair is so manageable and soft it is easy to style. I have also tried the shampoo which is great too! ,4
This cream does everything it claims! Goes on silky and isn't greasy and doesn't leave your face shiny afterwards. Makes your face look great and gradually improves your skin's condition over time. The ONLY downside is the price. It would be nice if the price were lower so EVERYONE could afford to look GORGEOUS! ,1
"This cream feels so good and goes so far. I use it every night and don't tap it all the way in, but let it finish by soaking in. I have been using it about three weeks now and am very happy with it. Even if I don't use anything in the am my eyes feel hydrated and look nice from what was applied the night before. ",2
"This cream has been one of my better finds ever! I use it as a moisturizer and I've never had a cream with the wonderful results this one has had on my skin. My skin's tone has evened out. My skin feels good and it glows. I don't need foundation - just a little powder. The cream is light. It does have a chocolate fragrance which goes away, it's light, greaseless and absorbs right away. I love this product and will keep buying this. It's good for me. ",4
"This cream is great for everything from rough cuticles, to dry patches on face, elbows, legs, I think it smells wonderful, it has a camphor smell which is smoothing, I will never be without this product. ",4
"This cream is very luxurious, and smells kind of nutty and a bit like chocolate. I really liked it. I'm out of it now (I had a tube that was part of an Ojon gift set), and used to use it as hand cream before bed to wake up with really soft skin. I'd consider repurchasing, but the price is a bit of a deterrent... ",0
"This cream leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, and has a slight tightening effect also. Too bad it's so strongly fragranced.... rose and cucumber/vinegar. It's so pervasive and long-lasting that I can't apply the cream before going to work, so I'm using it on weekends and at night. If it weren't for the fragrance, I'd be a fan. ",4
This cream was very rich and moisturiizing for my dry skin. It absorbed well. I would recommend it highly for really dry skin in the winter. I just wish that it had some more anti aging .active ingredients.,4
"This creamy foaming soy cleanser is so gentle and effective. It has a very pleasant smell, and very nice lather that gently cleanse your skin, and remove all makeup. After you rinse it off with water, your face feels really refreshed, and supple. I love the 1.7 oz size for traveling or just keep it in my purse because I only need to bring one cleanser that has a built in make up remover and toner. When you travel a lot this all in one cleanser is definitely a space saver. ",1
"This curler gives me great results some days, and not so great results on other days. I really don't see the hype, and yes, I do know how to use an eyelash curler. I've been using this for over a year, and I am sure I will switch brands one of these days. ",0
"this define's skin cleansing @ it's most simple and perfect base. you should begin & end each day with this indespensible product. i use it everyday with amazing results! they should call it skin ""perfection"" made simple...because that's what it is, simply perfect<3",1
"This delivers an intense purple color to my lashes that really brings out my brown eyes. It lasts all day and doesnt smudge, the only reason I took a star off is because it clumps my lashes together in a bad way. Instead of applying it like a regular mascara I use just the tip on individual lashes to prevent clumping. ",1
"This does add volume, lenght & for me was definitly waterproof. Even cleanser & the shower would not take it off, these are the good things.......... Now the bad, it was clumpy opening the new tube, flakes everywhere so you end up with black specks all over your cheeks & the brush is way to large for the average person. Smaller, less dense brush would be alot better on this one. If you can get it on your shorter inner & outer lashes, the brush smears it everywhere, will not purchase this one again. ",3
"This does everything it claims to. It minimizes pores on nose and chin and gives a velvety finish. The only problem I find is that occaisionallly it transfers on to my cell phone. I use either this or The Present, and sometimes both together. ",4
"This dry shampoo is a lifesaver! My long blonde hair (straight, lots of it, but very fine) gets greasy at the roots the day after I wash it, and this is the perfect solution. All I do is apply it like I'm coloring my hair around the front and crown of my head, and then vigorously massage my scalp until it's absorbed. It gives my hair volume, and absorbs all the excess oil, making me able to stretch out my washing for another day! ",1
"This duo is a favorite of mine. One color is a metallic mint green, and the other is a shimmering charcoal plum. I use the plum as an eyeliner too. You can also mix them to create another color. The colors are beautiful. I wear it almost every day. ",4
"This elixir is perfect as part of your morning regime!\nI love what it does for my older skin ! It is the best thing I have ever purchased for my skin! It is good for any skin type, any age bracket! Perfect!",3
This eye cream is great for daytime use. It absorbs into the area fast so applying makeup right away is no problem. Your makeup just glides on. It's not greasy at all! And it lasts a long time because you don't have to use much at all. ,3
This eye cream is the best. It goes on so easily and feels so good. I've been using this cream for many years and I believe it works. Most people are surprized when I tell them how old I am - my skin looks much younger.,4
"this eye creme is full of great ingredients. I love Boscia, so I was excited to try this new eye treatment. it IS very moisturizing, but did not absorb. I will have to keep looking for the 'perfect' eye creme- if one exists. ",2
"This eyelash curler was recommended to me by my nail tech. I have been curling my eyelashes for years, but the older I get the harder it is to do without pinching myself, and then it takes forever to curl. No pinching with the shu uemura, and it curls really fast. ",4
"This eyeliner is fantastic. It goes on smoothly, no tugging and comes in subtle and bright colors. Plus it stays on forever. I have never had to reapply this eyeliner during the day or evening. Its the best.",2
"This eyeliner is good but you have to be very careful when applying it. It's really creamy and a littile difficult to ""smudge"". However, when you get it just right and set it with shadow or powder without trying to blend it, it's great. ",3
This eyeliner is perfect. It stays put for a long time and is easily blendable or you can choose to not smudge it and it still looks great. It doesn't go into my tear ducts or smudge under my eyes and the color is really rich. It used to be 16 dollars. ,0
"This eyeliner is pretty good. It is long wearing and a good hue (I chose black and it is very deep). It's a good-sized pencil, so it lasts a while. My only criticism is that when you sharpen it, the liner often breaks off in the sharpener and it's hard to get a good point on it. ",3
This eyeliner is super smooth. It goes on so evenly.I like to use it when I use a creamy eye shadow or a shimmery shadow. It does last longer than most eye liners. But for every day I use another brand liner that is a make up that lasts forever*. = ),0
"This eyeliner is the best of both worlds! Very easy to apply, is very soft but deposits very true color that STAYS! I think it is the best eyeliner I have every used, also great to deposit all over color as shadow ",3
This eyeliner is very cost effective as well as good quality. The sparkle is not overpowering ( I got it in Black with silver glitter) but just the right amount of silver sparkle. I have dark brown eyes and somehow when I put this on it makes my the color of my iris pop out with a more vibrant tone of brown! I love it! ,1
"This eyeshadow is really crease resistant! I've used countless other cream eye shadows that claim to be crease resistant, but none of them actually are, except for this one! The color looks really nice on your eyes since it gives off a soft and natural shimmer, so it will brighten up your eyes without the night club look. It also blends well with other eye shadows. ",0
"This ""Falling in Love"" collection is a beautiful scent, which is a bit heavier then the others. The soaps are luxurious!! I hardly need a moisurizer over the bath soaps. This is a set that I recommend for someone who enjoys a really beautiful scent along with felling very moisturized and pampered. The layering lasts a long time. ",3
"This fdt is good, but I cant' spray it on w/o spraying it all over the bathroom, as another poster said. And the poster who advised to wear a shower cap is also right. I wore a wide hair band, but it still got on my hair. I do like the product itself, though. I spray it into a small container and use a fdt brush. I get much better coverage that way.",4
"This feels cool and also works just as well as the original veil. It seems to only work with the brush that comes in the set, though. I wish it worked with my favorite BE mineral veil brush that I got in another kit. But still enjoy it. ",2
"This felt-tipped pen filled with white nail polish makes giving yourself (or someone else) a French manicure quick and easy. Best of all, it's spillproof so you can tuck it into your purse or your luggage. If you're a bit of a klutz when applying nail polish with your non-dominant hand (as I am), just use a felt-tipped polish remover pen to clean up any stray white polish in a jiffy! ",3
This file is a must have for every lady's handbag. I love the case - keeps the file clean and the grit from scratching any of the other items in my bag. Good coarse and smooth grit for filing. It's cute too! After receiving mine I ordered two more to give as gifts (pink polka-dots)! ,2
THIS formula is amazing it defenatly curls and plumps! The brush is HUGE and Magnifacent! cover all lashed in just 2 strokes. I beleive in glam-eyelashes so just one coat does not do. I would recomend at least 2 coats for supper fab look! But if your planning on crying or might .. i wouldn't wear it cuz it runs pretty easily. Using primer from este lauder helps set the maskara and prevents it from running. ,0
"This foundation glides on, blends perfectly into skin, lasts all day and does a fair job with keeping oil at bay. However, if you have acne or acne scars, I wouldn't recommend this foundation. The coverage is VERY sheer. ",1
"This foundation goes on beautifully and gives flawless coverage. It goes on lightweight, but it really covers well. I use this with a little Get Even Powder over it and voile...beautiful skin. I have large pores & uneven skin tone and this really helps to make me look my best. ",3
"This foundation is amazing! It looks perfectly natural but makes my skin look dewy and flawless. My very sensitive skin does not break out at all when I use this foundation, even if I forget to wash my face at night. ",0
This foundation is excellent. It goes on Matt and stays shine free. I generally can go all day without having to touch up any shine. It has great coverage and I don't even need a concealer and my skin looks like porcelain. I've been using powder mineral foundation for years and I've switched and I'm not going back. ,2
This foundation is so easy to use and gives a natural look yet you can achieve full coverage with it without looking cakey..........I have tried YSL's brush on foundation and it doesn't compare. I sent it back and re-orderd this one. It is also the first foudnation I have found that actually covers surgery scars on my neck without making them stand out more. It's really a wonderful product that I never want to be without. ,4
This foundation stick is heavy and somewhat greasy to begin with and does not work well on oily skin. The already greasy base makes skin shiny and the heavyness of the finish slides off of oily skin throughout the day. ,1
"This fragance is absolutely delicious! I bought it initially because I was attracted by the name. It was a pleasant surprise!\n\nThe fragance is very sweet and delicate, cotton candy is what it most reminds me off. I get constant compliments on it, and the delicious scent does not fade away as with most perfumes.\n\nThe body lotion is also delicious.",0
"This fragrance is absolutely delicious! I've been looking for that ""just right"" citrus scent for the past couple of summers, and this one was IT! It's like a blend of lemonade and orangeade with a hint of the jasmine and peach. I could smell it all day! I wish the scent lasted a little bit longer, but it does last longer than other citrus scents I've tried. I'm so glad I took a chance on this fragrance!",3
"this fragrance is not for those who like soft fragrances. it is however good for those who like fragrances which last all day long. if you like florals, you will most likely love this fragrance. plus the bottle is funky and very gwen stefani-esque ",0
"This fragrance is so unusual and distinctive, it has become known among my friends and colleagues (especially males) as ""my"" scent. Several of them have told me that they've been somewhere and thought I was sneaking up on them because someone else ""smelled like me."" It's that memorable. Based upon the reviews I've read, it sounds like other fans have had similar experiences. It also endures a night of partying- I've woken up after being in a smoky nightclub the night before, still smelling a pleasant hint of this fragrance!",2
this fragrance is to die for. once smell and you're filled with the aroma of beauty and its sp gentle. my fiance loves this scent and perfers it over my Chanel! well im sticking with the Chanel but i save this for when we go out or cuddle. i recommend this highly.,0
"This fragrance is very nice. It is just a little on the strong side, which is why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5. However, it is a beautiful fragrance as long as you don't apply too much. Very romantic fragrance and makes a great gift.",1
This gel does what it is intended to do. It keeps brows in place without becoming stiff or flaky. I use it everyday to set my brow shape in place. It also works well for those unruly hairs or sections of your eyebrow. A must have.,1
"This gives my fine hair a lift at the end of the workday when it's gotten oily, flat, and tired-looking. I put a little in my hands, flip my head upside down, and then rub it into the roots (works great on bangs, too). It absorbs oil AND it gives your hair texture and lift at the root. Or AFTER a night out, use it to get rid of the smoky bar smell that your hair holds onto. Use sparingly... it can make your hair a little sticky and too texturized if you're not careful. ",1
"This glitter gel is such a miraculous invention. For those of you who love glitter (who doesn't!!??), this gell formula gets you amazing looking glitter effeccts without the mess. And this product is very versatile, layer a little or a lot. My boyfriend even likes it too because he no longer has little flecks of lgitter in his face that rubbed off! ",1
This gloss has alot of shine and feels great on... moisturizes and is not sticky... I sometimes wear it alone but usually over a lipstick to add shine... great variety of colors and I have quite a few of them. ,3
"This gloss has great shine and it tastes good! Lots of lip gloss tastes yucky, but this one is fruity...but not overpowering. Staying power is just okay, thus the 4 Star rating. But overall, I will buy it again.",4
"This gloss is super-shiny and feels good and moisturizing on my lips without being goopy or sticky, but I didn't notice any plumping benefits, thus I'm giving this a four star rating instead of a five. ",2
"This gorgeous purple trio was everything I wanted LM Wild Violet quad to be- pigmented, shimmery, & long lasting. The colors are beautiful;They compliment ea other perfectly & really make my brown eyes pop. And like all Lorac e/s, they go on silky smooth, blend easily, & stay on 12+hrs. ",0
This hair dryer is well worth it..... it drives my hair very quickly without burning it. My hair is left very shiny and soft but the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the static that is left in my hair. I put glossing spray to get rid of the static but that may not work for everyone... ,0
"This hair product does add luster and shine to your hair. I loved the ingredients, which should be nourishing, thus I purchased it.The fragrance, however, is very stong, overpowering and so unpleasant that I doubt I'll ever purchase it again. ",4
This hair styler is wonderful! It heats up super fast and curls or straightens instantly. The insulated case is great for travel. If I have any negative comment it would just be the price. $300 is A LOT to pay. ,2
"this has a very pretty and soft color. gives a beautiful glow to the skin, especially if you already have a base tan. easy to apply and fix any ""errors""!! the only problem is that the powder is very soft in the case and almost turns to a loose powder so it can be a mess. i would definitely buy again. ",2
"This has become my very favorite facial moisturizer. It feels so light, but moisturizes like a much heavier cream. My mature skin just drinks it in, and although my skin is very sensitive, it causes no breakouts or problems- I love it! ",3
"this has got to be the best makeup i've ever used it last all day looks great at the end of the day, doesn't breask out my face and if i happen to fall asleep wearing it it wont hurt my skin....its soooo goood ",3
"This has helped my make-up last all day. Reapplying throughout the day helps it last. I even use this after I wash my face at night before bed (and of course before putting my makeup on). I've noticed that it's helping my complexion, too",0
"This has seemed to lighten up my dark circles. But when I use it in the daytime it feels a little too thick and greasy. I only use it at night now, and use an eye cream that absorbs into my skin more thoroughly during the day. ",2
This has such a great color to it and I often shake the brush to get the excess powder off so that it comes off on my cheeks as a more natural and lighter color. I use it as a blush and I think the color is terrific. ,0
"This has to be one of my absolute fav lip glosses (and I am a lip gloss addict). Sienna 06 is the perfect color on me and I get loads of compliments when I wear it. As an african american woman sometimes i find it difficult to find colors I like, but this is a must have for me and I keep a tube at all times. I love the color selection and feel of what I consider to be Sephora's best gloss yet, and I think it smells great. My only complaint would be that I'm continuously running out of this before any of my other glosses run out. I feel like the tube goes empty too fast, like it looks like it holds more than there actually is. ",0
This has to be the best blush in the world! The color Org-asm is my favorite. It give me a sunkissed look when applied with a bronzer. For a more dramatic effect I wear the bronzer just on my cheeks and top it with the color. It is amazing!,1
"This has to be the best product ever invented for hair! I'm addicted to this stuff and when I'm starting to run out, I have to make sure I buy another large tube so that I don't have to go without. It's excellent for smoothing the hair, I find. Leaves it silky and soft and much more manageable. I cannot go without this product. ",1
"This hides large pores like nothing I've ever tried! I use it as an all over face primer because it hides pores, hides fine lines and makes my skin so smooth and flawless. I buy two at a time because I'm paranoid they'll stop making this perfect product! ",2
"This hot cocoa is the yummiest chocolate scent. It smells exactly like a cup of hot cocoa made from scratch. The scent lasts on me well after I have showered. Besides the great scent, Philosophy shower gels have been my favorite of all I've tried. They lather very well, and a little always goes a long way. ",1
"This iron heats up super hot, super fast. (You can adjust the temp, but I keep mine high.) My super thick hair, even when it was breast-length, could be straightened to salon quality in the same amount of time it would take there. If you are used to a larger iron, or a curling iron, it is awkward to use at first, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of it. You can also use this to create waves, flips, curls, etc. ",1
"This is a beautiful color, but the brush that comes with it is not what it should be. It should be soft and apply the product evenly on the lips, instead it is hard and wants to clump it all in one spot. Could've been better with the brush Smashbox. ",3
"This is a beautiful kit. What you get for the price even better. The eye colours are beautiful, Golden Ruby is like butta. The buxom is so lovely as is the RubyRadiance. The bonus is the double ended mascara, the ruby end make the most gorgous eyeliner. Just dip in your liner brush. So I say go for it girls, you won't be disapointed. ",2
"This is about the size of my hand, from fingertips to my wrist. It's small, but really cute. The colour is nice, and the lining inside is bright lime green. I just keep lipgloss in mine, but you could put money or change in it. It would be a nice change purse to keep inside of a larger purse. ",0
"This is a complete waste. you cannot apply it dry as it just falls all over your face, really messy. i used a high quality brow powder brush and am experienced with cosmetic application. wet it works slightly but looks unnatural, no control and no staying power. a waste of time and $$(altho i am returning it) ",3
"this is a cool idea, however, it does need to be tweaked. if you use it with the brush, its hard to get the cap back on and a lot of product just floats out into the air. i twisted the bottmo cap off and poured the product into one of my empty bare mineral jars. that way, i am not wasting product. i like the ease and convenience of it.

"This is advertised for chronically stressed skin... I have sensitive dry skin and this lotion irritated it a lot. It had menthol in it, so as soon as you put it on, your face is on fire! If anything it is meant for anything BUT stressed skin! Plus senstive skin a lot of times tends to be on a dryer side and this lotion has no moisturizing properties whatsoever. What a waste! ",1
"This is a fabulous blush. One particular shade which the review won't let me type, starts with an OR and ends with SM iis very flattering in peachy pink with gold undertones. Deep Throat, also peachy pink and pearlescent is also great. I cannot vouch for other colors, some of which go on differently (which I have tried and did not like as much).",3
"THIS IS A FABULOUS SET! FROM THE BRUSHES TO THE RUBY BLUSH, RUBY LIPS, I HAVE BEEN GETTING SO MANY COMPLIMENTS !!! I'M IN MY MID FIFTIES AND THIS MAKES ME FEEL WONDERFUL AND HAS ME LOOKING FABULOUS!! THE MASCARA I USED ON A SPECIAL DATE W/ MY HUBBY = ) I HOPE THEY COME OUT WITH A SAPPHIRE SET hmmmmmm........... ",4
"This is a fairly deep red for me since I usually stick with mid-tone colors. However, I like the lipstick and it wears very well. It is a little dry, but considering I am 71, that is not unusual. I sometimes use a lip balm or gloss before applying it or another NARS lipstick in a satin finish such as DOLCE VITA.",4
"This is a fantastic value and I love almost every item. The only thing I am not using is the check color--I'm a bit skeptical of items that go into the skin and change the color. But the blush, the eye shadow and the eye liners all are fabuous colors and it is a really great deal. ",4
"This is a favorite of mine. I have curly hair that needs help after sleeping - I just spray this wornderful mist and my curls bounce right back. It gives hair shine, it conditions it and it smells good ",4
This is a fine new variation of an old favorite. The first O blush tended to dry out after a month or so. There was plenty left but it was difficult to get it on the brush . The new compact is creamier and I doubt that will be a problem. The gold flakes do seem to disappear from the cheek area after a few minutes but the color stays. It is perfect for my pale colorless skin. I use it over the multiple cream stick. A fine if expensive blush. ,4
"This is a fresh, clean and different scent and I love it! The bottle is so huge it'll probably last me forever. I intend to wear it all year not just summer. Highly recommend if you like a light scent. It reminds me of a Channel perfume I used to wear years ago but they don't make it anymore, I think the name was Christelle. ",4
"This is a full and thick brush! I don't use it for my everyday application, but I love to use it for shimmer bronzing all over the body, face and even in my hair. This brush feels very soft and luxurious to me.",2
"This is a good blush but it is not one of my favorites. It contains talc which my skin is more sensitive too, and the color is extremely strong on my skin (I have fair-to-olive skin) so I can only wear it on an evening date or clubbing, it would look much too heavy for a work day. Overall though, the shimmer in the colors make for a nice effect.",0
"this is a good brush, but feels as though it needs constant cleaning. the make up feels like it gets very deep inside the brush. but still a good brush, that helps one to apply blush very quickly and covers a good area.",0
"This is a good idea on the part of BE. I was able to determine what colors I actually like (although I had predicted accurately what they would be), and discover that I do like this formulation of lipstick. It was worth the price, and this palette will last a good long time, as this is not a flimsy, soft lipstick. It has some decent staying power, a nice selection of colors, and a very usable brush. I may well be buying full sizes of a couple of these colors, if they are still available when my palette gets used up. Maybe I wont even wait that long! ",4
"This is a good moisturizer if you want to use it overnight while you sleep. As far as under your make-up, it definitely is not suitable. It has a rather sticky texture. It does give you very soft skin, and I recommend it for people who get dry flaky skin. It has a strong smell to it, and if you plan on wearing any type of foundation/concealer/powder, it is not very compatible with it.",0
"This is a good product, however I still get an oily sheen after a few hours, so it could be better. It does hydrate well, no complaints there. I'll continue to use it, it's still better than anything else I've tried. ",4
"This is a good product. I have very dry color treated hair and have to keep on top of the conditioning. I've been known to leave this in overnight and it gives such a nice softness and shine the next day after shampooing. It's the scent I do not like. I can't describe it, but if you can take a sample sniff before buying I'd advise that. ",4
"This is a gorgeous scent, very unique. The only complaint I have is the staying power. I tend to love oriental scents and this one is definitely a new favorite. I just hope it doesn't get discontinued! ",1
"This is a great blush for night time. I didn't really find it translucent, but it looked great with a tan! It's a little shimmery to wear during the day, but the color is very natural. I have medium skin and this was a good choice for the summer months for me, but now that I'm a little less tan I would go with something a little lighter. It's a very deep color.",1
"This is a great blush! I have fair skin, and it is just perfect!! It puts that needed glow into my skin and comes in a nice compact. I would have spent more money on this product if I had to. WORTH BUYING!",1
"This is a great brush, compact and separates the lashes well. Removes easily with warm water, so gentle on the lash. I like to use the blue color as a base and then tip the end lash with black. Although a little high for my usual purchase for mascara, it it well worth it.",3
"This is a great buy! I'm very happy with it, although I do wish it was a bit more creamy in texture (I have extremely dry skin) and lasts a bit longer. It's very simple and easy to apply. It takes only a few minutes and gives a natural, effortless glow. I love the brushes and the foundation primer. Those alone are worth money. All in all this is great for anyone and makes a great gift. I gave this set to my best friend after using this! ",0
This is a great clay mask - and I thought clay masks weren't even in existence anymore. This mask is worth every penny and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great detoxifying mask. You can even use a tiny dab of it on a pimple and it totally dries it up. Fantastic product!,2
"This is a great cleanser for my sensitive but breakout-prone skin. Not too drying, doesn't leave my face with that 'tight' feeling like so many others, but soft and even fewer breakouts. I've tried so many others that just didn't work for me - and cost more - sometimes much more! ",3
This is a great collection of scents. There are several floral and woody oriental scents.It is probably more appropriate for the over 30 set. I have really liked 2 of the scents so far and have not chosen a favorite yet. It is beautifully packaged also. ,2
"This is a great deal, probably the best of the CARGO collections (I have three). The blush is a beautiful pink shimmer and the lip glosses include a neutral, two pretty pinks, and a reddish/berry. The powder really does seem airbrushed... I can see why they call it ""high def."" The mascara is a comb rather than a brush, which works great. ",1
"This is a great eye cream for moisture. It is not oily, heavy or doesn't make your make-up crease. I would not say it is any anti-aging treatment, but for a daytime moisture eye cream that doubles as a primer for make-up, this is the one for you, it just glides on & absorbs very fast leaving a velvet texture. ",3
this is a great eyelash curler for people that are afraid to use them. it was easy and did not pull or tug at my lashes. I don't agree with having to replace it instead of replacing just the pads. I find that a little annoying because the curler is really doesnt have to be replace just cause the pad wears out. ,2
This is a great face wash. I see a big improvement in my acne with this product. It only takes a tiny bit. And the bottle is very large. Will last a long time. My face feels really clean when I am done. Love it!!! ,2
"This is a great facial scrub. It's my husbands favorite one. Very effective. Not fragrant. Effective. I prefer it to the clinique womens equivalent. Now we just buy this one product and we both use it. I have sensitive skin, so i just barely rub with a very light hand, no scrubbing with a heavy hand necessary.",2
"This is a great gift for those who are open to new fragrances and like to wear a new fragrance several times before deciding on it in a full-size version. The refillable atomizer is a wonderful bonus; I love to have several filled with different fragrances and ready to be popped in my purse or travel bag. Thanks, Sephora! ",4
"THis is a great idea, I agree with other reviewers, I did think it would be a little smaller. Also is refillable, found this out when a co-worker accidentally opened it & spilled it out on floor. Had to replace some right away. WOrks great and would benice if foundation could come this way also. ",2
This is a great introduction to Juice Beauty. The cleanser works well and the moisturizer is very light and dewey. Love the hydrating mist! The apple peel was okay. But the ingredients are what i was looking for in an antiaging regime. ,3
This is a great introduction to the primer. Unfortunately it doesn't last long so the larger bottle is excellent. The shadows are nice. I use the blue s a night eyeliner and the gold base is nice daily shadow. These are basics that once you buy them you will continue to replace them. ,4
"This is a great item, it's purse size for touch ups and travel sized for that pesky one quart bag of goodies we all have to shove in our carry-ons now. These are two Geller products that we just can't do with out! The eye spackle holds shadow on all day and night, keeps the color true and keeps it from creasing. The lip spackle does that same but beware if you have chapped lips!! It will show every dry spot. Make sure exfoliate then moisturize your lips first, leave moisturizer on for a few minutes, blot off and then apply the lip spackle. It is a bit drying on it's own as it is but it's worth it for the long lasting, true lip color you get when using it. ",3
This is a great kit and a good value. The colors would seem to me to work with both warm and cool toned skin colors. Love the ruby radiance and the ruby buxom and cute clutch. Not crazy about the luminous lashes as it seemed to be very dry when I applied it but the rest of the kit is 5 stars in my opinion! ,4
"This is a great kit when you want notice me eyes, and you will get notice. The brush itself is worth the price. Tip: You may want to put this on before your foundation, the powder tends to be a little messy at first, so you may have to redo your foundation otherwise ",0
"This is a great looking, well made, comfortable to carry tote that is large enough to be useful and compact enough to reside in your purse, glove box or pocket. I love mine and love that everyone asks about it. ",4
"This is a great make-up remover. I've used this for years, since I was in college. As a lifetime devotee of deep black eyeliner and mascara, I need a good eye make-up remover and this takes it all off and leaves NOTHING behind. I actually switched to this one from Efacil (not sure if Lancome makes it anymore) because it worked so much better. I will admit, the texture did take a little getting used to, as it was oilier than I was used to, but if you take your eye make-up off before you wash your face, it will rinse right off with the cleanser.",1
"This is a great mascara it barely flakes stays even through the night! The morning after i used this mascara, my boyfriend said ""wow babe you have sexy eye lashes"" i just laughed and said ive never herd that compliment before. it must make a difference if he noticed he didnt notice the last time i changed my hair color but he noticed my BAD GAL lashes!!",0
"This is a great pencil and works well for older women (I'm 56) because it goes on easily and has a soft line. Sometimes it hard to find colors that aren't harsh and I think it's important for women to tone down their makeup as they age. But, if you're young and want more drama, it's easy to increase the intensity of these liners.",4
"This is a great primer! It prevents any sort of cosmetic, powder or cream, from settling into fine lines. I use it under concealer, around my lips, anywhere that cosmetics tend to settle into. I find my eye makeup lasts longer and stays fresher when I use this too. ",3
"This is a great product as a makeup remover and skin cleanser. I am fair with combination skin and rosacea. Its really hard to find products that dont make my skin go crazy. This is a winner. It feels clean, theres no residue and it doesnt make my skin red. I use it after washing my face and even on days when I dont wear makeup and just want a refresher. ",2
"This is a great product for someone who doesn't want a glittery bronzer, but wants a little luminosity. I have oily skin and most bronzers with a lot of shimmer emphasize the problem. The colors here look natural on, not orangy but brown like a real tan, and if you want a little more color, it's buildable. ",1
"This is a great product for use on a weekend trip since it will stay on for three days! It does flake off a bit on the third day so you may need a touch up, but it is much better than other waterproof mascara products. Lashes look full and natural, not spiked and stiff and it comes off with plain water on the third day - no raccoon eyes! ",2
"This is a great product. I don't really like bronzer, but this is a great cross between a blush and bronzer that just makes me look healthy and glowing. It's a great value too. I just replaced my first one, which lasted over a year! ",2
"this is a great product if you have distressed skin. it soothes irritation and sensitivities, moisturises and calms your skin at the same time. penetrates much better than la mer. i have very sensitive skin that is partly dry but also prone to irritation and breakouts. this cream totally calms my skin and moisturises without causing breakouts. in the winter, i use it morning and night. in the summer, i find it a bit heavy, so i use a light moisturizer in the morning and use creme ancienne at night. this is a very intense cream, so you only need to apply a tiny bit. i invested in the large size - totally worth it as it lasts about 1.5 years.",1
This is a great product. I have it in Deep Throat and it gives me a healthy glow.. it also stays on for a very long time. This is definitely a must-have. It's a bit expensive but it's totally worth it!,0
"This is a great product. I have tried the Fekai line also. This will hold fine, thin, limp (fluffy wavy) hair. I used with hot rollers and also to stlye with a steam-added iron/ straightener. My hair stayed set for 5 days!! The curls got looser, but held very well for that long. It also worked to keep my hair nice and straight for 5 days also! It did not 'weigh down' my hair. It does not dry sticky and dries quickly. I think for these reasons.. its as good as the pricey stuff -for my flat ,limp hair! I like Fekai also.. ",4
This is a great product! It gives your legs a gorgeous glow and provides a great scent...espeically good to accent yourself if you're already wearing the Michael Kors perfume. Perfect for the summer especially! ,0
"This is a great product...it provides good coverage and provides a beautiful finish. It also wears all day, I work in health care and wear a mask off and on all day. My 17 year old daughter also wears this. ",3
"This is a great product I've told a hand full of people about it since i first started using it about 8 months ago. There are a few other good face mist's out there that i would recommend as well, but this is a A+ product.",0
This is a great product! I was leary due to it being a powder foundation but with a fpundation brush it works perfectly. It gives full coverage (or as little as you want) and doesnt feel like your wearing anything. I normally use bare minerals and this is just as good. You do need a little patience picking out the right color if your not lucky enough to get it right the first time. ,2
"This is a great product. Since discovering Philosophy I do not use any other face cleanser. After using, my skin feels soft and all the makeup comes off, completely.\n\nUse to use Clinique soap, which was fine, but Philosophy get the makeup off much better.",4
"This is a great red, true and sophisticated. It absolutely stays put, you can go a long time between touchups, and it doesn't smear or fade. Personally I'm not crazy about pencils because you waste a lot of product, but the color is worth it.",3
"This is a great remover, takes off even stubborn mascara and glitter eyeshadows. It makes you feel refreshed, and it won't break out sensitive skin. Try it, and you'll never go back to drugstore removers or wipes again!",1
"This is a great, rich scent. It's not too spicy; it has some fresh scents to counteract the woody, musky notes. It's my favorite male fragrance of this year, hands down. Very original, but I could see it becoming a classic.",0
"This is a great set if you love long lasting bright color. I was considering the eyeliner set similar to this one by Make Up Forever. A Sehpora sales person told me she thinks both sets are great and uses both all the time, but that the Urban Decay set is a better value because the pencils are bigger and the set is less expensive. I also thought the colors in the Urban Decay set were brighter. This product has lasted a near 20 hour day (with a few tears) with no smudging. I do find it doesn't stick so well to my inner rim though. I'm very happy with this purchase and my Sephora salesperson was really helpful. ",0
"This is a great set! It smells sweet and delicious! A small amount of the shower gel goes a long way... it is very foamy. The body cream melts into your skin. The lip gloss is clear, super shiny, and tastes great! I think it is a good deal. ",1
"THIS IS A GREAT SET! SUPER VALUE TOO. SOME OF THESE COLORS I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT OR EVEN TRIED FOR THAT MATTER, BUT SINCE THE SET IS SO CHEAP, ITS EASY TO TRY A VARIETY LIKE THIS OFFERS. I LIKE IT!! MOST OF THE COLORS ARE WEARABLE. LOVE THE COBALT LINER, LOOKS BRIGHTER IN PICTURE. YOU DO NEED TO GET THE LITTLE REFILLABLE CONTAINERS IF YOU GET THIS BECAUSE THEY JUST COME IN THE PLASTIC HOLDER SEPARATELY.. THESE DO NOT FIT IN THE REFILLABLE QUADS... ONLY THE CARDBOARD REFILL SETS, OR THE INDIVIDUAL ONES. THATS A BUMMER. ",1
"This is a great set to try the products out or to give as a gift. The lotion has macadamia nut oil near the top of the ingredients list and as a result, your skin will be softer than you've probably been since you were a toddler. The fragrance is lovely. ",4
This is a great summer fragrance. It reminds me of cotton candy & I just want to eat it! I wouldn't wear it everyday b/c it is very sweet & you might get sick of it but to wear it for date night would be something special~,1
"This is a great value for the money. I was very skeptical, but decided to give it a try. LOVE IT! I agree with one of the other reviews - try the colors in the store - what I would have picked out online was VERY different that what I decided upon in the store. ",3
"This is a high quality although ""pricey"" palette (4 stars is 4 the price) that protects your ""pricey"" shadow and blush pans. It's easy to interchange colors and great for travel. I like that ithe eye shadow and blush pans are the same size unlike a XXX brand not carried at Sephora. ",4
"This is a high quality blush ans this is why I gave 4 stars. I'm fair with pink undertones (NW15-20). This blush is very peachy on me. This does not brighten up my face at all, to yellow. I will not repurchase. ",4
"This is a light, never cakey blush. I use this over Benetint when I go out or want a more ""done"" look. It has a great sheen to it, and look so natural. It seems to look great on any skin color, although I am medium tone. I always keep a spare in my purse for touch ups. Its fabulous!",3
"This is a lip plumper that tingles, not burns. I don't know if it does much plumping, but it has a really cool, tingly minty feeling and s nice shine. It's not sticky at all and has a great texture. It has a nice gloss and a little sparkle. I'm not a big fan of sparkle but if you like it you'll like this. I bought Candi which I didn't think I'd like when I saw it online but it's a really pretty pink. Colors are pretty opaque and deep.",1
"This is all I need to take off ALL my make-up. It leaves my skin so clean and fresh. I leave it right by my sink, so even on days that I am not wearing make-up but just want to wash my face... it is handy! Not drying at all!",3
"This is a lovely and complicated floral, with more levels and not at all cloying, the way some florals can be. It's intoxicating, but perfume is such a personal choice! I wouldn't describe it as being for a ""young"" woman, rather, I would describe it for being for a confident, thoroughly female lady of any age at all. When I think ""young"" I think unformed, still developing. This is for a woman who has arrived, regardless of her age. ",3
"This is a lovely perfume. It smells fresh and sophisticated, not a combination you find everday. I do not enjoy all the fragrances that smell like sugar or food. I know this has a very intense grapefruit smell, but it has a sophisticated presence. ",3
"this is always one of my favorite fragrances, I always seem to keep coming back to it. It wears very nicely and lasts for quite sometime. It also can be layered with a lot of vanilla type of fragrances. It's fresh, soft, and sweet... perfect for everyday. I've also bought the deodorant spray which is a bit light, so not super deodorizing.... but it smells fantastic!",1
"this is AMAZING! i cant not live without it becasue it makes everything better. hydrates my skin, smells and feels refreshing, gives me a GREAT glow, can be used with and without makeup and all of my friends are now addicted to it too. i keep the big bottle at home and the little bottle in my person. perfect for any occasion and all skin types. my mom with rosacea even uses it.",0
"This is a much easier way to bring Mineral Veil along in a handbag with less mess than previous compacts. I like that it's refillable as well since I prefer the Tinted version. However, I think the packaging doesn't seem very sturdy and I'm not sure how long it will last. ",4
This is a must have item for everyones make-up collection. This shade is perfect year-around. The blush last me a year and every year without I return to Sephora to purchase my must have blush. I recommend this blush to anyone.,0
This is an adorable kit! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I don't like black licorice. This would make a great Halloween gift for anyone that likes shower gels. The carmel apple and pumpkin spice muffin are wonderful (fyi - I think the pumpkin spice muffin smells better than the old pumpkin pie formula). I'm buying extras to take out of the haunted house box and use for Christmas stocking stuffers. ,3
"This is an amazing product. I have very oily skin and this helps any shadow stay on as an eyeliner all day. No flaking, smudging, or ""racoon eyes""! It works best with the BE eyeshadows, in my opinion, but can be used with others if needed [some of my BE didn't make it back from a trip in a prompt manner]. ",3
"This is an amazing product. It goes on clean and works for 24 hrs+. With this product, you will no longer have creases in your eyeshadow. You can work out or sweat, whatever, but as long as you have an adequate application, NO CREASING! This is the only product that I am not looking to replace in my makeup bag and have continued to buy. ",0
this is an average moisturizer. its purpose in my opinion is that it works well with bare minerals foundation. i will totally agree that unless i use this moisturizer under the mineral make up i wont use any at all. ,2
This is an awsome product! I got a demo at a store and saw first hand how easy it is to apply. I get great coverage and my skin looks flawless. It covers my rosacea and gives me a porcelain look!!! I used it (ver sparingly) almost every day and it lasted about 3 months. I only wish it would last a bit longer.,2
"This is a neat product. However, when I apply it, the color of the lipstick I have on is picked up by the applicator brush. Also, because I did not keep watch, I'm not sure how long my lipstick actually stayed on, compared with another long-lasting lipstick with gloss. ",4
"This is a NEED set not a want set. I was introduced to this almost 3 yrs ago in college by one of my best friends. I should thank her for life. At first I was really skeptical, to a point where I would still wear foundation underneath the bare escentuals products. I just felt more confident since I work outdoor and people ALWAYS looks at my face. But recenly I cut down on the foundation and just used this alone. After 2 yrs I finally stand up for my skin and wanted the best for it. I just think it takes time to adjust to what it wiill do for you. It is not going to look flawless but at least it's natural and if you use the multitak mineral as concealer you will get pretty decent coverage. This package is the best deal to start with even if you just want one thing since they provide all the brushes you need. You will have to take care of them though . Otherwise I will recommend this strongly for all starters. I promise you won't get your hands off it. I dont think none of us did. Just ask for consultant for which colors to use. I think lately they just made more colors but I'm sticking with Medium Beige. :) ",0
"This is an every occasion perfume BUT BEWARE! It has awesome side effects that you'll absolutely love! LIke many compliments, sniffing and hearing ppl ask what's that smell, and feeling sexy and demure when you wear it. This is my standard night on the town perfume! Guys love it and it smells like nothing else on this earth! NO JOKE!",0
"This is an excellent hand cream. But- and this is a big but- the smell is a bit overpowering. It does smell very Christmas-y, but in more of a home-fragrance than personal fragrance kind of way. The scent would be great for a candle or air freshener, but most people will probably not want to walk around smelling like this. It lingers for quite a while too, and is so strong it would probably clash with perfume. ",2
"this is an excellent primer, but the container is horrible. After about 1/4 of the product is gone you have a very hard time getting anymore out. I had to cut the bottom off to get about the last 1/4 out (too much just to throw away). If it gets repackaged, say in an airless pump (almost anything would be better), then I could recommend this wholeheaertedly. ",3
"This is an excellent product. I am medium skin color and medium color blend perfectly. I use the roller ball, it works the concealer in those tighter areas around the eye, no tugging. The highlighter is a plus, I use it when I first put on make up and great for afternoon touch ups to look awake. I use to buy a seperate highlighter and they are not cheap, so this is a great buy to have both in one. I've said it before, love this line, I will be 45 in two months and people think I am 35! ",3
This is an excellent product. It is absorbed quickly and leaves a good base for my foundation. Using this allows me to use less foundation than I would without it. My skin is very sensitive and this has not irritated it. ,4
"This is an excellent product that I'm so glad to find available without having to go to a dermatologist every time. I use this along with the Cellex-C and phyto + serum from SkinCeuticals and can tell a huge difference in the texture and elasticity of my skin. All these products go on light and sink in within five minutes so they are easy to use even when in a hurry to get ready in the morning. Best results when used twice a day as they recommend, even though a bit pricey. They are well worth it for the results. ",3
This is an excellent skin smoother and helps with fine lines and wrinkles. It also gives you a smoother surface to apply your makeup. I also like how my skin looks after using it. I frequently don't use makeup now. ,4
"This is an excellent value, just the price of the primer and tinted moisturizer alone exceed the price of the kit and the ""full"" sizes are marginally larger than the ones included in this kit. I ordered the Nude kit and received the Sand for some reason. Okay, I could send it back but as others have stated in their reviews there are those that use Nude for winter and Sand in the summer. I am light skinned with yellow undertones. The Sand is a bit dark at the present time for me and it is more yellow-based than I like. I have decided to keep the kit and ordered the Nude tint buy itself. The product is thin enough to feather well into the jawline so that you do not have this aburpt line. I think that between the Nude and Sand I will be able to either use each sepately or blend my own custom color. Apart from the shipping faux pas, I love the products and like LM's makeup line entirely. ",4
"This is an extremely luxurious body cream...the scent is light but heavenly. My husband's best friend says he wishes I could travel with him in his car, because I always smell so great! Thanks Mr. Fekkai! Now...Mr. Fekkai would only offer the candle he offered a few years ago in the identical scent! I was SO hooked on that candle & it was only offered (that I'm aware) as a set, along with the FF La Creme Luxueuse. ",3
"This is a nice blush, but I am not sure it is the best I have ever used. I can see that it is a power on my face, and I just prefer something sheer so I guess I will have to stick to a mousse or gel stain, but it is good for a powder. I have the color O------ and is is a great color the the very apple of your cheek for that pop of color that really makes you look glowing. I use another blush, then just use this on the apple of my cheeks.",1
"This is a nice, freshly scented exfolliating wash (not girly at all, so guys could use it without smelling fruity/flowery) that adds a little sudsy action to the mix. I wouldn't call it hydrating, but it didn't dry my skin out like soap. It leaves my skin nice and smooth. I prefer to use it during the summer since my dry skin really needs something more hydrating in the winter (with this, I get out of the shower and my legs are scaly before I even get to the closet to reach my lotion). ",0
"This is a nice mild foaming cleanser that does a good job of de-greasing my skin without over-drying it. It's fragrance-free and you only need a little bit so I can see my (very reasonably-priced) bottle lasting me a long time. My only tiny gripe is that it could be better at removing eye makeup. Otherwise this is a great basic no-frills, non-irritating cleanser and definitely deserves a place on your bathroom counter!",0
"This is a nice pencil. Not 'in love' for $20. I used it for my lip lines, to try to cover the tiny redness. I am too pale for this color. I prefer the clear Givenchy brow/! pencil.. not a great comparison, considering the big claims made for this pencil But, It seems to stay on well... Maybe a pencil cant ever make a ""nearly perfect face."" But- I really wanted my lip- lines to honestly be concealed-- after reading the reviews here. I dont agree with the description: the ""ultimate pouty lips""-Nice for lip lines, not ultimate. Another catch phrase.. ",4
"This is a nice way to indulge your need for chocolate without the calories... works pretty well as a shampoo, too. Does make the water kind of brown if you are taking a bath, but who cares? Fun and yummy. For the price, it's a 5 star value. ",2
"this is an incredible lipstick. the formula is silky and the colors are heavenly. but the one I loved the most, Shiniest Meringue, is gone. it was a translucent, dreamy color, with the most glorious, soft, opalescent little sparkles and I wish I had bought a whole case! oh well- maybe I'll fall in love with another color. this lipstick has a very unique formula that is yet to be matched. it is sheer but packed with color; shiny, but long-wearing. it is a great choice for someone who wants a more lipstick-like gloss without the presence of a lipstick or the stickiness of a gloss. [it is almost like a 'grown up', older sister to a lip gloss. it's hard to describe, but that's the best I can do.] it is especially moisturizing. if you are looking for gloss with staying power in a bullet form, you must try this. it is called 'Addict' for a reason; you'll be hooked on this amazing formula in no time. maybe Dior will have pity on us 'Addict'ed ones, and re-issue our favorites. [sigh] ",2
"This is another great product by Vincent Longo. This product line is easily becoming a favorite of mine! The liners go on easy, have a lovely texture, are long wearing (and help your lipsticks and glosses to be as well!) , and the duel colors allows you to diversify (lighter for the day/darker for evening all in one stay-put stick!) ",1
This is another great product from Bare Escentuals. Not as intense as a blush can be..just soft pretty color that you can apply without worrying about overdoing it. Gives a very nice glow to your skin that compliments the other products Bare Escentuals offers.,4
"This is another winner in my book. It's so easy to use, and does a quick, but thorough job of cleaning my make-up brushes. And, it lasts a long time, as it doesn't take a lot of product to clean several brushes. ",4
"This is a perfect neutral. Not too pink, brown or berry it is the chameleon of lip glosses. No sticky texture of glops of gloss on the sponge app;icator and it lasts! It does not have a frosty finish and looks very sophisticated yet perfect for running errands. ",4
"This is a perfect powder - no color, but that's one of the reasons I like it so much. There's no chance of it not blending with your highlighter, cover up, or other makeup. It leaves a flawless finish to your skin that looks like your skin, and not a makeup.",2
This is a pretty good long-wear lip color. It goes on smooth and doesn't flake or clump like a lot of others. I am a horrible lipstick wearer but this one still has a hint of color left at the end of my day. But the biggest pro- for me is that it doesn't dry out my lips and feel gross. ,1
This is a product that I got a tester for in the retail store. The store is great -- they will take any of the big testers and fill a small one for you to take. I got home and wanted to buy it immediately. It has a sweet smell. This also happens to be a very convenient fragrance as it is a rollerball and small enough to carry in your purse. I give it 2 thumbs up! ,2
This is a really cool product. I have nice thick brows and this stuff makes them look nice and polished. It's makes you look as if you just had them waxed. It's also good if your brows are starting to grow out . It will help hold all the little hairs in place.,1
"This is a really good gift idea; it offers a great range of mascaras at an affordable price. To be honest, the small tubes last as long as the large tubes (I throw mine out after using it for 3-4 months), so this is a real bargain! However, some mascaras in there do not work as well as others, but it is still a pretty good deal. ",0
"This is a really GREAT mostuizer and I've been using it daily like a foundation. I have ""older"" skin and the weight is perfect..gives mostiure without feeling heavy, but I can see how the youth could think it was a bit heavy! I LOVE the coverage ",3
"This is a really great product if your eyeshadow shifts, creases, or fades throughout the day. I don't usually wear it daily (unless it's really hot, or humid), but if I know I'm going to be out late, or if I'm doing some dramatic makeup I use PP to make sure it stays where I put it. ",0
"This is a really great product, it actually does what it is supposed to do! I love it, but I remember it was a ilttle pricey, and was very disappointed to realize I had left it in my car and it didnt do so well in the heat. It melted all over everything in my make up bag. As much as I loved it, I have been reluctant to replace it becuase of the expensive price tag. ",0
"This is a really nice kit. I especially like the blushbooster(I use it alone) and the tinted moisturizer. The other products are okay. The eye shadows are nice. The lip Venom I'm not crazy about, and the other liquid sutff that suppose to prevent your eye shadow from creasing did not work for me. But I have issues with that anyway becaue I have oily eye areas naturally. The product that you line around your lips with to prevent feathering is nice. Overall, if you like only a few products in the kit it's still worth it. ",3
"This is a really nice non-greasy eye cream, perfect for those with oily skin. Seemed to lighten my dark circles a bit, but as far as I can tell it does nothing for puffiness or wrinkles. Did not irritate my sensitive, contact-lens-wearing eyes. ",2
"This is a really nice set where you can try more than one color for a fabulous price! There is a lot of product in each gloss, the smells are fabulous, and there is a lot of shine and color. The apricot color doesn't really have much pigment, but I use it over a stain so it looks great! This is a nice gift for anyone, but I bought this for myself. There is a wide range of colors to suit everyone and all the colors look great on my very fair skin! ",0
"This is a really solid conditioner and I've used it for several months. I didn't give it five stars because I wish it was a little more moisturizing. On the other hand, I haven't found one that I like better... yet. ",2
This is a smooth and creamy body butter good enough to eat. The scent is more real than some of the fake scents in lotions. I put it on my arms before bedtime for a little aromatherapy and I'm off to slumberland. I do wish they'd bring back the pure grapefruit scent which was a best seller. Sometimes the combinations of scents aren't as good. ,4
"this is a strange product. it's a great idea: an oil-controlling solid that goes on and blots oil. which it does- until your compact gets- I can't describe it- cakey and icky. it seems that I need to 'scrape' the surface off constantly, and the little sponge that comes with the product quickly- as in after two uses- becomes almost solidified with product. I wash it of course, but I washed it so often that it fell apart after about a week. also I found that my oily skin was 'breaking through' this product and the shine was no longer reduced; I switched to a loose powder, which works much better. it is a really neat product, and while it is usable, it does its job. the nature of it just seems to give it a short performance life. ",2
"This is a super fresh, citrusy scent that just makes you feel clean and fresh. It doesn't last all day, so I have to re-apply it during the day and it is a real pick me up when I'm feeling kind of run down. ",2
"this is a totally uplifting fragrance. it's floral combined with a deep earthy undertone. well, at least it was like that on me, as personal chemistry determines frangrance on an individual. this also transitions from day to night and lasts just as long. sadly, i cannot use this anymore as my husband, the alergenic wonder that he his, developed an alergy to it. ",2
"This is a true perfect lipstick. It goes on smoothly, lasts a long time and does not dry out your lips. Great colors. I have several and I especially love Gipsy-a warm red that's not over-powering for my fair complexion.",2
"This is at the top of my list of mascara's to go to. I like the brush tip. I never get too much mascara on it so my lashes don't get clumped up at all. It lengthens, defines and separates your lashes. The best I've tried so far, but is on the expensive end. ",4
"This is a very beautiful color, but as a 55 year old outdoors woman, it is too shiny for my tastes. The polish applies beautifully, but it has a lot of sparkle. I think it would be beautiful for a wedding, prom or for holiday parties. ",4
"This is a very convenient form for lipstick since you don't need a separate lipliner or lipliner brush. The color is very pretty but, the lipstick is rather dry and not as shiny as I would like. I make it work for me by putting on lip gloss (no color) on top of the lipstick. This also makes it last longer. ",4
"This is a very cute set, but I think over-priced for average balms. You get plenty, enough to split it up for gifts, but then it's not as cute without the box, something to keep in mind. The balm isn't too thick or goopey and they do smell great. ",3
"This is a very dark lip color. You have to like the goth look. This also is not a long lasting color, but it is still creamy, and does not dry the lips. I still like it though and do use it depending upon the look I want. I like to pair it with light to medium eye make and some color on the cheeks. ",4
"This is a very decent cleanser. It takes off most of my makeup and I've never minded the smell. But I don't love it. I actually use a blend of ground oatmeal, soap, kaolin clay and lavender oil from Soapalaya regularly, but I keep Purity for traveling and for those mornings or nights when I'm in a huge rush and can't be bothered to mix cleansing grains. Also, I still like to use a toner afterwards.",0
"This is a very different cleanser than most. It does NOT foam like a soap based cleanser. It is also NOT milky. It is more like a semi-liquid gel, with a clear appearance. It has a light botanical smell, mostly of cucumbers. I didn't know what to expect- it looked and smelled so different. However, it is extremely effective with a MINIMUM OF FUSS. It removes all eye makeup without irritation even with my contact lens in, and removes every type of foundation and blush I have ever needed to remove, which is quite a lot. Fresh Cosmetics has won awards for several wonderful top rated well known products for good reason. This cleanser is just as good as their "" stand out"" products. Give the small size a try.\nOh, and most people have not mentioned this, but a tiny bit goes a VERY long way, helping to justify the premium price. I can remove all facial makeup with a drop about the size of a pencil eraser on a moistened facial cloth.\nI also use it to cleanse my bare face, especially in the summer, when my skin is oilier. The ingredient list is impressive for its gentle and healing properties. This is a facial cleanser appropriate for all skin types, all age groups. No fuss, no frills, no arttificial coloring or fragrance, just expert Fresh Cosmetics formulation that works extremely quickly and well.",3
"This is a very fun, light fragrance. Perfect to smell lovely, but not overwhelm a fragrance sensitive crowd. Literally puts a smile on my face. One star off because, dang, that's a lot of clams for a teenie, tiny amount of product! ",2
"This is a very gentle cleanser, and does not irritate or dry out my combo skin. A little bit goes a long way. I use a dime size each wash and that was enough. It gets rid of the oil in the oily parts of my face and my face feels really moisturized afterwards. I even bought my boyfriend a bottle, and it's the only cleanser he uses now.",1
This is a very good daytime cream... my skin is dry and sensitive but using this helps to soothe it... I get the moisture my face needs and SPF 15... I've gone through a few jars already and I'm sure I'll continue to use this. ,3
This is a very good eye cream. I have sensitive eyes and this does not bother them. I usually use some very expensive eye creams and I feel so far that this stands up to them very well and seems just as good. That is quite remarkable that they actually cost over twice what this Bliss eye cream does. ,4
"This is a very good highlightening powder. The brush that came with the purchase,it just to small to handle,I use one of many eyeshadow brushes,which has a longer handle. It highlights but does not hide blemishes,or dark under eye circles. ",4
"This is a very good way to make a cologne purchase instead of buying the entire bottle only to find out later you just don't care for the scent. This way, you can try the different scents many times over to make your final decision. ",3
"This is a very handy tool. The stick is all-purpose, but I especially liked the highlighter. It's great around the brow/upper cheekbone. The rollerball is fun also- it's like a mini-massage under the eyes. ",3
"this is a very light product, more like a spa pick-me-up than a fragrance. it has a sparkling, fresh essence that is soft and beguiling. it's a bit citrus, a bit sweet, but ocean-air fresh. it's perfect for a tiring, sweaty day out in the sun; it gives you an instant boost. it's like a fresh, scented, cool breeze from a flowering orchard. it does not linger too long, but re-applying it is a joy, as you get that just-showered, renewed feeling. if you are feeling down, or overworked, or are trapped in a hot office or work setting, give this subtle but delightful scent a try. ",2
"this is a very light spray-on leave-in conditioner. it was not moisturizing enough for my hair, which is very dry as it is naturally curly, but it did moisturize a bit. it detangles well, and the dispensation mechanism makes it very easy to use. would be great if my hair were less dry. anyone with very fine hair would benefit from this, as it does moisturize weightlessly. and it smells great! ",2
"This is a very mild cleanser that removes all of my makeup with the exception of my eye makeup. I still use a remover for my eyes prior to Purity. It is milky and a tiny drop goes a looong way, so expect to have the bottle for a while. It gives my skin a clean feel without drying. Will be using this for years to come.",1
"This is a very nice lipstick for the money! It does evrything it's claimed to do... long lasting, creamy, yet stays moist and colors stay true on. I wish there more shades with a warm (orange) undertone. I love #10. I't s nice reddish brown perfect for Fall. ",4
"This is a very nice scrub! Its size is smaller than other sugar scrubs available, but the price is much sweeter, too, and still less expensive per ounce. Leaves my skin soft and smelling delicious! I will order this one again. HIghly recommended! ",4
"This is a very pretty blush. I don't know why I don't reach for it more often, but it is beautiful. I'm not a fan of the enclosed brush, as it's a little scratchy for my sensitive cheeks, but overall this is a really good product.",1
"This is a very, very nice moisturizer, and I THINK I see a better appearance in the skin on my thighs. That may, however, be due to the massaging I'm giving my skin when I apply this. My thigh circumference is a bit smaller, but not much. On the other hand, I've not been using this for long, so time will tell. ",4
"This is awesome. I have tried many various brands of ""snake oil"" guaranteed to make me 17 again. This stuff delivers what it promises. While I am not 17 anymore, my skin has drastically improved and oilness seems to be a thing of the past. It also creates a great base over which to apply my oil free makeup. I love it! ",4
This is awesome mascara. It has this neat little comb that just makes the mascara glide on. It doesn't clump or flake either. Makes your lashes look really full and thick. Wish it came in brown also. Its hard to find a mascara this good. I think the application brush is the secret here. Try it you'll absolutely love it. ,3
"This is a wonderful bronzer!! I had a problem with everything looking too orange or too dark on my fair skin, but this combo set lets me try out different shades so it's always complimentary. I use the right side on my face and the darker ones on the left during the summer & on my body for extra color! ",1
"This is a wonderful combination of creme highlighter and powder shadow. I use the highlighter all over, and the apply the shadow to the lid. It stays put all day. I've gotten compliments on my eye makeup. Sadly, I think this line has been discontinued, since it's not in the store and has been deeply discounted on line. Too bad. ",4
"This is a wonderful, creamy product which makes your eyes feel soft and less stressed in the morning. I even wear it day and night!. I would recommend it to anyone whos eyes are starting to feel dry and crepy. ",3
"This is a wonderful gloss. The color is very authentic and has a nice shine. It feels good, not a bit sticky (which is a little disconcerting as it smells like something that ought to be sweet and sticky.) Pricey, though. ",2
"This is a wonderful mascara. I got the trial size from Sephora's The Lash Stash sampler, and I love it. It separates and lengthens lashes, and best of all, no clumping. I would definitely buy this mascara.",0
This is a wonderful product. I stopped using amoisturizer and a foundation. Now this is all I need - it is perfect. I have turned my daughter on to it too. A lot of products will break our face out but not this one. Shhh don't tell anyone but now Ihave my husband using it too. He likes the SPF 15 factor! ,3
"This is both a concealer and a brightener, needs a little loose powder over it after application. It is not ""complete coverage,"" but nothing really is. When will someone make an Industrial Strength Concealer?!",4
"This is by far my favorite Lip Gloss. I wear it over Smashbox liner and it is so nice and sheer. I also love the Color True but I don't think it's available anymore. Very Sheer, light, beautiful color! ",2
This is by far my favorite tool for blushing. It goes on sheer and stays put & fresh all day. I have oily complexion and everything else just disappears by the end of the day. With Stilla I still have a fresh cheek look. When I pair it with my lips I look fresh and very dewey. A sheer gloss works well over it on your lips. ,3
"This is by far, my most favorite Philosophy scent and product line. I am a nurse of 22 years and both my co-workers and patients love the way it uplifts them when they sense its presence! I only wish I had discovered Philosophy sooner in life!!! ",3
"This is by far one of the most versatile blush colors on the market. I have been using this for over 4 years and I still get asked about the product. The color 'O' seems to have a chameleon like ability to work on different skin tones. However, I do not use this product in the summer months as it is an intense color and performs better with full foundation as a base.",2
This is by far the best blush I have ever tried. The color looks amazing on almost everyone (my friend who has a darker complexion then mine also loves the way it looks on her). GIves you a flushed youthful glow.,1
"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST BRUSH SET EVER!!! I HAVE TRIED MANY DIFFERENT SETS FROM HIGH END LINES TOO AND THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!! ITS SO LUXURIOUS AND THERE ANTI BACTERIAL TOO. THERE A LITTLE MORE COSTLY, THEN THE AVERAGE BRUSH SET, BUT THEY ARE SO SO WORTH IT AND THESE A SUPERB QUALITY. IF YOU TRIED THE REST LIKE I HAVE YOU NEED TO TRY THE BEST,.... THIS IS IT ",1
"This is by far the best concealer I have ever used. Covers age spots, brown spots, and veins. It stays in place all day abd doesn't cake. I don't use it under my eyes because I find that it settles in the creases however.",4
This is by far the best lip pencil I've ever tried. Goes on smooth - does not pull my skin at all like some pencils do. It wears well too. I purchased the nude color which I wear with both glosses and lipstick. ,2
This is by far the best lipstick I have found. I don't like lipsticks/glosses that are really thick and this is perfect for making my lips feel moisturized. I also love the color and the hint of sparkle. It's perfect!! ,1
this is by far the best mascara ever!!! it makes my lashes almost look fake! the biggest downfall is that you really do have to replace it every 3 months because it dries out by month 3..and NO---I DO NOT PUMP THE TUBE! and the price keeps going up every time I buy it... ,2
"This is by far the best mascara I have ever used. It separates, lengthens and thickens lashes like you would not believe. There is no clumping or flaking nor are there any fibers that get in your eyes. I would urge everyone to buy this product! ",3
"This is by far the best powder blush that I have ever used. I used Nars Desire on my wedding day, and it looked great in the pictures, didn't clog my pores, and lasted the whole night! The best part - it looks sooooooo natural! I give this 5 out of 5 and would recommend NARS to anyone!",1
"This is by far the BEST powder I have ever used! I used to have to blot my face every hour and now I do it once a day since using this. Even better, it doesn't settle into any lines. It's crazy how great this is. ",1
"This is BY FAR the best primer I've ever used. The packaging is annoying and too cutsie by far, and I never am sure that I've used all the product, but the product is superb. (I have used the technique of using forceps to remove the white plastic inner top and then using cotton swabs to get to the last bit, but the manufacturer should redesign the package to make this unnecessary.) With a little practice, I've learned to dab on a small amount of primer, spread it with my ring finger on my entire upper eye and just below the eye, let it dry completely and clear, and then apply eye shadow for nearly all day perfect wear. ",2
"This is by far the best red lipstick on the market. It is THE perfect red...looks good on everyone, lasts a long time, doesn't make my lips feel dry after I use it. Nars lipstick is expensive, but definitely worth it.",1
this is BY FAR the BEST smelling perfume EVER!!!!!\n\nthis is the only perfume i've found that actually stays with you without multiple sprays. You should DEFINITELY try it and experience it for yourself!!!,0
"This is definitely one of my top five mascaras. It is EXCELLENT at lengthening and defining. I don't think the brush is hard to use, and the wet formula is great because you can put on multiple coats before it starts to dry (which causes clumping.)\n\nThis is one of the only mascaras I've used where people tell me how amazing my eyelashes look. Five stars for sky high lengths and definition from a mascara.",0
"This is excellent. My face is dry and red due to a recent pregnancy. This blends and covers flawlessly. I do reccomend a brush because the puff it comes with is ok, not perfect. Lasts all day too. No need to use a primer under this. Very pleased. ",1
"This is FABU!! I have oily/combo skin but my eyelids are really oily! This is the only product ever to really work. My shadow stays on all day, even when the rest of my make-up is gone!! Best primer ever!!! ",3
This is fabulous. I have been a user of the meteorites poweder for a long time - just haven't been able to find anything to top it until now. This new addition to the line is wonderful. You need a very small amount and it sets your foundation beautifully or use it alone for a great look also. Give it a try. It is an expensive product but worth it. ,3
"This is fabulous! It is the best eye makeup remover I have ever used, I would recommend to to everyone. It is very gentle but easily removes makeup. And a little goes a long ways. I have had to for a couple of weeks and there is hardly any gone!! ",2
"This is for women who don't want heavy foundation, but just something to even out their skintone. If you have bad skin, this is not for you. All this does is ""enhance"" already good skin and give it some sun protection. It's light and weightless on the skin. Feels very natural. And, looks very natural. People will not think you have anything on IMHO. ",4
"This is great by itself for my daytime, run the kids around town routine. At night, a dusting of powder on top gives me the perfect complexion look I want for an evening out. And it's the perfect weight for my oily skin. I love this stuff! ",2
This is great cleanser. It is gentle on my sensative skin and cleanses my face with make up very well. I recommend using a face cloth to really remove all the makeup. Great for morning cleansing as well. I highly recommend Shiseido cleansers. ,2
"This is great for a quick, at home, french manicure. It's takes a few to get used to...but once you have it mastered, it looks great. I'm not saying it looks better than getting a manicure...but it's fun if you wanna save a few pennies here and there:) ",1
"This is great for hair that's too dry to wash every day. It soaks up the extra oil. I took away one star for the relatively strong smell, and the fact that since it's a powder it's easy to get it on clothes. ",2
"This is great for us girls with perennial dark circles under the eyes. Using the EyeLighter makes it look like i have slept once in the past week. My only complaint is it creases if you use it around the lower rim of your eye. But you can blend it, so it's not too big a deal. ",0
"This is great-smelling, but, unfortunately, not on me. It didn't smell even a little bit like either sugar or lemon on my skin, more like an astringent. I gave it to a friend and it smells super on her. Grrrr. Go figure.\nShipping was great, packing was very good , will buy from Sephora again soon.",4
this is great to see the difference in mascara's I've only used 3 so far but I do see differences and look forward to trying the others before picking a favorite. It is a good buy to try other brands in a small amount ,3
"This is honestly one of the worst shower gels I have ever used. The verbena scent is true and refreshing. However, this gel hardly lathered at all for me. I found myself using tons more shower gel than I have with other brands. I won't be making any repeat purchases of this gel.",1
"This is it! All you need for pretty feet. Face i,t when you are in bed with no makeup you want your feet soft and pretty. Don't you hate seeing a stylish woman with bad feet?I wear sandals almost year round and love my feet! I use it almost every day for soft heels... AND the smell is amazing! Lavendar and Eucalyptus. I hope they never cahnge a thing about this. I have bought this for about 10 of my close friends and they are hooked! ",3
"This is it!! The ONLY primer you will ever use! It keeps shadow put all day long, and keeps eyelids moisturized. I have tried every product and nothing works as good as this stuff! Once you try it you will never go without it!! ",3
"This is just like the normal Lip Venom, but with a nice silver shine. I like this because of that little change as it does give you lips a more shimmering look to it while keeping the slight plumping action and refreshing tingling. ",0
"This is just the thing for cleansing skin that is being dehydrated by winter heating systems. Formulated without drying/stripping additives, the fragrance alone might make it worth it, but this also leaves skin silky and soft. Would definitely recommend, especially for winter-dry skin. ",4
"This is kit is what got me started/addicted to Bare Escentuals. It has all of the brushes you need to get a feel for how to use the mineral makeup. I love the foundation. I don't care much for the mineral veil as it seems to fall into my wrinkle lines but my 22 year old roommate (to whom I gave a kit) doesn't leave home without it. Neither of us can use the ""warm"" during the day but we will each use it sparingly at night. Overall great product. ",2
"This is like having elegance in a spray. It's so feminine and sensual. Lasts for several hours and makes each day seem like a garden surrounds me. Not cloying floral, but a warm summery day. This is a wonderful fragrance! ",4
"This is made more for spot treatment. When put all over your face, it seems to dry out...I guess it depends on how greasy your face is. It seems to dry up my bigger pimples here and there, I'll be purchasing it again. ",1
"This is more like base makeup light....it's not heavy like regular base foundation. I first started using it in the hot summer for some coverage that was also not going to block pores. I am fortunate to have good, clear skin. This enhances it nicely and blends in perfectly so it looks very natural. If you have poor skin and need to cover flaws, however, this is not the product for you. ",4
This is much more highly pigmented than the regular Tarte Cheek Stain. Took some getting used to in application to avoid looking like a clown with my fair skin. Might be better for medium and dark skin tones. ,3
"This is my #1 beauty tool! It has made my complexion gorgeous! This brush really gives my skin the ultimate clean feeling. It leaves my skin soft and smooth and glowing, while allowing my skincare products to absorb better. It gives me the perfect everyday exfoliation. Pricey, but SO worth it! ",0
"This is my #1 MUST HAVE! It gets rid of those little red bumps on your arms and makes your skin so soft. I use it all over but it was a little too strong for the lower neck/chest area. My boyfriend complemented me on how soft my skin was after using it for only a few days. I put it on right after taking a shower while my skin is still moist. It is expensive, but worth every penny. I have been using it for about 6 months now and I will never go without! ",2
"This is my 2nd jar of this scrub. It is totally worth the price because it really does a great job exfoliating and you get so much of it. I do use it only a couple of times a week and it's great before shaving: legs, bikini, and underarms. Never been softer. The smell isn't nice at all, but that's a small sacrifice to make for the results you get.",2
"This is my absolute favorite shadow combination (and that is saying a LOT!)! The ivory, linen & charcoal shades would work well on anyone, and can go from daytime natural to dramatic for evening. If I could only have one shadow, this would be the one. ",3
This is my age saver. I have great genes and look younger than I am but I still need assistance from great products and this one fills in the crows feet and hides the dark circles 3 12 hour nursing shifts gives me. Noone wants a tired looking nurse! ,3
"this is my all time favorite mascara, I had no problem with clumping, the instant I put it on my eyelashes they are darker , fuller and thicker. I have light sparse eyelashes, I will buy this product again the brush is unique and easy to use ",4
"This is my all time favorite perfume. I started wearing it nearly 2 years ago and still haven't gotten tired of it which is a big deal because I am a seasonal perfume wearer.\nI LOVE mixing it with Amazing Grace Lotion by Philosophy. They are both very light and clean smells that last all day. I get so many compliments from wearing this perfume, both men and woman.",0
This is my all time number one must have from Philosophy. Having one bottle in the shower that can do everything is great...whoever created this is a genius. Not only does it feel great on your skin but it smells like a dream!!!,1
"This is my best sephora product that i have ever invested in.The quality superb!!I have the 3 speed one.My skin has never felt so clean !When i travel without it i feel like theres still this layer in my skin that wants to be lifted out, but only clarisonic can take care of that.Makeup removed fast!wow!!thanks for the makers of this wonderful gadget!! ",0
"This is my daily go-to. I use combinations of the body wash, spritz, body fragarnce and roll-on depending on my mood. Pure Grace is subtle enough (not overpowering) that I can wear it to work were I work with sevel scent-sensitive people. I've received compliments while wearing this.",2
"This is my favorite Bare box, the colors are beautiful and when we travel I use the box to hold my necessities. It also has a mirror in the box so my fiance thinks I am the ultra prepared woman thanks to Sephora!! ",2
"This is my favorite beauty product in my makeup collection. Love the way it makes my skin look perfect in any light. Receive numerous compliments on my so callled ""perfect skin"", and plan on using it forever. Thank you Smashbox for your amazing product.",4
This is my favorite blush (the review system would not let me list the color I like best-labeled it as profanity). It is so smooth going on and lasts all day. I have been using it for what seems like ages but it looks barely touched so NARS blush is a good value too.,1
"This is my favorite bronzer. I had been using this befroe and i had bought 2 more after my first one, i started having money problems so I started searching for cheaper or bigger bronzers even though this one is pretty big nothing ever came close to the quality and color of Laguna. I have light skin so Laguna goes perfect with my skin it has subtle shimmer and never looks orange which was a problem I was having with other bronzers. It really makes you look like you have a healthy tan. Love it!!!",0
"This is my favorite cleanser. I've tried quite a few and this one is really great. Since it is PH-balanced it can be used to remove your eye makeup without stinging your eyes and it is very gentle. It leaves my skin very happy. I have problems with cleansers over drying my skin and this one does not. The only thing I am not terribly fond of is the smell, but I've become accustom to it.",1
This is my favorite cream of all time. I tried to find an alternate because this one is so expensive.... but it wasn't worth it. This cream is worth every penny. It is a bit heavy...so if you don't like that its not for you. A little goes far and it smells great. I have very sensitive skin and have no problems with this cream. Treat yourself...your skin feels so good ! ,4
"This is my favorite everyday moisturizer. I used to use Hope in a Jar and then a sunscreen, but stumbled on this and like it even better. It moisturizes well, isn't greasy, doesn't irritate my skin, and doesn't have a stinky sunscreen smell. I'm hooked! ",3
This is my favorite fragrance from Dior. It has the perfect balance of elegance and sophistication. I can wear this day or night and the complements come from all over. This is a perfect scent for anyone!,0
"This is my favorite... it darkens the lashes nicely and adds length without looking messy... the brush is different but actually works pretty well... I like mascara in general so I've tried quite a few brands, but I always have this one on hand. ",3
"this is my favorite lip gloss product because of its lovely scent and its non-sticky feel. my only gripes are that it doesn't come in a tube (for those times at work when your hands might not be the cleanest) and the fact that it has a tendency to melt in hot weather, making opening the container a small disaster. keep it cool!",1
"This is my favorite mascara of all time. It creates huge lashes and doesn't clump. My only complaint is that it's really hard to come by! I had the mascara in ""Brun Starlet"" a few years ago, and haven't been able to find it since. I'm using the ""Noir Glamour"" now and love it. If you love big lashes, this is for you! ",1
"This is my favorite mascara of all time! It never disappoints. Even when I try new, innovative mascaras, I always come back to this one. It gives me long, natural looking lashes that make my eyes pop. Quality product.",0
"This is my favorite of the Amazing line of perfumes. I like them all, but Baby Grace is lighter and pure clean. Not so light that you can't smell it, just a clean, natural, unobtrusive lingering delight. Men have given more compliments on this product than any other. ",4
"This is my favorite of the Grace scents. It is so clean and fresh. It foams well, so that you don't have to use a lot in a pouf to get yourself clean. It is great for layering with the lotion and spray.",1
"This is my favorite perfume... EVER! My boyfriend loves it, and my guy friends always ask me what it is and say I smell like candy. If you're not into sweet, cotton-candy smells, then you obviously won't like it, but this is so playful and fun. My absolute scent staple!",0
"This is my favorite perfume .It smells totally different on skin than on a paper tester card. It does smell clean , but it is a sophisticated fragrance.It has a warmth and depth to it, without being overwhelming. The bath gel and lotion smell just like the colonge.I have been told it is very sexy. ",3
"This is my favorite scent in the philosophy line. Overall their shower gels are hands down, bar none, the best in the world. They are thick and rich and you get tons of lather. Amazing Grace has been my perfume of choice for years and to get that scent in the shower starts my day off on a good note.",1
"This is my favorite under eye concealer ever. It is very soft, doesn't crease and looks perfect every time. While it can be used on the lids too, I don't like it as much as a shadow base as it seems a little to dry--though it does work well for that despite the dryness. ",2
This is my first ever experience with Nars lip gloss and I am so impressed! I love that the formula lasts without being sticky. The colors are great and perfect for sticking in a clutch or small handbag. ,2
"This is my first experience with Murad products. The set seemed to be a good value. I normally use upscale facial products and found the day cream and eye cream to be consistent with what I've been used to using. I do, especially, like the flavored lip therapy ",4
"This is my first time using Bare Escentuals, I followed the direction's for ordering and it was very exact. The dvd was good and the product is supper! my skin looks so good and the color last all day.. ",3
"This is my first venture into Bare Escentuals blush, eyeshadow/liner collection. I truly love the eyeshadows and liner. They are exquisite. The mascara is clumpy and the lip gloss comes right off but I still love this set. My only wish is that the shadows and liner were waterproof. I need waterproof. I have already ordered more shadows (the set of 9) and can't wait to use them. The blush is amazing too. I can't believe the incredibly low price for all of these goodies! ",2
"This is my fourth Flashy Liner I have purchased from Sephora. It goes on easily and smoothly and doesn't tug on my eyelids. I love that it stays on all day, doesn't smear, and comes off easily at night when I want it to. I normally don't wear black eyeliner, but this is the perfect black for me. I can apply it lightly for daytime or darker for evening wear. ",3
"This is my ""go to"" cleanser when I am breaking out or particularly oily (I ususally have combination skin; but sometimes breakout even though I am 35!). This cleanser is gentle enough to use every day. I use this and the gentle cleanser and love them both. ",2
"This is my ""go-to"" product every time I'm having problems with hair loss. Whether it's stress, poor diet, or medication, it always works for me. Hair grows back. The day I use it, I don't put any product in my hair and it looks shiney and frizz-free. ",4
"This is my HG sunscreen and one of the ONLY products that I have bought twice in a row. I've been using this product for about a year now. I have sensitive combination skin and I am allergic to some types of chemical sunscreen (octinoxate, for one) and other compounds used in cosmetics and skincare products. This product does not make me break out in acne or in hives and doesn't sting my eyes. It's active ingredients are what are called ""physical"" sunscreens which provide excellent broad spectrum coverage. I also really like the texture and the fact that it isn't super runny. It's not horribly greasy either and the tint really evens out my skin tone so that I don't even have to wear any foundation. I usually wear bareminerals foundation on top for a little extra sun protection and the powder totally takes care of any grease problem there may have been. And like the above person said, really don't let the color scare you. It is really sheer and blends so well. I wore this all last winter with nothing but blush on top. ",0
"This is my mom's favorite perfume. It always reminds me of her when I smell it. It as such an alluring, beautiful, light, sophisticated smell, just like my mom! I wore it as a teenager and it was appropriate. It's very elegant.\nI wear it to work or out to dinner. I love it.",0
"This is my most favorite scent...No matter what clothes you have on, this perfume just works. It's sweet, but no overpowering. And it's also appropriate for young girls to wear. My 5yo son & ferret love it, too!",2
"This is my most favorite scent of all. I already have a bottle of J'adore at home, but I seriously couldn't resist buying this. The pouch is so adorable and having another bottle of J'adore can't hurt! The lotion and the body gel smells just like the perfume, but I have yet to use it yet. ",0
This is my new FAVORITE BRUSH to set concealer with Translucent Powder. I also use it to apply Powder to specific areas like around the lipline (sets but doesn't show). I've also used to apply powder eyeshadow as a base for the lid. It's synthetic so can be washed after every use (better application when clean) and dries faster. No shedding of bristles. ,4
"This is my new favorite scent. I am a fragrance and product junkie. I got a sample of KenzoAmour and loved it, but decided to try purchasing this one first. I'm so glad I did. I've received complements on this perfume, even when I thought the fragrance was gone, and my mother, who's allergic to almost everything, likes it on me. I will continue to wear it almost everyday. ",2
"This is my new signature scent, I get so many compliments on it because it is light, fresh, not overwhelming and just draws you in. The light scent of basil is hard to describe, not food-like, but more freshly showered and refreshed smelling. It is a pick me up on a hot summer day. ",2
"This is my second favorite mascara. I don't use it as much as I should, and I haven't really tried layering it much... hmm...\nOk. I just tested it alongside Too Faced Lash Injection\nI still like Too Faced's better, but they both layer really nicely, BADgal's not got quite as much impact though. Still, a really good mascara.",0
"This is my second pair of Tweezerman tweezers. I keep on pair on my purse makeup bag and another in my actual makeup bag at home. The first pair I bought 4 years ago and it still works great! I recently purchased the zebra print tweezers and they are adorable. My only complaint about the new pair was they were very, very sharp and I cut the area underneath my eyebrow the first time I used them. So my suggestion is to be careful. Other than that, this is a product that is definitely worth the money! ",0
This is my second purchase of the lip stain. It's long lasting but not drying like a lot of the long wearing lip colors can be. I really like the double tube with lip gloss. Takes up less room in my makeup bag! ,3
This is my signature fragrance. It reminds me of my mother and whenever I wear it I feel close to her. I have received soooo many compliments on this fragrance and I hope my girls will perpetuate this beautiful tradition.,4
"This is my signature perfume, and have been for years. It is feminine and glamourous, yet vey sensual and inviting. The bottle is also very beautiful. I wear it everyday, and if there is and special occation; J'adore is what I sleep in.",0
This is my signature perfume. I'm always looking for new and different scents. But I always come back to this one as my favorite. Most perfumes that come out always smell like something else that's been done before. This one is truly different and unique. I get the most compliments of any scent I have when I wear Light Blue. It works for day or night. Is fresh and clean and lingers. My all-time favorite.,4
"This is my signature scent. I rarely wear any other fragrance. I' am a nurse so I can't wear scents that are overpowering. This is perfect. i get so mant compliments on ""smelling good."" I recommend this product for everyone and be prepared for the compliments! ",3
"This is my signature sent. I wear it every day and I always get compliments (mostly from men, hello!). It smells sweet like a decadent dessert, but it's not cloying or childish. The body soufle is not smooth, creamy, or light. It feels wet and greasy. I don't recommend it. Not worth 30 bucks by any means. But the eau de toilette is yummy. Spray it now, thank me later!",2
"This is my third Smashbox kit and I love them. The colors are always right and the products come in quantities that let me get used to the products. Photo finish is always a treat, but the check stuff and the creamy eye liner I love. I travel a lot and the sizes are perfect and one can never have enough Caviar ... the eye liner I love. ",4
"This is my third Urban Decay palette purchase and by far my favorite. The colors are brilliant, with a good mix of glitter and shimmer options. I was a little wary of the pull-out design, but it is not so bad. And when I travel, I don't have to worry about it coming open in my makeup bag. Overall, I'm in love. ",0
"This is not my usual taste in fragrance, which tend to be orientals with identifiable citrus topnotes. This is complex, very European, sexy, mature. Other people have mentioned that they can really smell the chocolate in this; I can't. There's a chocolate note, perhaps, but it's rich with nuts and fruits and flowers and amazingly complex and sophisticated. It may be my favorite winter fragrance. . . ",3
This is now a staple in my hair care routine. I have fine wavy hair that I can wear either curly or straight. This stuff just seals the hair and makes it shine like crazy. Helps with frizzing in humidity too. Its lite enough to use on my hair that usually gets weighed down with other serum/oily products. I only use one drop at a time so even the travel size will last a good long time. ,2
"This isn't my favorite cleanser, but I have very sensitive, dry skin. I just don't think that Purity Made Simple and my skin were made for each other, but it's not a bad cleanser at all. It just dried me out a bit, though it was very thoroughly cleansing. I'd recommend buying a small size or sample to start off, just to make sure it's something that works for you.",0
"This is okay, but not any more effective than other similar productsI've used, and some are less expensive but are just as effective.. I'm trying to discern what makes this one unique from the rest - I have to be convinced further. ",4
"This is OK for touch ups, but I wouldn't use it as my daily base makeup. They claim a little goes along way, which is true. But, there isn't much in the tube to begin with. I have fair skin and the color also is accurate. ",4
"This is ok, haven't really noticed my lips looking any different. I think the price is to high, but then it does last a long time. Does feel good on lips has slight sweet taste to it. Cons: hard to get the right amount out of the tube. Seems like I get to much at one time. ",3
"This is one of my all time favorites for eyes. It is great for pressed powder shadows or loose pigment/shadows. The perfect size to get a nice touch of color under your eyes that is wider than a liner brush, but still not over-do under the eyes. Perfect for the inner corners also. Great for blending liner into shadow. ",3
"This is one of my favorite and most wearable fragrances. I thought I might be ""too old"" to wear it, but it turned out that once I put it on and it warmed on my skin, I smelled like warm, freshly made cotton candy and yet, I didn't smell like food. It's hard to explain, but to categorize this as a food scent is to simplify it too much. It's simple but fun and sparkling---anyone could wear this and smell kissable, regardless of age.",1
"This is one of my favorite beauty products, and the second year in a row that I have bought them. I love the lip-plumping effect, and the subtle color the give my lips is perfect for me. I always have one in my purse. ",3
"This is one of my favorite BE products! It's not designed to be used to remove a face full of make-up, but more of a spot removal (when mascara get's on your face, etc). I have one in my car, my office and home! I don't leave home without it! An excellent product and an incredible value! ",3
"This is one of my favorite daytime eye creams. It is light, absorbs quickly without leaving an greasy residue, but still leaves my eye area perfectly moisturized and smooth all day long. I would say it's probably best for prevention though. I don't have puffiness, so I can't comment on that aspect. My makeup goes on beautifully over it, and I've been very pleased with it. ",0
This is one of my favorite products EVER! I use it everyday to brighten up my eyes. I have to get up very early and this really helps me look awake. I dab it in the corner of my eyes and on my lid. It is super easy and beautifully sparkly. This is a product that I personally will never be without. ,1
"This is one of my favorite products. Is one of those few products that actually delivers what it promess. When you apply it the feeling is amazing, softer than a baby's bottom, the foundation goes on so smoothly you won't believe it...it's just perfection. I really hope this product never gets discontinued, I just wish they use some other kind of packaging where you can use the entire product, it's really dificult to squeeze! But believe me it's woth the money, it's one of the best primers ever! ",1
This is one of my favorite scents of all. It really has such a nice fragrance and it does put me in a good mood when I smell it. My only complaint is that the scent doesn't seem to have staying power unless I spray it on my clothes. ,2
"This is one of my favorites. My daughter and I both love this. We like the soft powdery scents. This is a very clean scent, and I get so many compliments on it. I would highly recommend everyone to test this fragrance.",3
"This is one of my first purchase of NARS b/c I just had to see what all the hype was about! It looks so pretty but also intimidating b/c of all the chunky gold glitter. I've only worn it once but it gives a great soft pink color that you can wear w/ warm eyes/skin tone. Absolutely love it. I didn't see in chunks of glitter on my face just a nice sheen, so I can def wear it in the daytime! A Must Buy! ",0
"This is one of my most favorite blushes to use! I never was much of a blush gal but am finding that I need a little color in my life! I have very pale minnesota skin and this gives me the right amount of flush. Plus with a name like orgasm, what's not to love. This also seems to last a long time, although I have had it for 6 months or so I still haven't hit the bottom.",1
"This is one of my new must have products. My brows look fantastic all day with one swipe of this baby. Just note, a little goes a long way. If I had to grab five products to rush out the door with, this would be one of them!",0
"This is one of the best bronzers I have ever used. I wear bronzer all year-round, so I need something natural--something that does not make me look artificial. This bronzer picks up so nicely on your bronzer brush (I use Sephora brand). The pigments glide on the skin very smoothly, so it does not leave blotches like some bronzers may. Its a beautiful tan/peachy brown, with subtle gold glimmer. I use it day and night!",0
"This is one of the best compacts I've ever bought for oil control. It only comes in 3 shades, but the one I chose seems to blend right in (before my tan). If you have dry skin though in some areas (combo skin) then you can take a cotton ball and blot with that because this compact doesn't work so well on dry skin. ",1
This is one of the best facial cleansers and shave soaps on the market. It easily suds and leaves your skin soft and silky. My husband uses it for his face too. Purity is one of Philosophy's best products.,4
"This is one of the best foundations I have found to date. It provides medium coverage without being too cakey, though it does take some getting used to in learning how to apply it correctly (the first few times I applied WAY too much and did more harm then good). I found myself to be more in between colors, so sometimes I mix two together for a closer match. I have combo skin and would not recommend this product for anyone with extremely dry skin. I also HATE the B.E. brushes intended for this product, so I have found my own.",0
"This is one of the best fragrances not just because of it's wonderfully sweet scent, but because of it's lasting quality. This is one fragrance I have no trouble worrying about staying with me for extensive periods of time. Love it.",0
"This is one of the best lipsticks... the consistency is just about perfect and feels great when you put it on... it's creamy, moisurizing and has great staying power... I wish Laura Mercier would offer even more colors in this formula. ",3
"This is one of the best mascaras I have used to lengthen and thicken. It makes me look like I have false eyelashes on. However, it can make my eyes itchy if I don't spend a lot of time removing it at the end of the day. Definitely needs a good makeup remover after washing face with soap and water. I also accidentally bent the end of my wand a bit, but it turns out to work much better with that angle...I'd bend it on purpose next time. ",1
"This is one of the best mascaras I've found, that when apllied in an upward motion curls lashes and they stay curled all day... never drooping. It does not volumize which is the reason for the 4 rating, but does separate.",4
This is one of the best primers I have tried! It is nice and smooth and feels great going on. It makes applying makeup so easy and it stays on all day. Definitely a great products for an always flawless face! ,0
"This is one of the best products I have purchased from Sephora! This blush stays on througout the day, which is a feat being a college student who gets boredin class and sits with her hands on her chin! I have recieved numerous compliments and it leaves face with a subtle yet natural looking glow! Buy it! I'm addicted!",0
"This is one of the best serums. It's all natural, has a pleasant scent. It has a milky light texture that will absorb nice and quickly into the skin. I am a very lazy person, and not good stick to my everyday routines, after 2 weeks of using it, everybody was compliment how my skin get better, it glows. It's my new addictive besides chocolate.......",1
"This is one of the coolest ideas out there. I can't believe it hasn't been thought of before. I really like how I can try out each scent for an entire day, as opposed to a 1 second sniff at the store. Definitely recomend for anyone trying to find a new scent or likes to vary their perfumes. ",1
"This is one of the most wonderful serums you can buy. Its natural, smells great, has a light, milky texture so it absorbs nicely into the skin. It brightens, helps with texture problems, and makes the skin absolutely glow. Its addictive.",1
"This is one of the products I turned all my friends onto. I love playing with eyeshadow, and this primer makes sure my ""eye art"" stays put all day. If I skip a day..yuck ! My shadow slides all over. And it does a few things...I use it all alone on my lids for a super fresh eye, or you can use it as a silky concealer..it works !!! ",2
"This is one of those fragrances that people either love or hate. It initially has a very strong, not great fragrance, but dries down to something that is soft and clean smelling. I put this fragrance on at least an hour before I'll have contact with others to allow for the drydown, otherwise it would be overpowering. It has so-so staying power, lasts about 5 hours on me.",3
"This is one of those must have shades (Orga***) for nearly every woman. It goes on smooth, stays on and best of all looks great with almost any skin tone. My girlfriend turned me onto it several years ago and she has beautiful olive skin - I thought she was so wrong until I tried it (I am fair skinned) and boy, was I wrong. Great product!",2
"this is one of those rare skin products that actually delivers - particularly for aging skin. it makes my skin glow, plus evens skin tone, reduces pore size, reduces wrinkles. tightens skin - -perfect as a primer under makeup or to be used alone under moisturizer. For those of you who are under 30 yrs old I wouldn't advise buying this - as you don't Need an industrial stregnth anti-aging product yet. ",4
"This is one of those yummy fragrances, however, it does not bring you to the bakery corner. It's notes of vanilla are enticing, but with the abricot undertones it's tricky. When I wear this I always get ""what is that great fragrance? Is it vanilla?"" It's more of a ""I just came back from an ocean front spa"" kind of smell. It also has great stay power! ",2
"This is one styling product that has it all; hold (without heavyness), shine (without limpness), UV filters (very important for all hair). And, is easy to work with (provides a little more hold than other creams or gels), yet washes out easily as well. Enough said? ",4
This is perfect! Covers and blends beautifully. I use it with the Cover FX kabuki brush and pat more on imperfections with the Cover FX concealing brush. Works better for me than anything I've ever tried. ,4
"This is perfect for an end of the day face cleanser because it not only cleanses the skin, it also removes every trace of make-up. 2-3 pumps and I was good to go! It's quick and easy and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. ",1
This is perfect for on the go! I love to keep it in my purse! It gives just the right amount. but keep the powder down and brush up or you may find a lot more in the brush than you want. But ultimately a great Stocking Stuffer! ,3
"this is perfect if you like to wear the nude lips trend. before i found this i could not get my lips nude enough- i would put foundation on my lips and that is so drying! i discovered this and holy cow! just apply with your finger, let dry, and put some nude lipgloss over it for the PERFECT nude lips! (also great under ANY shade of gloss or lipstick) ",0
"This is perfectly ""weighted"". Neither too heavy or too light. Fekkai always has just the right amout shine too make our hairstyles look healthy and vibrant but not weigh down my very fine hair and to make my son's hair move in the directions he puts it. ",4
"This is probably the best lipgloss I've used. I have it in girly grapefruit, and the scent/flavor, texture and color are amazing in their subtlety. The balm is thick but not sticky, and instantly makes my lips feel soft, full and conditioned. I wear it day and night when I feel like my lips need a shot of moisture. I've had the same tin for about a year I guess, and it is still fresh as the day I bought it. Too Faced nailed it with this one. ",0
"This is probably the best refillable purse compact I have ever seen. It's the perfect size, well constructed, easy to fill and empty, and I like the finish on the outside because it doesn't show scratches. Brilliantly made. ",4
"This is quite simply the best mineral makeup I have tried. It is the best of both worlds; the SPF and sheer coverage of a mineral make up without the mess. I have tried more expensive brands of mineral makeup, but this one is superior. ",2
"This is really a ""can't be caught dead without"" product. You can apply it alone and look absolutely fabulous or as a primer for your favorite foundation and really look Glam. But either way this is a product that just makes your skin look radiant and takes away all the oil that you may have. WOW.",3
"This is really good stuff. I makes your lashes look naturally super long. I went on a three day hiking trip and I really wanted to look all earthy-crunchy, but I'm way to old (and vain!) to go total naked face! Just this stuff and a little lip gloss and I was good to go each morning. Way less smudgy than other mascaras I've used. While the lengthening is great, it does add a lot of thickness to thin lashes like mine. If I really want a lot of wow with the eyes, I do pair it with a plumping mascara. ",3
"This is really the best facial cleanser I have used. I agree with the previous review- if you use a toner afterward, there is NO makeup or dirt on the cotton after using this product. It really cleanses your face, but doesn't dry it out at all. Works well with the Clarisonic skincare brush too.",1
This is really the perfect blusher for me. I use Amour and looks both natural and radiant and it stays put the whole day. After years of searching I finally found a blusher that does everything I want it to do.,0
"This is simply the best foundation for everyday use, and I've tried almost all of them. The introductory CD is great. My morning routine is shorter and easier. Use the different shades to achieve a day look, night look or a sun-kissed look. ",3
"This is so good as a night cream... also a great eye cream. I have oily combo skin and use this in winter day and night and nighttime in the warmer months. It not only hydrates, continued use will help smooth out the texture and tone the skin, too. ",2
"this is soo much fun. the sizes are great, the variety is fun, i think 2 of them are plum, they'll last a long time and you get exposed to many good mascaras. I think this was very smart thinking and that this makes a great gift since 'mascara is the new black'.... ",4
"This is so worth the price. Unlike cheaper shampoos, it is highly concentrated and you don't need much. It makes my fine yet somewhat wavy/fluffy hair shiny and I can easily skip a day shampooing. This is my favorite winter shampoo for the little boost it gives when humidity is low and hair is likely to get flat. It smells just lovely too, the best! Use it with the pomegranate hair rinse. ",1
"This is such a cool product. All you have to do is brush the piece of paper on your cheeks and go. It's easy and it looks really great. You can use the piece of blush paper about twice. Very effective, and the color is a nice, sheer wash that's just right. ",0
"This is such a great deal for all of the makeup in this collection. I absolutely love most of the colors, but some seem a little young for me. Some have a lot more shimmer than I prefer. Overall, I'm very satisfied and I'm glad I ordered this. ",1
This is such a great eyeshadow collection!! All of the colors are beautiful and very wearable. The olive green color is especially gorgeous . I would recommend this for anyone who loves experimenting with eyeshadow ,0
"This is such a great idea. I have the pink; not too blue or peachy. The bleach is fast and doesn't make you sensitive. As a dentist, I like applicators which can reach between teeth where the color hangs out instead of strips that just lay on the face of the teeth. I recommend it highly. ",3
This is such a great product. I have turned several people on to these. They work great along or powder shadow. They stay on great and I really love the many colors Benefit has. I use this on my clients too! Such a great product and so easy to use. ,1
"This is such a great soap. You will felel a new kind of clean. Tingles and feels great! It seems like a lot of money for a bar of soap, but trust me it lasts so long and is so worth it! You will never use another soap. ",2
"This is such a lovely body lotion. Smells llike heaven, very light (not foody to me at all). Moisturizes well but haven't noticed any firming effects. I buy it for the scent alone. I wish L'Occitane would make a perfume with this scent.\n\nIt has a nice texture too - kind of fluffy, absorbs quickly.",3
This is summer in a ball. The colors and consistency are perfect and even though summer is over I just bought another one for my cruise in the Bahamas this November. If i had one complaint it would be that you should sell these colors seperately. ,4
"This is supposed to be a sheer lipstick, but I don't think it is. It is red with very warm tone. I find tone a little too warm on my NC30ish skin tone. I would imagine it would look really lovely on someone with very warm tone. It still looks love if I applied it very sheerly with some clear lip gloss. It looks like I just slurped on an orange/cherry popsicle.",2
"This is the absolute best kit any man can have in his bathroom! Yes it is pricey, but everything is well worth it. I got this for my boyfriend and just from using it a few times the skin on his neck and face have improved drastically. He doesn't get razor bumps and hasn't had an ingrown hair since using this and his face is super-soft alllll day. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a very smooth shave!",0
"This is the absolute best product for break outs! I've tried everything dermatologist,Proactive,& just about everything the drugstore sells. This is a miracle.I started out with the kit it cleared my skin within days without drying.I use this every a.m. & p.m. to maintain.Spot treatment when needed.So happy I found it! ",2
This is the absolute best starter kit from a fabulous company. Here here is everything you need to have the best skin ever. The brushes provide even coverage and the powders are not thick or cakey. Highly recommended! ,0
"This is the absolutely, without question, the best makeup I've ever used in 30 years of makeup!! It feels like silk on your face when applied, matches my skin perfectly, covers the bad yet feels and looks totally natural. ",4
"This is the best acne cream I have ever used. My breakouts used to be chronic. Now, they are less frequent, less severe and clear up more quickly. The cool thing is that it does not dry out yiur skin. Try it. ",4
This is the best any kind any brand shadow I have ever used. It stays on all day long no matter what the weather. The colors are subtle yet you can surely see them. The stuff glides on your eyes and never pulls the delicate skin. LOVE IT !!!! ,3
"This is the best blush ever, I have the original Orgasm and the Super Orgasm, both are absolutely amazing.. they compliment my skin tone, and does not look fake or tacky. I highly recommend this colors..",1
"This is the best blush ever! It works on all skin types. There is even a hint of shimmer/sheen, which really accents your cheekbones. (This program won't actually let me list the shade of blush I like, because it is catching it as a profane word!)",1
This is the best blush ever! Touch it to your cheek and blend with a sponge. You are off for your day (and evening if you choose). The colors are beautiful even for fair skins. You will want one in every color! ,4
"This is the best blush that I have ever used. I am very fair skinned and this blush in the popular peachy-pink shade looks great on my skin. I think that this blush shade really flatters everyone. This is one beauty product that I cannot live without, it is worth the price!",0
"This is the best body scrub on the planet. No joke. I have tried many different kinds and none can hold a candle to the Fresh Brown Sugar Body Polish...It smells great, but best of all it makes your skin feel FANTASTIC after just one use. If you have dry, flaky skin, unsightly bumps, or just want a transforming spa experience (or all of the above!) this is the perfect scrub for you.",0
"This is the best bronzer I've tried. I will use it year round. It doesn't look orange at all, and it's not too shimmery or matte like a lot that I have tried. The glow you get is very natural, even in daylight.",1
This is the best brow gel I have ever tried. I've been using Benefit's speed brow for many years (and lately it does not seem to work well at all - have they changed the formula?). Anastasia's product blows it away.,1
"This is the best brush ever!! I used the buki brush that came with the kit and it worked okay, but I always had a few acne spots or brown spots that I could not cover. This brush does the trick. It is very similar to a foundation brush that you would use with liquid foundation. It really gives concentrated coverage. ",3
This is the best brush I ever bought especially for liquid and mousse foundations - it really does give an airbrushed look. I loved it so much I bought two more for applying powder. It also washes like a dream with soap and warm water. I have paid much more for brushes in the past that didn't work nearly as well especially when applying foundation. ,3
"This is the best cleanser I have ever tried. I had HORRIBLE skin, and no matter what I product I used I could never get rid of my whiteheads, blackheads, and pimples, not to mention my large pores. After a few days, only days, everything was clearing up and my pores were becoming noticeably smaller! The last three months with Purity Made Simple I have had the best skin since puberty!",0
"This is the best cleanser I have ever used!! It leaves my skin incredily clean, yet not tight and dry. I have mild adult acne and this is the only thing I have found that keeps it under control without drying my face.",2
"This IS the best cleanser you will ever use! I've used so many different brands, I cannot list them all, but this is the absolute best...I keep a bottle next to my bathroom sink, in the shower, in my travel kit, etc. Cannot be without it! However, if you use waterproof mascara, use an eye makeup specifically designed for waterproof mascara. This product does not remove waterproof mascara.",3
"this is THE BEST concealer for dark circles i have ever used. i have very dark circles, not just under, but completely around my eyes. this covers them completely, is never cakey, and does not crease!! it is buildable, so you can use it for light coverage or heavy. it works well for redness too. i was very skeptical before i bought this, thinking that a powder concealer just wouldn't give good coverage, but i am so glad i was wrong!!!! ",1
"This is the BEST concealer I've used. There are two shades, one for under eye and the other on the face. The under eye is creamy and blendable but does not settle into lines, pores or smear. The other is a bit drier but very workable if you warm it up a bit on your hand (like a palette). These may also be belnded for the perfect shade. They may be applied witht the LM Concelaler brush or fingertip. ",4
This is the best cream blush I've come across I think. It's easy to blend and gives my skin a very nice glow and the color isn't overpowering. I bought the Hip peach first and now the catwalk pink. Both are very flattering. ,2
This is the best deodorant I've ever used. The odor is great and keeps me dry all day long. And the most important thing it doesn't leave any white marks in my clothes. I recommend it for the 4 seasons of the year.,1
This is the best eye defining kit ever. It has everything you need to create the perfect look for daytime or evening. All you need to add is mascara and you are all set. I love this kit. It is all the eye product I ever wear and it is fabulous. ,4
This is the best eyelash curler I've ever used! It has less of a curve than the other brands I've tried - thus getting all the corner lashes curled. The combination of the design of the tool and the silicone pad make for great curled lashes when mascara is applied immediately after curling. After using mine I purchased three more for gifts! ,2
"This is the best eyeshadow. The shades are beautiful, go on smooth, and last all day. you don't need to put a lot on to get great color and the container lasts a long time. Be careful you don't drop it on a hard surface because the powder can shatter easily. ",1
"This is the best eylash curler made. I've used it for years and have the regular as well as the mini"". it's the best for several reasons... first the arc of the curler and ""rubber"" are wider than standard curlers so you're able to curl more lashes. The rubber is also softer than most (it wears out an the curler will need to be replaced) so it doesn't require ""break in"" like most curlers. The best way to use is with clean lashes before masacara... gently press and count to 10, repeat on other eye, repeat process 3 times and then apply your favorite mascara! Your lashes will be curled, separated and you won't have breakage. ",4
This is the best face cream for sensitive skin and I have been using it for years... it's very soothing and moisturizes my face without irritating it... I have tried other higher end products but keep coming back to this one. ,3
"This is the BEST facewash, I use it with the Hope in a Jar moisturizer and I noticed a difference in my skin immediately! My pores looked smaller and I have fewer breakouts. I don't think I'll ever use anything else.",1
"This is the best facewash I've ever used. I got it as part of a set and wasn't too keen on the scent, but it just works so well. It takes all my makeup off in one step without over drying my skin. It is gentle enough to clean your makeup brushes as well. I have gotten many others hooked on this product as well.",1
"This is the best facial cleanser and make-up remover that I've used by far. My face felt clean,not dried out. It was if my face felt like it took in a breath of fresh air after I washed it with this cleanser!",2
"This is the best file ever! It has a nice fine grit so it leaves nail edges smooth, and just rinse it under running water to clean! I keep one at home and one in my purse. As long as you don't drop it on a hard surface and break it by mistake (been there, done that!), it will last forever! Highly recommended. ",3
"This is the best foundation I've ever used. Formula/Texture: like no other foundation I've ever tried. Spreads smoothly & evenly, but your skin absorbs it quickly, so after 4 or 5 seconds, your fingers (or brush) glide along the top of your face spreading nothing, because it has been absorbed completely - leaving a ""real skin"" finish, as in no discernable ""feel"" at all! Very bizarro/cutting edge. So you need to work fast each time you apply it to a section of your face. Just spread it/brush it quickly & you're good to go. Coverage: fabulous, without any sign of buildup/cakiness. Just as the texture ""feels"" like real skin, the coverage *looks* like real skin. It is buildable to a medium/almost full level of coverage. I use very little concealer now. Just under the eyes. Shade: Linen #021 is pure perfection for me. (For comparison purposes, other shades that work for me are: Clair #20 in Chanel Teint Innocence compact; BF20 in CledePeau Satin; #764 in Shu Face Architect), and It is semi-light with a candle-lit golden tone to it. Completely counteracts the pink in my cheeks. Finish: This is pretty close to a matte finish: no dewiness, though there is the slightest bit of light reflection when outside. In that sense, again, it looks like real skin. It is absolutely non-transferable, yet, having said that, you do not feel it all: not when you touch your face - never. As I said, it's truly state-of-the-art. It is magically waterproof. I can't recommend it highly enough, and I am delighted to have found it. ",3
this is the best fragrance for all types and ages. it simply makes you smell and feel good. i have given it to many friends as gifts and everyone has gone and purchases it for herself. it can make your day.,4
"This is the best fragrance I have used in a very long time. There isn't a day that goes by when I am wearing it that someone says ""You smell wonderful; what are you wearing."" It is very light, but it is perfect for every occasion.",4
"This is the best I've ever had, and I've tried evrything. Great taste and smell, but the best moisturizer I have ever used. I always have one in purse and one at home. I have hooked so many on this one . IT is great!! ",2
"This is the best lip balm that my hubby and I have ever tried. It really makes your lips feel smooth and moisturized. It gets rid of any dry, rough lips. It's worth every penny! Lemon and Chamomile is my favorite of the trio. ",3
"This is the best lipgloss in the world!! I have 7 of them, and they are all flattering. Plus, they aren't gooey (as long as you don't pile it on) and they smell delicious. I also like the fact that they are all interchangable. Thank you, Tarte!!! =) ",1
"this is the best lip plumper i have ever used, it does not dry out your lips like most plumpers do. it actually works, your lips will look a lot plumper and it lasts most of the day. i just wish it was cheaper. ",2
"This is the best lipstick fixative I've ever tried (and I've tried many). A suggestion I'd like to offer: After applying, wipe brush with a clean tissue to remove any excess lipstick the brush picked up. This keeps the product from becoming ""stained"" inside the bottle. ",2
"This is THE best mascara, hands down. I have very long thick lashes and it is hard to find a mscara that doesn't clump them all up into a mess. The brush is amazing, the colour is very black and it goes in very well. I love it! ",2
"This is the best mascara I have ever tried, and I'm 56 years old! It really does stay on without flaking or smearing, even overnight, until YOU take it off! I will never go back to any other kind of mascara. Blinc Kiss Me is worth every penny!!",4
"This is the best mascara I have ever tried! I have tried too many to count. Department store, over the counter, under the counter, (LOL) you name it I've tried it! This one truly does everything! The main brush curls, seperates, and adds volume to your lashes and does not smudge, flake, or run.( even in a hot kitchen while cooking and eyes watering from cutting onions!) The small brush is great for your lower lashes. Mine are sparse & blonde so they need alot of help and also most mascaras no matter what they say smear under my eyes. Not this one! GO GUERLAIN!! A+++ mascara!! ",3
"This is the best mascara! It makes my lashes so full and black! It makes my eyes super sexy. I had the consultant at Sephora put this mascara and another popular mascara on a wand and not tell me which was which, I applied them both and wow-what a difference BadGal made on my lashes",2
"This is the BEST moisturizer for gals with combination/oily skin. I repeat, BEST MOISTURIZER!!! It's lightweight and refreshing. When I use it in conjunction with the Pore Minimizing Serum, my skin is breakout free and super soft. I'm not kidding!!! I have struggled with acne and oiliness since I was a teenager. Use the little scooper that comes with the product to avoid wasting any. Worth every single penny! ",0
This is the best pencil eyeliner I have ever used. It is a highly pigmented gel… always put the cap back on tight so it doesn't dry out. Apply and allow a minute or two for it to set-up. The colors have a lot of pigment and may be built up for more intensity. They do not smudge or smear even in high humidity. I like 2L a Bronze and 3L a deep Blue (makes the whites of the eyes whiter). You should to use eye make up remover to take off. ,4
"this is the best powder/foundation ever made. if you like a powder foundation, this one is for you. it all blends together into a smooth full coverage make up. you can wear it as a setting powder on top of your foundation or as a foundation. you can control the coverage and you can get a great full coverage with just this powder. what i like about it is it doesn't cake up and set into fine lines like most powders. i think it is because this started as a lliquid and then was baked into this compact. it is great for fair skin. never looks to heavy, just leaves your skin smooth and flawless. i think this is way better than minereal foundations. once you try this you will be hooked. and it lasts a long time. ",2
"This is the best powder I have ever used. It makes you look good, smooth, it covers your flaws without sitting heavily on your face. You put it, and you instantly feel better about yourself. I have recommended it to many friends. Give it a try!",3
"This is the BEST primer that I have ever tried. I highly recommend it to everyone. I am usually very oily and my makeup wears off throughout the day. When I wear this primer, it lasts into the night!! ",1
This is the best product I have found in years. My daughter recommended it (she loves it too) and I can't put on base without it anymore. It leaves my face flawless and at 57 I really need that. I have recommended it to many friends and I recommend it to you!,4
"This is the best product,I use it as a base for any eye shadows. I NEVER have creases or 'wear off' with this product. It also lasts forever,just 3 little dots on eyelid,goes from brow to base of lashes.\nI have used this product by itself and as a base for over 5 years.",4
This is the best shadow primer I've ever used. It absolutely keeps eyeshadow from creasing. I have super oily skin and have a lot of trouble keeping my eyeshadow from creasing through the day and this primer potion does the job. It's awesome! ,2
"This is the best shower gel ever! I love using it--it's very lightly scented, but smells amazing and is a gentle cleanser as well. I use it every day as a layering item with my Amazing Grace perfume, but it could easily be mixed with another fragrance. It doesn't dry out my skin, and I'm not overly perfumed when I dry off either.\nI love it!",1
"This is the best skin-reviving mask I've ever tried. Whether it's a long night of too much partying or stress and lack of sleep, this is the best product I've ever used for giving a healthy, well rested glow. ",3
"This is the BEST smelling cologne my husband has ever worn. I bought it last year, too. He wears it to work and has been ""sniffed up"" by LOTS of women and even men. One woman asked him what it was and when he told her ""Diesel"" she said, ""Well, if you didn't want me to know what it was just say so!"" And she stormed off--so when you recommend it always explain. Also, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price...too, much for more than just a special-occasion gift. ",2
"This is the best smelling moisturizer with an SPF that I've ever tried. It has a really nice citrusy scent, that doesn't seem artificial or obnoxious. The cream is really light, and is absorbed into my skin quickly, leaving it very soft. I usually have oily skin during the summer, and combination skin over the winter, but this cream works during all seasons. The best part is that this has SPF 15, but unlike other moisturizers that have a sunscreen after-smell (I'm very sensitive to smells) this doesn't leave any lingering scents. Terrific! ",0
"This is the best stuff I have ever used to wash my face. It even gets off mascara without giving you raccoon eyes. My face feels clean afterwards, but not stripped. I can't imagine using anything else.",1
This is the best styler I've ever invested in. I can really notice the difference in my hair. It doesn't dry out despite the abuse I give it. My curls are very natural looking as well. True believer in this line! ,1
"This is the best sugar scrub I have ever used, and I have tried a lot of them. It smoothed my skin and left it feeling moisturized. It did NOT leave my skin or tub feeling oily, which was a great. I do not enjoy sugar scrubs that leave a film or oil on my skin. The smell was yummy, lemony and sweet. This scrub has become a must have for me. ",3
"THis is the best wash was I have ever used!! I have sensiive skin that will dry out with excessive washing and this is the answer. It makes you face soo clean and literally melts away all your makeup (especially mascara). It smells grrat and leaves your face soo clean, been using it for over a year and noticed a huge improvement in my skins appearance.",1
this is the coolest eyeline. I love how since it's a powder it doesn't pull at your eye like a pencil does. I also really like how when applied dry it looks VERY natural and when applied wet it looks like a liquid liner. It elimminates the need for two different liners. ,0
"This is the finest, the most awesome palette anywhere! The lip, eye, and checck colors are full-size, long-lasting, vibrantly colored, and travel famously in a beautiful box! Possibilities for artistic creativity are endless. I love it!! ",4
This is the FIRST and ONLY eye primer I have used that has kept my eyeshadows on all day! It is a MUST in every cosmetic bag for the power of eye beauty longevity. I've used it for years and you couldn't pry it out of my makeup addicted hands. GO FOR IT! It's very economical because it WORKS!!!!! ,4
This is the first and only foundation which has brought me compliments on my skin and makeup! Imagine...I am going on 70 yrs of age and getting compliments. I still like to look my best and I use these products every day. Feels great on my skin and looks even better. I like that it is so subtle and natural and easy to apply. Love it! ,4
"This is the first brow gel that has ever held my eye brows in place! It holds like hair gel, but it doesn't clog your pores or flake. It's crunchy when it dries but that's a small price to pay to not have to smooth my brows all day long.",1
This is the first concealer I have ever used. I am not the best at mixing and matching it to find the right shade for my skin. It looks a little cakey but not too bad. I guess it's a decent concealer. ,0
"This is the first Ole HEnriksen product that I was not happy with. It didnt really do what it said it would and it made me break out for some reason, the scent is pleasant and feels nice putting it on, but i didnt really see any positive results. ",1
"This is the first primer I have tried. The primer absorbs very well. Only a little dab is needed because it spreads around so easily. I use it with the tinted moisturizer and it looks good all day at work. I work in a room with lots of natural light, so I can't wear much makeup. After 8 hrs. at work , my face doesn't look oily either. This is really a great product.",4
This is the first time I have tried this concealer for the dark shadows under my eyes (when I have little sleep or allergy problems). It is easy to dab on a tiny amount in just the right spot and then lightly blend. The color is just right for under my eyes. ,4
"This is the first time I tried NARS lipstick and I love it! I always goes for the glosses, but I wanted to try something new since I love their glosses so much. The color I got was Flair and it's such a great red for my yellow-tone skin. It last for a while too, and doesn't get everywhere either.",0
this is the first time i've tried NARS lipstick and holy cow is it creamy! doesn't feel like it's tearing up my lips when i put it on and the color lasts and lasts! love this shade for a strong mouth for evening.,2
"This is the first time that I've liked a beauty product so much that I've actually taken the trouble to review it. Years of searching for the perfect combination of creamy texture with a matte finish ended when I got this pencil as a press gift. Dragon Girl is the perfect cool red and applying it is a joy - the pencil is great for outlining and filling the lips in and the creamy texture means that you can layer it on for effect. Line the lips and blur it inwards for just a hint of colour or go all the way for a strong, sexy surge of red. I'm never going to use anything else on my lips!",0
"This is the greatest skincare / makeup find I've made on Sephora. I can't believe it didn't make the Best of Sephora this year. For 30 years I never left the house without foundation on to cover my problem skin (too oily, sensitive, enlarged pores). But since I found Supernatural, I don't ever wear foundation. It makes my aging skin look younger & more natural; less 'made up'. I love how it goes on & how it makes my skin feel. And I know I've got the SPF thing covered with no extra hassle. This has joined my mascara as the two things I can't do without. ",3
This is the lip balm I keep by my chair to use while I'm on the computer or watching TV. Now the pro and the con in my opinion. Pro: feels great when you first put it on! Con: disappears very quickly! Within 1/2 hour of applying it feels like I never put it on. ,2
"This is the longest lasting of the Philosophy fragrances (among amazing grace, pure grace and this one) on me. I spray one on each wrist, once on my neck and once in my hair, and I can smell it all day. I absolutely love this in the winter, which is right now! It's clean, and slightly sweet, with the berry note slightly warmed up, never overwhelming. People say it smells like cotton candy, but I think it has a freshness that transcends carnival food, lol! Smells natural, romantic and comforting and a bit sexy...guys do love this. I wore this last night to my friend's Christmas party, and her hubby couldn't stop sniffing me every time I walked into the room (after my hubby picked FIL for me to wear from the 2 choices I gave him) ""What is that, it's great."" "" Wow, that is so nice, mmmmm."" It's OK 'cuz we've known each other for years, but men really love this! ",3
"This is the most beautiful eye shadow I've ever found. It glides on easily, blends well, and lasts all day. Most of the rich colors are soft enough that you don't have to blend and blend to dilute the color, which is especially important when you have pale skin like mine. The shine or shimmer in some of the colors is very subtle. I have 14 of the shades already and certainly will get more. ",4
"This is the most natural look I have ever seen in brow makeup. For me a little goes a long way. Very good product. I have dark hair and medium skin tone but i really like the lighter ash shades. They look more natural on me. You have to see what color is right by trying different colors, not necessarily what the description says.",3
"This is the most perfect powder I've ever used. I'm alll about Smashbox and I love this line. Its not expensive when you consider the coverage and the lasting effect it has. No need to re-apply cause it stays till you take it off. I love the delivery system. No waste and good for my skin. My pores are smaller,also.",4
"This is the most versatile cleanser that I have ever used. When I feel like I need a deeper clean, I use a full pump, and for quick washes a quarter to half pump. There is nothing like a deep cleanse without the squeakiness which is what this product offers!",1
This is the most wonderful cleanser I have ever used. I have been using it for a few years now. The product does what it claims to do. Takes off all make up including eye make up. And it leaves my skin clean and very very soft. It is so gentle. I know that I for one will be using it forever. Have not found another cleanser that can compare to it. It is the best one out there.,4
This is the most wonderful mascara ever!!! At last a product that does exactly what it says it will do. The brush is a marvel. I just wish it was waterproof. Hope Givenchy never stops selling this product. ,4
"This is the most wonderful skin creme that I have ever used. The fresh scent, the way it goes on and how soft and smooth it keeps my always dry skin. If you are looking for something fabulous, this is it. ",4
"This is ""THE"" must have eyeshadow primer. I've purchased others but this one is the best. It makes your eyeshadow last all day and all night, it won't come off until you take it off. It can even be used alone just to smooth out your lids. ",1
"This is the one product i never like to be with out. I Use it daily. It works as a base for night time but in the day time it is my eyeshowdow. I use Lemon Aid and Babe cake eyeliner , mascara and the eye lift pencil. IF I add a little foundation, Nars blush and lipstick I am good for the day. ",4
This is the ONLY Bare Escentuals product to ever disrupt my skin. The skin above my eyelid - below the eyebrow broke out. I think eyebrow hair folicals got clogged by it. Sorry. I love Bare Escentuals but this one is a loser ,3
"This is the only eye make-up remover that does not irritate the skin around my eyes. I've used a lot of them over the years and never found one as gentle as this. However....it is so gentle that I have to use my Clarins Extra Comfort cleansing cream to get most of my eye make-up off while washing my face and then use the eye make-up remover to get the rest, otherwise I end up using a ton of the remover to get everything off. ",3
"This is the only foundation I use. Even though I have some fine lines and wrinkles it never accentuates them. There is true coverage. Powders are very light, never feeling heavy. I love the warmth and mineral veil. I look natural and younger. The brushes are top notch. Great product! ",4
This is the only foundation/tinted moisturizer that doesn't break me out! I love it. It goes on natural and keeps shine away for hours. I wish it came in a few extra shades for those times when I'm not too tan but not too light. ,0
"This is the only long-wearing lip color I've ever found that also is creamy, not sticky, and easy to remove. It truly is long lasting, and it never leaves an imprint on glasses, cups, or straws. I love the shades, but please, LORAC, make one in the new amethyst color. ",4
"This is the only makeup remover I ever use. It's lightweight and non-irritating, and you can use it all over your face or just after a face washing for removing any stubborn traces of your eye makeup. It's also not drying or oily... something I have struggled with in makeup removers in the past. One use and a friend of mine was an instant convert, too. ",1
"This is the only mascara that I wear now. It makes my lashes look fuller, thicker, and longer. I really only need to swipe it on my lashes once, unless I go out at night and really want that big, full effect! This is the best mascara I have ever used and the last mascara I will use. It is quite an amazing product!",0
"This is the ONLY mascara to use if you have thin, straight, eyelashes and you want them to stay curled after you used your eyelash curler. You can even add a second layer of mascara and they won't droop! It's amazing. ",3
This is the ONLY scent my man wears (and it is all he has ever worn in the 8 or so years we have been together) and it smells soooooo good. This is a classic fragrance that I don't ever see being replaced or discontinued. Worth every penny!!,1
"This is the ONLY shampoo for damaged hair that I have found, that doesn't make my fine, limp, color treated, damaged hair even more limp, or heavy feeling and dull looking. I just don't care for the bottle,..I try to get every drop out because this is expensive, but the dumb bottle design makes it difficult. ",3
This is the perfect beauty set for anyone who wants to look great and have beautiful skin. The moisturizer is lightweight and keeps your skin from getting dry. I really love the scent of the shampoo and body wash because it helps you feel clean and fresh. This has all the best sellers and is great for helping you look and feel pampered. ,1
this is the perfect brow brush. perfect thickness and stiffness for a notural look using powder.The spoole on thew end is nice too. I still prefer an old toothbrush though for brushing brows. nice for tavel for both.,1
"This is the perfect shade for my medium olive skin when I want to look dewy and natural. I swear it makes me look like I'm glowing. Not too much sparkle, but a fine-milled sheen. Goes on light, you can always add a touch more and not look clownish.",3
this is the perfect shampoo for thick hair that's usually really heavy and gets weighed down easily by normal to creamy conditioners. it is really light but still leaves hair feeling well-conditioned and untangles hair well. also smells fabulous ,1
This is the powder I have been hoping BE would make! Mineral Veil always looked dry and ashy on me but this powder blends right in. I love the smell and the texture...and the brush that comes with it! ,3
"This is the real deal, we were tempted to get straws! My son requested this bath gel for his last relaxing days home before college and saying goodbye to tub baths for a while. It was a terrific affordable luxury. The best part is that the fragrance is so authentic, but it doesn't linger so no one knows you soaked in rootbeer for an hour! ",4
"This is the second time I've purchased this 24K Gold lipstick. I love it, alone or over/under another lipstick. And when I get near running out of it, I'll order again!! The loose power shadow is so-so. The clutch back is nice. But the OUTSTANDING product is the lipstick! ",4
"This is the softest brush I've ever come across. When I apply my mineral makeup it feels like I'm applying it with a cloud. The bright pink case is surprisingly durable, and the cover is a great touch-you don't have to worry about it getting exposed to any bacteria or things that you don't want to touch your face! This is the best money I've ever spent on a beauty product, well worth it. ",0
"This is the ultimate in sunblock. It provides full coverage with such a flawless look, nothing like the average sunblock. I was addicted after the first application. I needed something with full coverage and SPF bc I am outdoors in extreme heat and sun for long hours. This lasts. Totally love it. ",0
"This is this best lip pencil/crayon i have ever used. It goes on smooth and creamy,it never feels dry. It's not as heavy as lipstick so it's lovely to wear, and when you want to dress it up, add alittle gloss!!!",2
"This is totally awesome and fast. Tried it and bought more, please come out with more colors. This works great and you can apply anywhere. No mess or smell. I did my nails while waiting on an airplane ride to Vegas. I even did my toe nails with this color. The color lasts long. ",3
This is totally worth the money. My other flat iron used to take a couple of minutes to heat up verses the T3 that heats up in seconds!!!We don't have the time in the morning and we know it. Perfect for days when you wake up late. Ultra sleek and shiny. You feel like a model!!!! ,0
"This is truly the perfect brow pencil. The pencil is the perfect consistency (not to hard, not too powdery) and the color is spot on perfect for my ash blonde hair and fair complexion.\nLove the brush on the other end too.",2
This is undoubtedly the best finishing powder I have ever used. It leaves a beautiful silky smooth finish and gives you a radiant look. I absolutely love it and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants that polished look.,4
This is usually in my emergency make-up bag. It works ok but not slim enough to give a straight line on my little eyes. Works well to smudge and give a smoky look. I don't use this everyday though because it doesn't work well for a day look. ,1
"This is very easy to use and the wax is nice, but I'm picky because I have very light eyebrows . The taupe is the right color, but it adds a hint of orange hue to my eyebrows that looks unnatural, especially in flourescent light. Common problem for me. ",1
This is very good where it does seem to smooth wrinkles and soften lines... I use it after I wash and moisturize my face... it has sort of a soft paste consistency with no real scent... I apply this to forehead lines and my neck.. this is the best I've found so far. ,3
"This is very sweet smelling. I purchased it with the exfoliant and the only way to describe it is honey. I'm surprised the bees don't chase me more often. I f you don't like the smell of honey, this product is not for you. ",1
"This is why samples work. I received a sample of this and loved it and I will now continue to buy it. It looks awful. Let's just say, if you've had bronchitis you'll know what I mean...green globs! However, it works great. I have oily skin and this stuff left my skin oil free for longer than any other product I've ever tried. It's sort of odd. You put it on a dry face and rub around for awhile. It turns from green to white. Then you wash it off. Fresh Face!! ",4
This is without a doubt my favorite scent ever. I am a die hard vanilla scent lover and have tried a couple of the other LAVANILLA scents but this one is by far the best. It is a very grown up beautiful vanilla scent and I find myself sniffing my wrists all day and smiling. ,3
"This is wonderful body wash. The scent is so clean and pretty, yet it fades as soon as you're out of the shower, so don't worry about smelling like the cleanser all day. If you want to smell like this all day, then you'll need the lotion and spray too. This is great for my sensitive skin. Love this.",2
"This is wonderful stuff. Multi-purpose, nicely pigmented and never irritates or dries my skin. Has a very natural finish and you can apply as much or as little as you like. Works great for travel too. ",2
This is worth the money and gives more product for what you spend. It's ultra moisturizing and smells great. My husband hates all those fruity sticky lip smackers but when he caught a whiff of this he actually tracked the scent to me. He loves it. And he doesn't even like coffee! ,2
"This is yet another product I first viewed on QVC. I wasn't sure that I would like something that smell liked sugar and that was the farest thing from the truth.....\nI always have a bottle of this is my bag. If you havent tried it, please treat yourself.",3
"this kept my skin matte and didn't bother my sensitive skin. i really have no problem other than it was a bit too dark, i prefer a more sheer color because it blends in easier. otherwise a good product! ",0
"This kit came packed with awesome sample sized bits and pieces to put together tons of looks. The lip glosses were perfect in texture and colour for ALL skin tones. The bronzer went on like heaven and the eye shadows were HOT!!! A cute, versatile grab! ",0
"This kit got me hooked on Bare Escentuals! I never used to wear make-up on my face because I have super sensitive skin and most foundations make me break out or have a crazy reaction. This is the best make-up I've ever worn, and Primetime is a must! ",0
"This kit has everything needed for brows. The stencils took me a bit to handle properly, but other than that this is very easy to use. Brows look naturally beautiful, not ""drawn on."" You won't find a better pair of tweezers than is in this set. The case is soft and beautiful, too. ",4
"This kit has everything you need to start using bare minerals foundation. I loved that it came with three brushes (which are still good and I still use them), a decent amount of two shades of foundation, and mineral veil. I didn't care for the scent and texture of the bare vitamins lotion and used the warmth sparingly. definitely a good deal if you are curious about bare escentuals makeup and haven't tried it out yet. Everyone I know is hooked! ",1
"This kit is a girl's needs in ONE package! I love the selection of colors, the packaging and the possibility to create limitless looks from one expandable pallette. I love it so much i got one for my friend. ",0
This kit is awesome for those of us not lucky enough too have be born without innate beauty skills. This kit is a great step by step how to for a perfect smoky eye. The colors are lovely and can be used for a day look or darken for a night look. The brush is also great. ,0
"This kit is just awsome how else can you try five 24/7 eyeliners. These deep jewel tones apply on so smooth and with ease, I'm off to get the VIP set. I have never been able to line my upper eyes inner rim, but I am with these. They just glide across without any problems. ",2
This kit is so worth the money. You get so many colors of everything. I can't justify buying any more shadows or lip colors because of this set. I love it so much I bought one for my mom. Way to go Sephora! ,1
This kit is the perfect size. I like that it gives you a decent amount of every product. I also like that they are small enough to take with you (aka meet airline guidelines). My skin looks lovely. I love it! ,0
"This kit was terrible. It did not help my skin at all, and it in fact made it worse. Everyone about to use this should hear this warning-the lotion contains hydrogen peroxide and WILL dye your eyebrows or any other hair on your face so beware. It made my skin worse, did not help and I would never use again. ",1
This kit will add some needed glamour to the holidays. I'm really looking forward to experimenting. I especially like the eye primer included in the kit. The eye primer has really solved a problem I was having with liner shadows. ,4
"This lash plump did absolutely nothing. It didn't even work as a regular mascara: the lash bristles were so thick and crammed that it barely touched my lashes. Even after regular usage, I saw absolutely no results. Don't waste your $. ",0
"This leaves a pretty stain on the lips and cheeks. I tried it as a blush but has to be applied 2-3 times to get enough color, but I don't like using the same brush tip for lips and cheeks, so I use a separate blush. There's still color left on lips after several hours. I would probably buy this again. ",2
"This legendary blush shade really is perfect for every skin tone and age. It flushes naturally with just a hint of glimmer. Not so much that you look like a teenager wearing glitter, just enough to highlight in a flattering way.",3
This lifts and separates...like they used to say in the old bra commercials!!! On top of that...It gives new meaning to thick and full lashes....all because I got a sample of it. A week later I rushed back to get the reg. size. ,3
"This light, fresh and citrusy scent lifts your spirits, your mood and your outlook when you add it to your daily regimen. It makes me feel ready to meet the world and be my best.....spray it all over the bed, closets, wherever I can. ",4
"This light soft fragrance gives me the air (literally) of feeling really, really clean. When I layer with the shower gel, lotion and spray fragrance I'm left with a sexy muskiness that lasts throughout the day.",3
"This lightweight formula is great for summer. The coverage is extremely sheer. The finish is natural. The formula blends easily. However the formula is slightly runny and can separate, make sure you shake the bottle before use. ",0
"This line of Bliss products smells great! Maybe because it's winter but the wonderful scent seems just right. Not too sweet, not too heavy - I'm sensitive to most of the stronger perfumes and avoid many scented products but these Bliss products are delicious. Even better, they work! ",3
"This line of products (Murad) has been around for years, but this particular product was to greasy for me. If I applied my foundations, I was shiney, almost like the product didn't absorb into my skin. I'd recommend Kinerase! ",2
"This liner is one of the best I have used to date. It can be used on its own or, as I prefer it to be used, by adding a small amount of Bare Escentuals weather everything liner sealer to the actual liner itself. This combination not only lasts until you remove it yourself but it also gives the liner a beautiful added luster. Enjoy! ",3
"This liner pencil is pretty good... most of the time it stays on very well... in warmer weather it tends to smudge a bit... after putting on the liner, I set it with eyeshadow which seems to give it more staying power... very nice assortment of colors. ",3
This lip balm has an awesome scent but it is not very moisturizing. When dipped into the bareMinerals *Warmth* face powder it makes a great natural looking lip color but doesn't have much staying power. ,2
"This lip balm is great for those benetint fans who are sick of ring around the lip and having to apply gloss/balm over their benetint, because it combines them! It's a rosy tint and moisturizing shiny balm in one, plus that great rose scent that benetint is known for. Some people who are sensitive to fragrance might find the smell overwhelming, but I totally love it. ",0
This lip gloss is amazing. The colors are great and go on really smooth and glossy. This gloss is super shiny but not sticky like some other glosses - I don't have to worry about my hair getting stuck to my lips when the wind blows. ,1
"This lipgloss is a must have! I have it with me all the time.. use it alone! for a nude pinkish shade or use it on top of your lipstick! Plus it serves as your lip gloss indicator, if the cool is still there... then you're sure to still be sexy glossy. Re-apply when the icy feel is gone! love it! love it! love it! ",0
"This lipgloss is faubulous. It has a really light flavor to it and provides lots of shine. Its not sticky either. I tried ""envy Me."" i was concerned that the color was going to be too dark. But it was nice and sheer. ",0
"This lip gloss is great. Stays on well without being too sticky. A bit shimmery for day, but great for a date or nite out with the girlz. Luv the sopisticated packaging. Only gave 4 stars because its a bit costly, but overall I do recommend it. ",2
"This lip gloss is larger than most brands, and has pretty good staying power. The colors in person are brighter and more shocking than they appear online, so buy it one shade lighter than what you actually want if you are choosing shades online. ",1
"This lip gloss is simply the best. It has a lot of color and shine and sparkle, everything I want! I have it in Coral Cabana and Traviata Pink, both great colors. I want to buy more of this gloss, it is that good. ",2
"This lip gloss is simply the best. The colors are beautiful, the shine can't be beat and it feels so good going on. It truly does make me feel prettier when I put it on. I will continue using this lip gloss as long as they continue to make it. And you get a loooooooong tube of it. Alot of product for the money. I recommend it highly. ",3
"This Lip Gloss is the best ever. Light, yet long lasting. Because it is Not sticky it is very kissable! Even my husband liked it! This shade goes with every complexion and every occasion. You can't go wrong! 5 stars! ",3
This lip pencil is easy to apply and very soft. It has staying power and gives great color to your lips without the heaviness of lipstick. I'm African American with a medium complexion and Damed gives me a nice red color but it's not too loud.,1
"This lip stain surprised me. It was not stiff, nor cakey in texture. It's very smooth and creamy. It was a little darker than I prefer, but I like the consistency so much I plan to order another one in a lighter color. I totally recommend it. ",3
"This lipstick feels very smooth, very light, applies easily, doesn't get sticky, disappear along my lipline, bleed but if I eat anything or drink anything, it wipes off. The Champagne color is a very blue-pink. ",2
This lipstick in Dolce Vita is on it's way to becoming my siganture everyday shade! It adds just the right amount of color while still looking natural. It never dries out but still manages to stay put for a long time. It almost feels more like a balm than a lipstick (but still looks like a lipstick when it's on!). Absolutely gorgeous!,1
This lipstick is absoutely amazing. The color selection is so vast and wonderful to match almost anything. Its very creamy and long lasting. I love this product. I have recommended this to several friends and they are hooked as I am.,2
"This lipstick is a pretty red, but it goes on very heavily. I most definitely have to blot my lips several times to tone down the color. It looks good with my medium skin and very dark hair, but it would be great for darker skin because it is so intense. ",2
"This lipstick is creamy and moist, gives full coverage and stays on. It is very long wearing, the color stays true and there is no beedling outside the lipline. I love 631 and 752. I also look forward to the addition of more shades. These are worth the money. ",4
"This little blush does a wonderful job of establishing sheer, subtle, long-lasting color. I like that it has some sparkle but not too much for we women who are no longer kids. The color of the product is also very close to it's representation online which is wonderful for actually receiving what you believe you're ordering. Thanks, Sephora, for putting the apples in my cheeks! ",4
"This little box is AWESOME!! After trying many different bronzers, I found this one in 2002 & ihave used it since then. The color is perfect on any skin tone. I am usually fair/med complected, but in the TX summers I get very tan. HOOLA gives a natural ""fresh tanned look"" without the over shiny ""faux"" look. ",1
"This little brush places a soft, not harsh, line of eyeliner along the lash line. I love using wide eyeliner brushes instead of the traditional tiny ones with only a few hairs. These wide brushes make controlling the eyeliner application so much easier. I have all the the BE brushes and, believe me, they are worth every penny. ",4
This little palette made me very happy! Bought a second one the day after my first because the colors are very pretty and I was afraid they would sell out. There is not one color that does not look good on me and I can see getting tons of use out of this perfect little traveling case. ,3
This little pink machine is the best. I look forward to the mini massage every night. My skin looks great since I have been using it. My mom accused my of having some mini work done!! Love love love it! ,3
This little refillable portable powder case has been all over the world. I always keep one in my travel bag. Not only is it perfect for loose powder but for those using mineral podwer products as well ,4
"This little ""stick"" is a great concealer plus zit zapper. I get small breakouts on my nose and this product works very well in drying them out. I use it day and night as needed. Also, the formula is creamy and works well as a concealer while zapping the blemishes. It can be used with foundation; does not cake of flake. ",3
"This little trimmer is great. I think the reason it works so well is its diminutive size. The epilator is more effective and removes hair more painlessly than any other epilator I have ever used. It is small ,but so is the area it was designed to work on. The micro razor worked exactly as promised and did not pull. Bliss provides the best hair removal products for home use. ",3
"This looked so beautiful in the palatte - I got the Rose Boise 460- two rose pinks, one a shimmer, one matte, a shimmer beige and matte brown - but when I put them on, they looked dead on me- I thought there would be more warmth from the pinks and warm amber color, but they were unlike what they looked in the palatte. I wanted to like these, but I didn't find the pigment especially dense. I was disappointed, expected more from Guerlain. It was not worth the price, so I sent it back. ",3
This lotion hydrates my skin beautifully without adding to my oiliness. Surface dryness around my mouth and under my nose disappears. It works very well as a base for my foundation. I am considering trying the Cream formula when the weather gets cold and dryer. ,4
"This lotion is fast-absorbing, very hydrating, and smells good. A little goes a long way. I recommend buying a couple of these at once since because of the small container you do go through it pretty fast if you use lotion as often as I do! ",0
"This lotion is my splurge of all splurges! No matter how I'm feeling, when I put this on I always feel better! Its funny because I didn't even like the smell when I first used it. Now I love it and try not to ever be without it!",1
"This lotion not only protects my skin from the sun, it's had a wonderful effect on a couple dark ""sun spots"". One cannot be seen and the other is light enough to be masked by powder. Love this product! ",2
"this lotion smells good, not so sure about the firming. i couldn't really tell that it firmed my skin, but the scent lasted a while through the day. it does last longer than body butters because it is a thinner lotion which i like better. left my skin feeling soft after a shower. it is worth trying. i really like philosophy products.",1
"This lotion went on smoothly and left my skin feeling moisterized without feeling greasy. Although the scent was a bit too strong when first applied to the skin, it quickly faded to a lovely chocolatey odor only recognizable when someone is within an inch of me. ",4
this makes for a tight look to keep everything up and in place. it can get a bit clumpy or crusty if it is applied too thick but brushed through and then left untouched through the day my brows look so much cleaner than with no product.,1
"This makes your skin so, so smooth. Your foundation will just glide on with minimal effort and no caking. It makes your makeup last all day, through wind and weather. Not to mention the flawless finish it provides.",0
This makeup is the best I have purchased so far. It goes on smoothly and very lightly so that you cannot tell or feel that you are wearing any makeup at all. It lasts all day and I am very pleased with this product. Will definitely purchase again. ,4
this makeup was alright. i thought shell which is shade #3 was too light on my moderately fair skin. plus the size is a bit too small considering the price. overall i thought that there is nothing special about this makeup. ,0
This mascara definitely is waterproof. It even stays if you shed some tears. It does however seem to be a bit clummpy and I am not sure if it will dry up too quickly. I do like the product though and plan on buying it again as it does not smear under the eye but difficult to get off if you mess up.,4
"This mascara didn't live up to my expectations for volume, lenghtening or being waterproof. However it does seem to make your eye lashes healthier over time, fuller & softer. If you have great lashes anyway, but need color & conditioning it would be perfect. The brush also it to thick/full to separate lashes well. ",3
"This mascara does it all. I tried all the other #1 favorites-- Bad Gal Lash, Dior, Laura Mercier, Fresh-- but this one did it for me. It really pumped up the volume and lengthened at the same time. No clumps, no flakes, no whimpy lashes.",1
"This mascara does not clump, which is good, but that's it. I don't know what all the hype was - nothing different, nothing full or fluffy. It did not do anything different for me than any other mascara. I was really disappointed. ",3
This mascara does such a great job a curler isn't even necessary. The big brush combined with the excellent product itself provides length and natual curl unmatched by any other product I've ever tried. It opens the eyes right up and is so fantastic it's all I need in my makeup case.,0
"This mascara goes on with simply NO CLUMPS. It is a drier mascara and leaves the lashes colored and seperate. It doesn't thicken or lengthen longer than what your lashes naturally are, but it is great for me. ",3
"This mascara go's on smooth, does not flake all day, and makes your eyelash's full and long Subtle Color compliments eye color, and it does not irritate my eyes like other Mascara has, and i have tried many ! ",3
This mascara has a lot of fibers which do tend to flake when they dry and don't always go on your lashes smoothly. My other complaint about this mascara is that the texture is very wet and slippery so it's hard to apply multiple coats and tends to give your lashes a spiky clumped effect. I was pretty disappointed. ,0
"This mascara has it all - it gives you the most out of even the most anemic of lashes: biig volume & length for miles! It even layers well, if you want to reapply before a night out! Plus: it never, ever clumps!! ",2
"This mascara has the best staying power ever. It lengthens and curls in one stroke but if you use more than a coat, do it before the first ones dry or you will definitely get clumps. This mascara is hard to remove if you do not use lots and lots of water. I find that makeup remover doesn't work on it at all. Use lots of water or risk pulling your lashes off! ",0
"This Mascara is absolutely without a doubt the best Mascara ever invented. Believe me when I tell you there is NO mascara I have not tried, and I have a few favorites until now. This is the BEST Ever!!!! Buy it you will not be dissappointed.",4
"This mascara is actually about what I expected. Not a miracle, but not bad either. It wasn't very dramatic, but it did lengthen and separate quite well, but nothing that I haven't experienced before from other brands. I can see myself grabbing this every once in awhile, but not everyday. I didn't experience any flaking, clumping, or smudging, which is a fantastic quality in a mascara. This product just doesn't really seem to make too much of an impact, positive or negative, pretty forgettable.",0
This mascara is amazing. I am many times asked if I am wearing fake eyelashes when I wear this mascara. This is the kind of mascara that makes you look awake when you're not! It doesn't clump or make eyelashes stiff and break off. It is all around amazing!,0
"This mascara is a waste of money. It doesn't lenghten or separate, and takes alot of coats to even get any kind of build up at all. It is difficult to find a good mascara ( I have tried an extreme amount over the years), so trust me when I say this is not one of the good ones. ",2
"This mascara is awesome! I always get great coverage with the little brush to all my eyelashes! It gives nice, full lashes without it being too brittle or hard. I wear to work or out with the girls! The little brush makes it easier to get around to all those little lashes and the bottom lashes too. ",0
"This mascara is awesome in every way. It conditions the lashes, lengthens and holds curl. It does not smudge or flake, and to top it all off, it is all natural and eco friendly!! Good Stuff, quality products, Tarte! ",1
this mascara is brilliant i put it on and my lashes look thicker and longer i usually buy only black mascara but the brown was georgous so i had to get it i recomended this to another friend and they also loved it i wish it came in fun colors too ,0
"This mascara is fine, but I wouldn't say it's anything special. It doesn't lengthen or plump any more than any other mascara I've tried, especially at this price. Also, the big brush is somewhat of a turn-off, because it doesn't separate lashes very well. ",0
"This mascara is great! It is exactly as described!! It makes my lashes long, full and feathery without clumping! The product seemed to be a little pricey, but the tube is HUGE! I love this product and I will purchase it again for sure! ",1
"this mascara is just great. the brush allows you to get it on all yur lashes. if your an on the go girl, i reccomend buying the small one. Just put it in your purse and your ready to go. great product.",1
this mascara is made for short lashes and I have long lashes.. I do like mine to look longer but the fibers hung off my lashes at the ends weird... too thin and not in the direction of the lash... i had a bad experience with this. ,0
"This mascara isn't very intense, even though it is black, but it IS very build-able. After a couple of coats, I like to add a few extra coats to create more BANG. I love that it is natural, though.... so the little extra work is fine. ",1
"This mascara is okay for regular coverage. However, I do not think it it does anything special. It claims to curl eyelashes, but I did not see a difference at all. The brush does separate lashes well, but it does not add any volume or length. One positive aspect is that it washes off very easily. ",1
"This mascara is outstanding! This odd little brush gets to every lash, short or long and extends them beautifully. Because it is small, you can get right in the corners which makes a very full lash, from corner to corner. Great Stuff - I won't do without this one. ",3
"This mascara is phenomenal! It is perfect for every day use but, as someone stated earlier, it only takes an additional coat or 2 to completely vamp it up. My friend claims it gives her ""Betty Boop eyelashes."" It doesn't rub off or flake. It did clump once, a tiny bit, but that was only because i didn't screw the top on all the way.",1
This mascara is really nice. Your lashes are black as night and super full. Perfect for smoky going-out eyes. My only problem is that the brush is so big that I always get some on my lids. I'm probably just a klutz though. No flaking throughout the night either. ,0
This mascara is simply amazing!! It doesn't flake or crumble - even if you accidentally fall asleep with it still on. I'm a sucker for long thick lashes and this definitely delivers - my lashes even hit my brow bone with this stuff on! ,1
"This mascara is the best mascara I have ever used - I too am a mascara junkie. Or I should say, I was until I found this stuff!! It goes on amazingly, does not clump, does not flake and lasts all day. It is truly the best one out there!",1
"This mascara is way too clumpy! If i applied one coat I didnt get enough volume, so I tried to put on more coats but it just got all clumpy, cakey, dry looking and weird. Would not buy this mascara again or recommend this to anyone. It also had this weird floral smell :( ",0
This mascara made my lashes visibly longer and fuller. I loved the feel of it as well because this mascara made my lashes feel very natural and never weighed down or hard. This mascara does flake a little but but not enough for me to not buy this product again! Great job Fresh! ,0
This mascara makes my eyelashes luxurious and full. I apply to the ends of my top eyelashes and it makes my eyes so much bigger. I also apply it to me lower lashes and it actually makes me look like i am wearing false eyelashes. I love this product. ,0
"this mascara really seems to be hit or miss... put me down for the miss column.. on the initial application it was ridiculously clumpy, so i thought id try to dilute it a little with water... after doing so the application was much easier but the results were nothing to rave about.. there are some drugstore brands that do a better job at volumizing... it gets a decent score when it comes to holding a curl but thats about it.. takes way too much effort with a lash comb to get your lashes not to look spidery.. and its so incredibly difficult to remove.. even when using a cleanser that removes waterproof mascara with no problems, i was having trouble getting it off... it dries like liquid latex on your lashes... will not be repurchasing ",1
"This mascara rocks my world. I've been using the black Bad Gal mascara for a few years now, so when I saw the Plum, I wanted to try it. I wasn't expecting anything as awesome as this mascara is! It's WONDERFUL. The big wand gives nice volume as well as length, and the quality of the mascara is great, as is everything benefit makes. I have blue-green eyes, and the plum color sets them off nicely, while looking natural and yet interesting. I have fair skin, and sometimes black mascara looks too harsh on me; this plum color is like using a brown mascara (i.e., it looks natural), but even better! The only downside is that it's really not waterproof. I don't like waterproof mascara, so that doesn't bother me, but this product is even less waterproof than other mascaras, if that makes sense. Any hint of moisutre, and there's purple streaks running down my face. So, be warned. But, even with that as a downside, I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have light eyes and warm skin - although, I think it would look stunning with brown eyes, too. You should get it. It's AWESOME. ",1
"This mascara was voted Best of Sephora several times already, so I decided to give it a try. It was like any other mascara to me. I have asian eyes and asian eye lashes which are freakishly straight and thin. This mascara works better if you have some type of primer to go along wtih it. Other than that, it is not that great..and yes it does clump. You do need to swipe it a few times if you want that volumized look and it can get messy. ",0
"This mascara works pretty well. I use it with the CLS booster. I have noticed though, that a lot of mascara tends to sit on the brush between the bristles, and the result is my lashes clumping. I have to use a clean mascara brush to separate my lashes after applying this mascara. My main goal is length, so I prefer the L'EXTREME formula. Lengthens without clumping.",0
This mask is wonderful in soothing you skin. Great for normal to dry complexions. Has a great coverage and it doesn't peel off if you apply it in a smaller quantity. I am comparing it to a Lancome Hydra Intense mask which has this inconvenient. I love Dior products and this mask is one of my favorites! ,2
This mask was like magic! My skin was glowing and I recieved so many compliments. It made my skin dewy and gave an amazing glow that showed through my makeup. This was only after using it once! I think I prefer this over salon facials! ,0
"This matte bronzer is my favorite so far~~~~~the powder is very fine, so it blends easily with anything. The color is very flattering on my light skin. It sculpts my face without shimmer or glitter, so it looks totally natural on my face. Highly recommended product! Try it! ",0
"This may be better suited for the tweens (like my daughter who absolutely loves it), but I wear it and love it too. It reminds me of cotton candy. I have the lotion too and it has the exact same pleasant sugary smell (some lotions smell different than their perfume counterparts). It's very affordable too!",1
"This may be more money than the clear ones in the drugstores but it is well worth the money. The elastic is strong and really keeps your hair (even on the neckline) in the shower. With it's double covering, it drys fast and no water gets through. Not to mention...you look cute in front of your love interest!! ",2
"This Metallic pocket Brush Set from Sephora is just the right size and has a good selection of brushes for the younger crowd. I purchased these for grand daughters who are receiving a makeup kit that has no brushes included. Nice price, good brushes, just the right size! ",4
"This Mineral Veil was introduced to me by my daughter this past summer. It is so key now to my finishing touches when wearing make up. The light, non visible application keeps that oily look from showing up. I love it and now would not go without it. AND the product seems to last forever...very worth the money!",4
"This moisturizer absolutely lives up to its reputation. It is the perfect consistency and does not make your skin feel oily. It is great under foundation, too. It does take a few minutes to dry, but once it does your foundation will go on beautifully.",0
"This moisturizer does hydrate your skin well, but doesn't absorb into your skin very well. Had to wait at least 10 minutes after application to apply makeup. Probably best for dry, sensitive skin rather than normal skin.",1
"This moisturizer, for the value, is just awesome! It makes your face feel so smooth and soft!! This is the BEST I have tried for the price. It really quenches thirsy, dry skin, and soaks right into your face, and you know it is moisturizing!! Dosen't have any retinol, do it dosent reverse any fine lines, but can be used sparingly on any part of the body. I have found with this product, a little goes a LONG way too! ",3
"This moisturizer is the one that I have found most closely matches its perfume scent. This smells exactly like Amazing Grace perfume, which I absolutely love. The lotion is creamy and moisturizing. However, it never feels greasy, and it sinks in fast. As for the firming attributes, I honestly can't tell. My skin does feel smoother, though.",1
"This moisturizer is the only one I've used that moisturizes where you need moisture and leaves a matte finish in the T-Zone oily area, the matte finish it provides lasts me all day, I'm not shining at all, if it takes away my shiny T Zone it will work for anyone. It has a light clean completely natural fragrance that I like as well. For my skin it also keeps it clear so I could literally just stop buying the expensive spot treatment I was using. You must try it.",0
"This moisturizing (but not oily) foundation gave my dry skin a luminous glow. It ""erased"" fine lines and the creamy texture allows buildable coverage where needed. I would defind coverage as moderate to full... but it does not seep into lines. The shade range is natural and the ""Warm Ivory"" gave the ""Illusion"" of perfection to my fair skin. ",4
"This mosturizer doesn't feel too mosturizing. Seems like my skin is not absorbing it. I bought this mainly because it has ""best of sephora"" on it. The lotion feels funny, it doesn't feel like a lotion texture at all.",1
This mult-purpose product smelled good but the container was almost too big around to hold and took up too much room on my small shower rack. It does lather up good but I think it's hyped too much because of the brand name. I probably won't buy again. ,4
"This neutral palette was just what I was looking for. I use my own brushes, not the applicator included. I highly recommend using your own brushes. I also recommend using an eye primer. The colors spread better on a primer base, not so good on bare skin. ",3
"This new foamy cleanser cleanses well. I had high hopes for it as I DO prefer a foamy cleanser to a creamy one, but I was sort of let down with this one, but only for the fact, compared to original purity which I do love......... you have to use so much of it to keep it foamy for the minute of massage to make it work well, I didn't feel it lasted near long enough. Cleans well, leaves skin feeling ok & would recommend it over tons of other things, but NOT over original purity. ",3
this one smudged on me really bad...even when i don't put any mascara on the bottom lashes i still get smudges! it brought volume and length but too messy for me. althou my sister fell in love with it! ,0
"This palette certainly looks nice, but I was kind of disappointed with it. Several people have already said this, but I can't help but emphasize: it is VERY small. I bought it mostly because of the clutch, it looks really cool on the site, but it is a little on the ""cheap side"" indeed. Now I must say this has a HUGE mirror inside which is the full size of the clutch, very nice. The eyeshadow colors are great, the lip gloss too, and I really really liked the mascara (I will definitely buy the full-sized version after trying this!). The compact powder is the downside. Very small, and there's no way you can use the colors separately. In short there's no way I would have paid 50 dollars for this... 35 is okay being that it is, after all, a Givenchy product. ",0
"This palette has amazing colors for fall! Everything you need in one handy palette at an amazing price. This is great for travel, and great for home use. The shadows dont crease and go on evenly. Highly recommended! ",0
"This palette has the most flattering shade of pink eyeshadow and includes both plain and frosted shades. They glide on like silk, look amazing, and stay on all day. I also noticed that my eyeliner goes on better over them. Love, love, love this palette and want to try the other set that has different colors in it. The little compact is easy to stow and use and comes with its own applicator. ",4
"This palette is awesome! The colors blend very well and have truly insane color pay-out, which I love. I put this on and my husband raved about how good it looked. The blues really make my eyes pop. Keep it up, Kat! ",0
"This palette is fantastic. It comes compact, yet durable. It has 3 ""looks"" and an instruction card for application. The shadow doesn't irritate my eyes. I always have wanted to master that Smoky look, with this, you can't go wrong! It's worth every penny. I do wish it came with a mirror, this is so easy to pack along all day and touch up when necessary.. I love my Smokey Palette and won't leave without it! ",2
"This palette is great! The eyeshadows, cream and powder, are wonderful and last all day with no creasing. I don't even have to use primer. The lip colors are dry as others have said, but i just put a balm over it and it looks great. The brushes are flimsy-looking, but I always use my pro brushes, anyway. You can't beat it for that low price! ",0
"This palette is pretty freakin' awesome. I love Cargo's product and this is a great gift to give to someone that has never tried them before. Best of all, it's much larger in person than one would expect. ",0
"This palette is small in stature, but large in performance. The 3 different looks are very easy to achieve and the flash cards are easy to follow. The applicators that come with the palette aren't the best, so I used my own and had no problems getting the perfect smoky eye. It's a great starter kit. ",2
"This particular product has had numerous ratings and winnings over the past several years in multiple magazines. I opted to purchase and was unbelievably surprised. The color is absolutely gorgeous and provides a natural blush look. The color ""Blush"" fits the product appropriately. I don't feel it's the precise color for fall or winter, but come spring and summer, it has my vote. You could tone this particular color with another if it blends well and gives that glow without an overwhelming affect.",4
This peel is exactly what it advertises. Skin is bright and renewed even after just one use. I've been using it 2 times a week and can tell a huge difference. I'd definitely reccommend it to friends. I was looking for something to use with my cellex-c regimen and this fits the bill for that little extra boost. ,3
"this pencil adds just a touch of shiny glam to your look. used as a liner, it's great for very fair skins as a sparkly, sheer look without heaviness or being obvious. if you have a deeper skin tone, these liners will definitely give your eyes a nice 'pop' of color. these pencils are a nice alternative for someone who wants a lined-eye look, but without the heaviness of a matte pencil. I like that the sparkle is minimal [but still visible] so you can rock your look a little even by day. they blend well together, too. they do tend to smudge a bit, but as they are rather sheer, this isn't a bad thing. very nice product. ",2
This pencil is great because it's soft and therefore very versatile. I find it a little too soft however for the bottom lid of my eye and I'm constantly hitting the wood part of the pencil. It is great however for the eye lid to create a smokey look. ,0
"This pencil is great for a sexy, smokey, smudged eye. Don't get fooled by the word pencil though - this is a thick pencil - more like a crayon. If you are looking for a precise eye-liner this is NOT the product for you. However, if you want an easy, sexy, smokey eye, this is the product for you! ",1
"This perfume has a very unique, ethereal scent. It's sweet and kind of mysterious at the same time. I can't pinpoint it, but there is a note or a combination of notes that makes it smell like no other perfume. It's very girly. ",0
"This perfume is AWESOME!!! Everytime I wear it, all I get are compliments about how good it smells...I like it because it's light, but it's strong and lasts all day....Very soft and subtle....THE BEST!!!!",2
"This perfume is one of my all-time favorites. It's almost impossible not to love the scent. It's not to sweet, citrusy, woody, or anything. Everything is perfectly balanced. I whole-heartedly recommend it.",0
"this perfume is so clean & refreshing! i recieved the trendsetters scent sampler for christmas, and this one stood out to me. i usually go for more warm & vanilla toned scents like burberry brit and viva la juicy. this is definately something thats not the norm for me, but i really adore it ",0
"This perfume is truely truely euphoric. I came upon it when my mom, sisters and i were at dinner and our waitress was wearing this. I begged my mom to ask her what she was wearing. I described it by saying that the scent was almost ""hypnotizing"" me. which was definiately weired when we found out it was called euphoria. i love it.",0
"This perfumes description is so beautifully true. I really love this perfume. I have used this scent for years, i'm a fragrance lover and i always have different scents in my vanity because i like to play with different scents according to my mood. J'Adore has always been one of my favorites ever since i took my first whiff.",2
"This perfume smells AMAZING. The first time I sprayed it on, I was unsure. My instant first impression was that it smells like every other crisp and clean floral scent. But nooo. After it sits on your skin for a half an hour or so, it develops a very unique and fresh scent. I love it! I bought the $20 travel bottle and when that runs out, I will definitely buy the larger size. I also like to combine it with Philosophy's Amazing Grace when I'm hanging around he house with my boyfriend, to tone down the freshness and add a little musk. They smell surprisingly delicious together!",0
"This perfume smells really good, but it is also really strong!! I bought this years ago and the scent was so overpoweringly strong that I stopped wearing it. It sat on my dresser for a few years and now it is perfect. I love the spicy smell! ",2
"this pink palette is good to use all year around with anything. I have brown hair and blue eyes. Pink looks perfect no matter what I have on. And it's not just pink, because you have gold beige and nice brown in it too. I absolutely love creamy eyeliner and brush with it. It's so easy to use. Love it ",1
"This plumper hold it's own in comparison to any popular brand, apply it first thing, before makeup and use the wand to massage and keep applying more product until every square inch of lip has been ""awakened"" and massaged to full plump! The extra stimulation really adds to the ""plump"", don't forget the top lip! ",2
"This ""plumping"" glaze is just as sticky and drying as the regular lip glaze. The click pen is so annoying too since you can't get the right amount out, then you have a mess. I didn't notice any plumping effects, but maybe I was too busy feel annoyed that my lips were sticking together. Stila's lip glaze stick is awesome, but apparently anything with a click and a brush is sticky. ",1
"This polish is fun and easy. It is so great that every thing is in one place. On one side you have the white color. The other side is the top coat. I like it because it is a little edgey,but not over the top ",3
"This powder blush is the best powder that I've tried. The blush provides sheer coverage; it is easy to blend and gives you a subtle glow. If you want a bolder blush look, it can easily be layered, with more applications, to darken the color to your liking.",1
"This powder is great for absorbing the oiliness I get underneath my hair the second day after a washing. It is white, so it might be a little more difficult to blend into dark hair without it being noticeable. My hair's blonde, so I haven't had a problem with this unless I get heavy-handed during application. I would like to see it in an unscented version because I get kind of tired of the lemony smell after a while. ",1
"This primer does exactly what the description tells you it does...it creates a perfect canvas for foundation application...and best of all, it doesn't make me break out. Also, a little bit goes a long way. Love it!",0
"This primer is just.... wow. Awesome. I have been using this for a year or so and I see myself continuing to use this in the years to come. Just love this product. Keeps my face oil-free and gives a matte finish. I don't even have to touch up my make up or reapply since it keeps my foundation, blush/bronzer intact. It also smooths out your face and reduces the visibility of pores. A highly recommended product. Give it a try!",0
"This primer is the best I've found to intensify color and make it last all day without creasing. I don't really like the wand, so I use a flat concealer brush to spread it over my lid. Don't put on eyeshadow without it! You'll use less eyeshadow with better color. ",0
"This primer made my face pore-free but after using it several days in a row, I noticed a few small pimples. I am out of the break-out stage and believe the break-out was caused from this primer. I still use this product, just not every day.",2
"This primer potion is absolutely amazing! I recommend it to everyone. I've used it for years now so I know it works. I work 12 hour night shifts. Recently, after working my shift, I had a busy day and was awake for 30 hrs by the time I got to go to bed. When I went to remove my makeup, I was amazed to see that my eyeshadow had not budged, faded or creased even after 30 hours. This stuff should be called Magic Potion. ",3
"This primer will virtually give you a new canvas to apply your foundation to. Your skin imperfections and large pores disappear as you apply this primer. Followed with your foundation...Bare Escentuals minerals is definitely my preference.............your pores and imperfections are no where to be seen. Trust me, I have tried every primer on the market, and Photo Finish is the BOMB. The secret is to let it dry for 3 to 4 minutes before applying any make-up. Your face will be totally smooth and make-up will not sit in pores and lines any more. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!",4
"This product absolutely gives your face the finishing touch. Your eyes will just pop out after it is applied. It is best used before you apply cheek color. If you look tired at the end of the day, just apply and you will look so refreshed. Yes, that is why it is a SECRET brightening powder!!!",4
This product absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy residue like the hope in a tube. I can't give it 4 stars because I can't use it twice a day without it drying and flaking the skin on the outer corners of my eyes (probably due to reaction with moisturizer hope in a bottle). It does leave the eye area smooth as silk. ,1
"This product adds a subtle, shimmery tone to my skin. It looks fresh and natural but not ordinary. Perfect for days and evenings. It keeps my friends wondering what I've done differently that makes me look refreshed! ",3
"This product a great value and it serves so many functions! My favorite thing to use it on is my eyebrows. As someone who doesnt have straight hair, I find my eyebrows dont always want to stay in place. This holds them there all day. Although I do use a different mascara on my top lashes, I use this on my bottoms lashes because I can get definition without getting black make-up all over my bottom lid throughout the day. I love the brush because it really allows you to use it for its many purposes. And! Its very affordable. ",0
"This product does a good job of moisturizing and gently scenting dry skin. I use it when I need the moisture and not so much fragrance. However, it is more floral than the woody oriental eau de parfum; maybe it is more like the voile de parfum.",4
This product does all it promises and more...I have oily skin and my regular moisturizer can sometimes leave dry patches which my foundation picks up on. Photo Finish leaves my face with a smooth and fawless base so my foundation goes on prfectly. Love this product!,3
"This product does brighten my skin and help fade age spots. The only drawback is that I can't use it under my make-up because it tends to flake when combined with other products. It's great to use at night, however. ",3
"This product does everything it claims and more! I've been using it for years, and never has it failed me. It keeps my makeup from sliding off my face [even here in the desert] and helps keep my skin soft since it hekps lock in my moisturizer. I definitely recommend the green tinted one if you've got ruddy skin or have a tendency to break out.",0
This product does exactly as the description says...it plumps & lifts my baby fine color-treated hair without weighing it down. I have found all Ojon products to be exceptional. I will always be a devoted customer to Ojon (and Sephora!). ,3
This product does not cover very good. It is greasy and VERY EXPENSIVE. I may return this item. I was very disappointed after trying this because all the reviews were very positive. It does not blend well... ,3
This product does not stay on my lips and it is drying my lips out and is just okay on my cheeks. The first time I used it I had to turn it 38 times before anything came out . I counted ! I don't like the fact that you can't tell how much is in the tube. I have cheaper products that do better. ,4
"This product does seem to be helping the ""aging"" aspects of my face. But, it has dried out my skin something awful! I decided to use only a few times a week at bedtime rather than every night. I am using a heavy duty moisturizer on the alternate nights. ",3
"This product does TRIPLE duty. Not only is it great for brows, but I also use it to line my eyes. The stiff brush makes it effortless. Here's where the triple duty comes in. I also use the Brow Powder duo as an eyeshadow! I use the deeper shade in the crease and the lighter on the lid. My eyes pop when I use the product in the 3 ways I described. People I work with say I look refreshed. I believe by keeping the colors uniform between the brows, liner and shadow helps with keeping the ""natural"" look. A fantastic product!!!",3
This product flatters your skin without looking fake or too sparkly like other bronzers. This enhances your natural skin tone and evens out your complexion. Very lightweight and silky feeling. I love the way this product makes me look and it feels like you're wearing nothing! It's the best! ,2
This product gets your face clean and it feels smooth after using. Does not leave it dry. Easy to use pump gives you just the right amount. I've tried lots of facial cleansers and this is one of the best. ,4
This product has it all! High sunscreen protection plus all the anti-aging properties needed for the Florida sun. AND it is absorbed quickly and is non-greasy. Just perfect. I play golf and this is the best product I have found to give me the protection I need. ,4
"This product helped me fill in and define my eyebrows very easily and quickly. With the two shades provided you can blend until you get your perfect color. Once set, this stuff was really long lasting and the perfect brows made my eyes look beautiful!",1
"This product is absolutely amazing! I usually use Estee Lauder, but like others decided to try it for the unique wand. Boy does it deliver. It's like you're painting each eyelash one by one. You have absolute control over the application, and your eyes don't tear as much because you can close them as you're putting the mascara on. I think this will be my only mascara from now on, I just hope they come out with more colors. ",2
"This product is a classic. I first started using it in middle school, stopped using it in college, but recently went back to it in my mid-twenties. It's lightweight, moisturizing, and doesn't clog my pores. I wouldn't recommend it for mature skin, but it's perfect for people in their teens and twenties (and my mother used it during her thirties before switching to something heavier in her forties). ",1
"This product is a godsent. For the busy bees out there that don't have the time to wash your hair after a day at work or an afternoon at the gym, this is the dry shampoo you need. I, myself, always wash my hair in the morning before work and just do not wish to wash my hair a second time after the gym after work. So I can just take a quick shower and spray it on my hair and the oil disappears. Great between wash! Although, the only one thing I don't like with it is that you definitely have to be in an open area. The spray and smell is a little bit overwhelming if you stay in small and close quarters. But not a deal-breaker at all! Have fun shopping ladies! :) ",1
"This product is amazing. Despite getting my brows waxed on a regular basis, one brow likes to move out of place throughout the day. With this product my brows do not budge despite my side-swiped bangs hitting them. I have previously used wax and drugstore clear mascara, but there is no comparison, this product is far superior, produces a more natural look, and worth the price. I use only a very light amount of the product and do not experience any of the flakiness that others have commented on.",1
"This product is amazing! I use it every morning just to feel that bubbly, breath of fresh air on my face. It not only feels wonderful, but it actually does what it says it does! It has made my skin look younger and brighter. It's a product I can't live without! ",3
"This product is awesome! Growing back over plucked eyebrows isn't easy. And I'm not talking just a one time accident, I'm talkin a year of having the skinniest eyebrows imaginable! Last year, I started to to try to grow my eyebrows in and after a few months of waiting and waiting and just growing literally three long hairs under my brow, I stumbled upon this product! No, I didnt put it on and have beautiful brows a month later but after six months of strange looking hairy regrowth, I had good eyebrows but there was still some tiny areas where there was some hairs missing so I continued to use this product over this past year and now I have amazing eyebrows that I always receive compliments on! It took a long time and about six months of no plucking but it was so worth the results! I reccomended this product to my own sister and I also reccomend it to anyone looking for great brows! But remember, It takes time! So worth the money! and even worth the time! Enjoy it ladies! ",0
"This product is awesome, i can't wait to own every color! For onoce the name fits the product, it really just glides on effortlessly! The colors are so vibrant, and the best part is it stays on! Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencils are really wat they say they are!",0
"This product is awesome! I have thick hair and after washing it, my hair tends to get very frizzy. I finally found something that controls it beautifully. Don't use too much because your hair gets greasy. ",1
"This product is awesome. My skin glows immediately after using this. I mix it in the philosophy firming serum. Also, try mixing it in you firming body lotion, it helps with any aging spots. Amazing can't live without. Thanks Philosophy.",3
"This product is awesome, super bonus that it smells really good. Works best to use a few times a week, to exfoliate. You don't need to use that much of it so the tube lasts a long time. If you have sensitive skin it's a great product, because it's not harsh. ",1
this product is easy to use and curls my lashes perfectly. i usually am in hurry in the morning and have few min to do makeup. i curl my lashes first with this and it only takes 2 seconds.. can't live without it ,1
This product is easy to use. Just a little goes a long way and I love the fact it has a sheer bronze tint to it. It's lightweight and protects your skin too. Not oily but moisturizes. Helps your foundation glide on and keeps it in place better. What more could you ask for? ,3
"This product is easy to use, smells like lemons, and is great for in between washes. I have used the spray and didnt like it as much as the dry product. Make sure you blended it in completely with your hair!! ",1
"This product is excellent! When my lips become dry and cracked in the winter, I put this on before I go to bed and in the morning they look and feel moisturized. I do notice fine lines erased on and around my lips when I use this. This product does everything it says it should. I highly recommend it. ",3
"This product is extra simmery and the color is lovely.... But it requires extra blending either by finger or cotton swab to properly blend. Contact lens wearers beware - later in the day, shadow will flake into lenses causing serious irritation. ",2
"This product is fabulous! I don't know how they do it, but before I came across Purity Made Simple, my facial cleansing process consisted of at least three different products before I felt like I got all the makeup and daily grime off. Now, after using this face wash, my skin feels smooth, clean, and unclogged with just one step! I should had, that I do follow it with the On A Clear Day face wash for acne treatment, but otherwise I would not need it. Great product!",0
"this product is fantastically popular. it did nothing but sit on the surface of my skin in a dense, oily layer. apparently, I am in the minority, as it works for lots of other people. I would not buy this again. ",2
"This product is fantastic! I'm a 58 yrs.female and I was looking for a cleanser to reduce my pore size. In the description of this product it explains that is what it does AND it deep cleansand removes all make-up.too. It holds up to it's advertising,! but only use a very small amount on a wet face,it really lathers up fast.I needed a wash cloth to get it off,and then rinsed with clear warm water. And then onto his firming facial cleanser-go to that review-you won't be sorry!!",4
"this product is good and definitely absorbs the oil in ""second-day"" hair. be forewarned: a little goes a long way, so use sparingly. it has a nice, pleasant lemon scent and does it's job. what else do you need in a dry shampoo? ",1
This product is great because it has the conditioning aspect which has made my lashes visibly healthier and keeps them from falling out! When you use mascara everyday it takes a toll on lashes and this mascara eliminates the problems before they start! Highly recommended!!,0
This product is great for anyone who needs to add moisture to their hair. I have relaxed hair and use this product after washing or when my hair is feeling a little brittle and I can really tell the difference. A little goes along way so it can last for awhile. It also has many good ingredients so give it a try. ,1
"This product is great for combination skin. I used it in my T-zone and on my chin and it did a great job of decreasing the shine. I found I would have to reapply it once about mid-day for it to completely get rid of the shine but people with less oily skin would probably be all set. It didn't smudge my makeup, I use bare escentuals, and left a smooth, soft finish where applied. I would buy this again. Also, you don't need to apply a lot so it should last a while too. ",1
"This product is great, however, like many other buyers I wish the pots were full size. I also could do without the purple pigment. The bronze and the silver and the best. Overall highly pigmented, a good buy. ",1
"This product is great - I have curly hair and it gets dried out if I shampoo every day. It has a nice, fresh smell, though once I have used it, the hair on my crown is frizzy, so I wind up braiding it or wearing it in a pony-tail. But it is perfect for the day or two after I have straightened my hair. ",1
"This product is great. It is in a little jar, you can see how much you have used, unlike the most raved about eye makeup base. A little goes a long way, and it sets my eye makeup all day. I no longer use the Urban Decay cult brand. ",4
This product is great! It is the perfect shade that actually looks as good on me as it does in the package. There is no misrepresentation here! I love it and have gotten tons of compliments on my blush alone!!! ,2
This product is great it leaves ur skin silky smooth which improves the staying power of foundation or powder. I usually use it under foundation or powder it makes a great combination and makes ur skin look flawless,1
"This product is great. It smells amazing, feels cool and soothing going on, and is very light. I use this as my nighttime moisturizer (no SPF). A little goes a long way, so the little jar lasts quite a long time. The packaging is beautiful too... I love adding that bit of luxury to my bathroom with the HydrAction skincare line. ",0
This product is great. I used to use BE mineral foundation but got so tired of the mess all over my bathroom from the loose minerals. This product gives great coverage with a beautiful finish (it does not have that shine that BE does) without a mess all over. The applicator with the sponge on top is a must have. It is so much easier to put on when you are on the go and traveling. ,2
this product is great!!!! my eyeshadow lasted all day with no smearing or creases even when i wiped my eyes it even lasted my eyeliner for a longer amount of time.this product is great and i will continue to use it!!!!,0
"this product is great! when i wear my hair curly/wavy it gives me good definition. if i wear my hair straight, it keeps off flyaways and frizzies. you dont need to use alot because if you do, your hair might end up looking a little greasy. it smells good too. ",0
"This product is incredible! I either use it over the Subli'mine foundation, which is also great, or alone. The powder leaves a soft, matte, yet luminous finish. It instantly improves the look of my skin when I apply it. ",1
This product is like double stick tape for your makeup. It creates a smooth surface for your makeup to cling on to for hours and hours. It also helps hide fine lines. It's definitely a must-do step in your makeup routine for a night out or anywhere there will be a photo op.,1
"This product is my go-to last step, and mid-day refresher. It takes away the cake-y look of some makeups and also locks in my mineral powder application. Not to mention, the spritz is a refreshing feeling that instantly provides a fresh, dewy appearance. Love it!",1
"This product is ok, nothing great though. It does help to dry breakouts and keep them from getting worse, but it doesn't instantly heal them or make them disappear. You can smell the sulfur in it, ok for night but I wouldn't recommend for day. A bit pricey. ",0
"This product is one that reallyis as it advertises. Moisturizing, intense color! I was surprised at how much color was packed in a swipe of the gloss. This product is great if you want true color and not just a tint and glaze. The plum is incredible. ",2
This product is outstanding! Philosophy used to make a mascara similar to this one but stopped making it. I am so glad that Bliss sells this mascara. Is like tubes that cover each lash and comes off so easy when you wash your face. Don't have to worry about smudge or flaking or racoon eyes.,4
"This product is perfect for anyone who washes hands frequently and has problems with ""crocodile"" hand skin. I'm in healthcare and needed something that would go the distance throughout repeated hand washes. Takes a little while to absorb, (a little greasy and sticky at first) but hands feel wonderful after it does. Perfect for nighttime moisturizing. Also great for feet. I'm a true addict and am now on my 6th tin.",2
"This product IS refillable, despite what the box says! I ordered it online and was going to return it to my local Sephora store, but the salesperson SHOWED ME how the bottom unscrews for refill, which they do constantly in the store. I never would've kept it otherwise. It's a great product, and it IS refillable! If you're not sure how, check with your Sephora store! ",3
"This product is revolutionary ... almost fool proof and takes abou three minutes or less!! Simply spray onto a foundation brush and airbrush your way to perfection. The foundation brush is necessaryfor a few reasons: Prevents accidentally spraying hair, clothes, etc., Control of the amount of fluid being used for the face, Gives a very soft effect, concealing EVERY flaw.",1
This product is so amazing. I have annoyed my roommates with my incessant insistence at the awesomeness of this product. I've been wearing eyeshadow as eyeliner lately...and when I use UDEPP ...it stays on ALLLLL DAY! Even through a very very sweaty gym workout! ,0
"This product is sold out usually and its only because its the best product i have ever bought from sephora!! The ball that blendes the concealer hides dark circles and blemishes. The illuminator gives your skin a dewy, bright look which is amazing. Overall i recommend trying this product because you will be hooked! ",0
"This product is something everyone should own. Not only did it help with evening out my skin tone (redness, scars from acne etc.), but it helped with my acne too!!!! Ever since I've used this product my breakouts have disappeared, my skin looks smoother and more radiant, and I get compliments on my skin all the time. I have never used anything like it!",0
This product is soooooo amazing! I live in an area where most tend to get a little greasy no matter what the weather and my make-up stayed fresh for an unbelievable amount of hours. Will def continue to purchase this.... ,0
"this product is the bomb! only takes a little dab in your hand, lather it up on your face and your make-up, even eye make-up, is gone! leaves my skin feeling sooo clean and fresh! it is rich, milky and smooth. love it, love it. worth the $ too because it lasts for a long time. you won't need eye make-up remover or anything else but this anymore. try it!",1
This product is truly different from any mascara I've tried. The brushes separate lashes wonderfully and the small brush for bottom lashes really lets you get to every lash. It really restores length to those of us who are lacking the youthful long-lashed look. And my teenage granddaughter has tried to take it over. You won't be disappointed!! ,4
This product is very addicting and it is hard not to use everyday. It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. It smells great too! My husband notices when I use it and he is sensitive to strong scents. We like this one even if it's on the pricey side for everyday use.,2
"This product is very cost effective considering the amazing benefits. The pump measures the perfect amount and that is about the size of a pea. I have been using it every day for six months and i will buy more once that last drop is rendered. My skin was getting netted with fine lines. This product made a dramatic difference. I then use my regular moisturizer which has a sunscreen (which is recommended). On some days though I admit that i may just use the Prevage, a nourishing primer and mineral makeup and i am out of the house and my skin looks great. ",3
"This product is very easy to use, just be sure you're in good lighting and be aware of how much you're adding because it can be easy to apply too much and make your face look like there is too much makeup. ",0
"This product is very misleading in its promise to deliver ""'false eyelash-like' results."" When I hear ""false eyelashes,"" I think big, fat, voluminous, and curly. The brush is very flimsy and only made my lashes longer after several coats. My boyfriend remarked that I had spidery Cleopatra eyelashes, which was definitely NOT the look I was going for. ",1
"this product is very pricey, but it does what it says it will do. I don't wear it every day, but whenever I do I get compliments on my complexion - for real. people suddenly think I have this great skin I never knew I had! I don't have a lot of skin issues, but this definitely enhances the look and makes me feel confident.",0
This product is watered down! I was completely excited when I first got it.. but as I stared to put it on... I realized I needed more of the product then normal..because it looked so thin! I'm thinking about returning it.,0
"This product is wonderful for combo skin! I have an oily t-zone and breakout occasionally. Since using this product I have not had a breakout (using for 5 weeks now). Also, my skin looks and feels great. This does not leave you feeling dry or taut like other cleansers designed for combo skin. Just leaves you with clean skin!",2
this product is wonderful. it's sweet and simple. i love it because it is the only perfume i have found that my bf isn't allergic to. he loves this scent and so do i. it's a raspberry twist with almost a cotton candy like taste. it's my favorite♥,0
"This product is worth the money. I have noticed it start to go bad and separate after about 4 months. Since you only need about the size of a pea, I suggest you buy the smaller size. Use on ends only. Gets oily buildup at roots. ",2
"This product kind of worked but I had several problems with it. A. The printing (the lettering and graphics) on the tube would flake off onto my hands and end up all over me. B. Later in the day, if I rubbed my skin, the lotion would just flake off. C. Didn't smell too great. D. I use a lot of lotion and this product went quick. A little does not go a long way. E. Too expensive.",0
"this product makes my man smell incredibe ,I get in his arms and when I smell how good he smells it makes me forget everything but him .This was my second purchase of this product it is awesone and very affordable",4
"This product performs as stated. It immediately starts plumping my lips, and stays on for a long time. I do have to be careful not to get it on the sensitive skin around my lips, though. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product. ",3
This product prepares skin to receive make-up like no other I've tried. The smoothness is remarkable. It feel nice and takes very little to prepare the skin. It doesnn't seem to cause any problems with breakout either. This product meets advertised promises.,4
"This product really helped my hair to grow years ago. I don't know why I stopped using it but, I'm soooooo happy I found it again. Smells strong, tingles and it will linger on everything you touch. For good results leave on scalp at least 4 hours or overnight. ",1
"This product smells great and does wonders at eliminating frizz. I especially like to use this when I let my hair dry naturally to really define my waves. If I don't use this, I just get frizz and fuzz. ",3
This product stays in place and when wet makes an excellent liner. The color I bought was stiletto and was not quite what I expected it to be. As an older eyed woman I did find that it did not crease. ,3
"This product truly creates another ""canvas"" for the application of makeup--or to go without. I bought it to hide areas of my cheeks with visible pores, and it works. I was so happy with it that I bought some for my 66 year old mother as well, she loves it, and she wears it every day. This primer seems to treat the face as well as act as a daily makeup aid--my complexion seems smoother after using it (for about a month), and is truly one of life's luxuries! ",2
"This product was okay. It did not burn, sting or tingle once applied to the skin. The product remaiins slightly tacky once dried. It did not cause my skin to flake or peel. It has a slightly offensive odor but it will dissipate. It did begin to gradually fade discoloration and red marks as Murad claimed it would BUT it also made my acne prone skin to break out severely. The breakouts I suffered left more red marks and discoloration, so overall it wasn't worth the money or effort.",1
This product was recommended to me in store several years ago. I have been using it once a week ever since. May skin feels super smooth and clean after use. I also feel that it does promote a smoother all-over skin tone with regular use. ,4
"this product will remove just about any kind of eye makeup -- i use a lot of waterproof makeup for my eyes so this is just about the only product that can remove it all for me. the only thing is it's a bit oily, but i guess thats how it works so well.",1
"This product worked with lightening my underarms after my baby. However the odor protection leaves much to be desired, perhaps tho from the post pregnancy hormones.\nI like that it makes my skin feel smooth and doesn't burn after shaving but I always have to follow it with my regular antiperspirant.",1
"This product works fantastic for a multitude of reasons, first I use it in the morning under my make up. It is an excellent primer. Additionally, I have found that it has offered an improvement in the overall condition of my skin. Just a note, I am using the lineless cream and the lazer in a bottle serum in conjuction with this product. I highly recommend all these products!!!! ",2
this product works pretty well. i usually have a hard time getting my eye make up but this does the job. It doesnt work will unless you use a cotton ball or pad. Ive been out before and had to use kleenex and it didnt work at all. ,0
"this product works really well, a little goes a long way, if you have an oily scalp and youre concerned about buildup this is the way to go cause it volumizes without leaving all this crud in your hair that ends up making it flat at the end of the day. ",0
"This product works really well when you just don't have the time or ambition to wash your brushes. It's great for switching from one color to the next mid-application, then giving your brushes a thorough cleaning after you get home. ",1
"This product works to fade my age spots as well as any more expensive product that I have tried. It doesn't make them disappear, but it does lighten them. I have oily skin and it feels good and doesn't make me break out. ",4
This Quick-Stick is the best thing I've found in the way of lipstick in a long time. The color last la ong time and soooo creamy and very versatile! I always have mine in my purse to apply over lip gloss or with other more glossy lip sticks or wear alone for a full coverage that lasts and lasts. Sometimes I use it as a lip liner and apply another lighter color base. I use it all the time and still have not used it all up! I am a lipstick fanatic and comparing apples to apples this rose color is way better and costs half the price of the competition. I'm hooked!!! ,3
"This really defines my browbone after I use my brow powder and it ""erases"" any mistakes I make. I wouldn't use it as an eyeshadow base, it would pull on the eyelid too much. I look forward to trying the new Brow Duality as it has a shimmer pencil on one end for evening. ",2
"This really did not work as a tanner but did impart a nice, healthy glow that is kind of vaguely sun-kissed with peach tones, but certainly not a tan....really subtle which is natural and better than looking colored and fake. It smells nice and is a great moisturizer. I do recommend this but not as a self-tanner. ",3
this really helps to maintain the gosmile whitening products. and i love love love the two flavors and wish all toothpaste tasted this good. my only criticism is that i wish it went a bit further. you have to use more than i'm used to using from a regular toothpaste. ,2
"This really is fabulous mascara. I have puny short lashes, and these really bring them out without the horrors of clumping. I have tried Dior (Blackout, Iconic, Diorshow), Blinc Kiss Me, Stila, Clinique etc. and this is by the far the best. Whenever I try another mascara, I always end up going back to this one or have to put a coat of it to try and 'correct' the shortcomings of the other mascara. The brush does an excellent job of separating and defining and is an appropriate size for smaller lashes (unlike Diorshow, which made it look like I had TWO giant lashes - horrible!). It also doesn't weigh down my lashes and holds my curl. It doesn't work quite as well on my bottom lashes - I find that it does smudge a bit - but I may start using the waterproof version on the bottom.\n\nOverall - an excellent buy for those of you ladies who aren't genetically blessed with long lashes!",0
"This REALLY is the PERFECT lipstick!!! I have been looking for years. A beautiful balance between a pink and a taupe, with just the right amount of shimmer. This actually shows up on my lips and doesn't disappear! It stays true and so delightfully creamy...please NARS, don't ever discontinue this one!",2
"This really keeps eyeliner where it should be! I have hooded lids and always have my eyeliner transfer onto my eyelids. This is the first product that keeps my eyeliner (pencil, liquid, and gel) stay! When applied, it also doesn't disrupt the eyeliner, but smoothly goes on over it. It doesn't sting if you get it into your eyes, but I've found that it's better not to get it onto my contacts. This is a wonderful product that I cannot be without! ",2
"this really mattifies like nobody's business and goes on like silk! not seeing dramatic effects re: pores, but this definitely dries up the oil on your face tout de suite! in fact, i use this as spot treatment for bumps and it gives more immediate results than other products i've tried. the reviews on here about clogged pores are a bit worrying, so i'll probably just use this sparingly when i need to, but it gives me peace of mind knowing i have it in my arsenal for when the situation (blemish) arises. seems like results vary alot with this one, so just ask for a sample before buying and try it out!",1
"This really seems to work well but is very drying, even on my very oily skin. I started using the products one at a time instead of using everything, every time. That seems to have helped a lot. I also think this is helping my hyperpigmentation! YEAH! ",2
"This really takes off make up! I've never heard of or used a cleanser that removed make up and cleansed the skin also.\nIt's so gentle, and my face feel so clean after using it.\n(It's also great for cleaning make up brushes)",0
This really works! And lasts! It can be difficult to use however. It tends to dry and clump and not blend well. Hint: if you try this product I have the best luck dabbing on with a dampened cosmetic sponge. ,2
"This really works for my skin type. I know things don't work for everyone, but I would recommend a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the decreased amount of surface oil on my face, and I can be so oily at times that my eyelids are oily and my eyes start to sting. I was generous with my application and I used the Never Let Them See You Shine Cleanser first. Great product. I will pick up 2 more after the holiday so that I can keep one in my purse for touch-ups. ",2
"This really works--no sting but does plump. It's a tad sticky, but not too sticky that I won't buy this again and again. Tons of great shades for everyone. I love to wear them alone or on top of the LipFusion lip pencil. ",1
"this reduced the puffiness under my eyes, i have allergies and nothing seemed to work, i tried this product and noticed within a few days my eyes looked better. very hydrating also, i noticed my fine lines are less noticeable. ",2
"This reminded me of the Benefit scent when I first sampled it. I bought it because it's more lasting. When I look all at the fragrances I own, the common note is white flowers. L has this plus fruit and fun. ",4
"This review is really for the clarsonic, along with the brush. First off, being a skin and makeup geek, I really love this little skincare brush. It really and truly removes all my makeup and prepares my skin for my serums and moisturizes. Before this item, I would always find traces of makeup let on my skin, but not now. After using, I apply my serum and moisture and my face glows. Three friends of mine have bought this item after seeing my face glow from using it. They were really stunned. This was money well spent, and I cannot even think of ever going without it. I don't have acne, but have very sensitive skin that was prone to acne if not treated appropiately. Let me tell you, no irritation, no dry patches, no more unevenness. Just soft, glowing and beautiful skin.",3
This salt scrub is a delicious and smoothing sweet treat! Smells like a slice of coconut cake and works wonders iespecially on heels and knees. I use it twic a week for smooth soft arms and legs and feel like a pampered star! ,3
"This sampler set is amazing. You get a variety of awesome mini sized mascaras, this way you can see which one you like best. What better way to test drive a new mascara than this set? Saves money and time. A definite steal. ",0
This scent is a beautiful fleminine sweet flirty scent. It is very strong at first application but the scent dissipates after a few hours. I was hoping it would last longer since it's relatively expensive. Its a wonderful flowery scent that would get 5 stars if it lasted longer. ,0
"This scent is a beautiful, fresh scent with a sweetness to it that always makes me feel very elegant, sexy, ladylike (and expensive!). The bottle is beautiful too, and I love having it displayed on my dresser. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because it's not what I need for an everyday scent. ",0
"This scent is absoutely wonderful, and the size of this rollerball is great, but the shimmer is way to much for me. I thought alittle shimmer would be fine, but this shimmer is over the top, so much so that it's like playing in my granddaughters makeup or glitter fingernail polish, but it does smell delightful. ",3
"This scent is a nice scent for summer, but yet it has nice woodsy notes in it, that you can wear year around! It lasts ,and it just smells so good!!! I get lot's of compliments on this one,men Love It!",1
"This scent is scrumptious.Its an awesome combo of cakey vanilla + butter cookies..the most yummy vanilla! I loved triple layer cake but this is way better.I've been waiting so long for this to come out,I got everything except the butter which I will pick up.I may buy backups b/c I don't want to run out! Buy this now if you're a gourmand scent lover! ",0
"This scent is sooo wonderful !!!!! I encounter people who say, ""you smell so good."" It is a very sweet scent, that reminds me of country fairs & happy times. My sweetie says it smells lickably sweet & yummy ~ ",4
This scent is unique. It's my personal favorite. It's very soft and light weight. This fragrance is great for most women because it has such a nice scent no one would call it a grandma perfume or a body spray for teens. This scent defines elegance and beauty.,0
"this scent is very flowery, but in a nice way. i am not big on floral perfumes, but i really like this one. it smells really fresh, and is one of the only perfumes my husband comments on (usually he is pretty indifferent). it stays on for a long time if i spray it on my clothes, but on my skin it fades reletively fast. AND, the bottle looks so pretty, it doubles as decor! ",1
This scent sampler is awesome and what a great gift idea!! It is a great way to find out what scent really works for you and then you get to pick up the scent of your choice with the certificate. I picked mine up in Las Vegas while I was there on vacation and it was quick and easy. LOVE IT!!! GREAT IDEA!!!!! ,2
This scent struck me when I smelled someone with it. It is incredibly refreshing but at the same time sharp. It reminds me of flowers and citrus or acidic fruits. Definitely very youthful and works well for daytime.,0
"This scrib smells delicious! It leaves your skin feeling soft and exfoliated. It is very thick, therefore it is hard to spread on skin. I find that I end up dropping some of it while using it in the shower when I'm applying it. I think it is kind of dry. I've used other scrubs that are more oily which I think I prefer. I would not purchase this again but will enjoy what I have left. ",1
This scrub is great on your skin without being too harsh. The scent stays with you for about an hour after shoering. I have found my skin to be softer since using this scrub. I use is 4 times a week. Very gentle. If lloking for a more scented product pick something else. ,2
"This scrub not only smell good enough to eat, the consistency is great. It is thick and does an excellent job in exfoliating the dry skin from your body. You are left with a soft, smooth texture. I would buy it again, in a heartbeat. Well worth the money. ",3
"This scrub smells so good and I love the texture, it makes my skin nice and soft. I did run out of oil and the salt got dry, but i just broke apart the salt with a spoon and it still works great! I like to use it before I shave to make my skin soft and smooth. ",2
"This self-tanner for face went on smoothly and didn't make me break out, but the color was a little deep for me. I have pretty fair skin but this made me look crazy dark. People noticed the rapid change in my skin color and it kinda freaked me out. ",2
"This self tanner is a foam consistency, but it too thick to be properly spread making it impossible to go streak free. It certainly does not glide like noted above. Beyond that I could see the streaks as I put it on and hopped in the shower before it set in and wound up with hands and nails the color of the bottle for the next week from it just being on briefly. It was really a nightmare. ",0
This self tanning gel doesn't really stand out much compared to others. It has a very typical sunless tanner smell and it doesn't seem to dry right away. I had to wait awhile before applying any makeup. I don't know that I would buy it again.,1
"This serum is the perfect mate to the correction cream. Using them together has given me amazing results. I look younger and my skin feels incredible. I can sometimes get a bit dry skinned in the winter, but this has really balanced my skin and is keeping it looking wonderful. ",3
This serum smooths out the fine lines and wrinkles and works really well under make up. I use it at night also and it moisturizes great. I have been using a product that really dries my skin out and the skin under my eyes was so dry that I actually had peeling. I applied this product twice each day and in 2 days the problem was solved! ,3
"This serum works for helping to smooth wrinkles and keeping my skin more taut, but unfortunately doesn't really help for dark spots which is what I really wanted it for... I guess it's fine for wrinkles and to firm your skin but there are other face creams out there that do this for half the price... disappointed but will keep looking. ",3
"This serum works... my eyebrows were pretty sparse and after about 2 weeks of using this, I noticed my brows filling in... I also like it because it keeps the hairs groomed... not cheap, but it's good stuff. ",3
"This set is a fantastic gift idea. All the shower gels come arranged inside the cookbook, and each bottle has a recipe. It serves two purposes by giving someone cooking ideas and fabulous shower gels. The scents are very true to their names must like all other Philosophy shower gels. They also lather very well without stripping moisture, so they last a long time. ",1
This set is a great buy. The shampoo is thicker than I've seen but smells heavely!!! You really feel like it's cleaning & moisturizing your hair. The condition left my hair soft and smelling great. The hair oil provides great moisture and is a great alternative to hair balm. You will fall in love with this line. ,1
"This set is the best value out there for great eye pencils. They go on smoothly and wear better than higher priced pencils. The colors go with most everything, however, I don't know what to do with the white one. I will be ordering more! ",4
"This set layers the perfect scent of fresh and unique. While it is not overpowering, anyone who wears Amazing Grace won't go unnoticed. It is perfect for everyday. Amazingly, it makes a great gift for a loved one. They will think of you with every use. ",2
"this set smells just like soda! I love it (It tastes kinda sweet)! But as a lip gloss, it's ok. It offers great lip moisture, and it looks glossy, but the color is very timid, so it'll look like a layer of clear gloss on your lips. ",0
"This set was great. It has lasted a little over 2 months, but I am now just about out. Personally I use the conditioner as a leave-in on my ends when my hair is wet and before I blow-dry it. You only need a pea-size of each one to work wonders. This stuff is seriously amazing. If you give it two weeks, you will see a huge improvement in your hair. My hair is extremely dry and damaged, but this has made my hair grow, as well as soften it. I would reccommend using a different shampoo (like herbal essences break's over or hello hydration), and then use this shampoo in order to achieve that ""very clean"" feeling. But trust me, it is definitely worth shampooing your hair twice. Another bonus is that it smells fantastic. ",0
This set was just what I needed to add a little something special to the look I wanted! It was just the right amount of glitter to make an occasion special without looking crass. Sparkle with class! I love it and got many compliments on my make-up! ,3
"This shadow group has unbelievable colors. The colors are true, intense, and stay all day. I use a wet liner brush to create my eyeliner nad it also goes on smoothly and stays all day. Bought a second one in the other colors. ",3
This shadow is great. It's also fun because they give you four colors so you can really play around with different things. Also good to note that this is really good shadow for sensitive skin and eyes ,0
"This shadow really stays put. I love the smokey eye look, but have never really mastered it, or when I do, it doesn't stay put. The 'Skinny Jeans' shade makes the perfect smokey eye----no seperate liner required & it looks 'smudgy' as soon as you put it on----PERFECTION! ",3
"This shampoo is great for getting my dry, frizzy hair to look and feel softer. You MUST wash twice with this shampoo. I've notice the first wash produces less suds, so don't worry and use more shampoo. The second wash should stay on for at least 2 minutes to take full advantage of the oils in the shampoo. ",0
"This shampoo is very nourishing and hydrating, and foams really well, I gave it 4 stars because it took a lot to get my hair clean because of how thick my hair is. If you have finer hair, or not horribly dry hair this is fantastic! ",0
"This shampoo lathers very well and makes my color-treated, chemically-straightened hair soft, silky and very manageable. The scent is one of the freshest and pleasant smelling of all the shampoos I have tried throughout the years. ",4
"This shampoo/shower gel combo is phenomenal. First off, the scent is wonderful - calming and innocent, yet completely unique (unless, of course, there's another Philosophy fan in your circle of friends). Secondly, the shampoo works wonders. I have curly, frizzy hair that gets temperamental during the tiniest weather change - but this shampoo actually keeps everything under control. My hair feels silky and looks shinier - better than any other shampoo I've tried. I highly recommend this!",1
"This shaving cream has changed my partner's daily routine! It helps him get a close & smooth shave, prevent nicks & blemishes, & moisturize & protect his skin. It smells great, though not too strong (it won't compete with other perfumes, etc). Fantastic product!!!",1
"This sheer lipstick is the best! When you use it, you don't need a separate lip balm to moisturize your lips. And the color looks natural, but better than natural--polished but not overdone. I love it when something I use every day can be so simple and so perfect.",4
This sheer textured blush bronzer goes on super smooth... never grabs. May be applied sheer from the peach side for a pretty blush or warmed up to a beautiful bronze from the Bronze side. Excellent value! I was pleasantly surprised by the qaulity. ,4
This shiny This shiny shellac will make any color eye pop. Use Glam Rock over the top of black liquid liner to line your lids and dab beneath lower lashes for instant shine. A little Mullet alone with a bright white shadow makes green eyes dangerously daring. Heavy Metal Glitter Liner adds a little punk or pretty to any look.,0
This should be called 'FABULUSH'. It's such a surprise as we ladies age how everything changes and not for the best. Now my hair is gray and my lashes are thinning but when I us Dior's Diorshow Mascara it makes my lashes look full and I must say YUMMIE. Highly recommend this product. And Sephora make shopping so easy and fun. ,4
"This shower gel is my absolute favorite! It smells like a little piece of heaven. My only complaint is that the smell fades too quickly. My tip is that you should buy the Lemon Sugar perfume, and layer the scent. Yum!!! My skin also feels soft and fabulous after using this shower gel...not dry or flaky.",2
"This shower gel rocks! It's nice and thick, and lathers like there's no tomorrow. I love to use it when I shave - the razor glides on my skin, and my legs are smooth and moisturized. I will definitely be purchasing more, just haven't decided which scent to try next. ",2
"This simply didn't work for me. It leaves, even with a very light dusting, a flat matte look. If you think that will get rid of shine, nope. It comes right back after an hour. It also makes your skin slightly ashy. Tried to make it work several times and still don't like it. ",3
"This smells amazing and it feels so good. I wanted to just keep washing my face. Afterward, my skin felt clean and content, never stripped. Too bad that my combo/blemish prone skin broke out, and I had to return it.",2
"This smells delicious. It's dark, woodsy, and mysterious, but with a lingering sweetness that keeps pulling you in. I bought this for my boyfriend, and when he wears it, I can't help but keep close to him, it smells so good. ",0
"This smells sooo good. It's very very feminine. I also love that it's in a roll on so I can always put more on any time and any place. I'mtrying to order more for myself and as gifts right now, but it's currently sold out. ",1
This soap is Absolutely Wonderful!!! Smells just like the Fresh Lemon Lotion & Cologne....Leaves you feeling Fresh and Tension Free! With no soapy residue...\nLove it!! Try it........YOU won't be Disappointed I am sure :),4
"This soap is great. I've used tons of face soaps and always had allergic reactions, even with really expensive products. I've been using this soap for 6 months, which is pretty much a record for me. It cleans well. Sometimes I use a toner to make sure there's no residue.",1
"This stain is wonderful! You can use it 1) alone for a long-lasting, natural looking, comfortable feeling, stain of color or 2) as a base before lipstick, gloss, or lipbalm for a different look and to have color left when everything else wears off. All this and you can use it on your cheeks, too! ",3
"This starter ot really does take the guess work out! All products in the set blend easily, giving the appearance of a professional job. The liner shadow is my favorite since it goes on so smoothly. Other liners get gloppy but this is a snap! Including the correct brushes is huge for people just starting out. ",3
"THIS STAYS ON. Through long days, rain, snow, eye drops--you name it. This is the only mascara that will stick with me. You need a good quality remover (like purity made simple by philosophy) to remove this product. ",2
"This stays put, through drinking and eating. It also doesnt' bleed, much better for slighter older women who have problems with really fine lines around the mouth, the color can be darkened with more application or lighter with a tint.",2
"This stuff covers very well and is easy to apply. My only issue is that it seems ot be a bit shimmery although it doesn't seem to look too shimmery once you're done with all your makeup. The ""shiny"" actually helps divert attention from dark circles and whatever else you're trying to conceal. ",3
"This stuff goes on like a dream! I stay shine-free all day and never look like my Aunt Tilly! My make-up stays in place without ever looking cakey. Also - a bonus for us mature ""girls"" - this somehow miraculously does NOT intensify in your ""character lines""!",4
"This stuff has worked really well for my skin. Sometimes my skin is dry, sometimes oily, sometimes it's flawless... depends on the weather I guess. It's gentle, doesn't leave my skin feeling tight, and best of all it actually cleans.",0
This stuff is amazing and all natural too! It doesn't take much product to see results. I noticed a change after the very 1st time I used it. Asborbs quickly and feels so refreshing on the skin. It is a little on the expensive side but is soooo worth it.,1
"This stuff is amazing! I asked for something to help reduce blackheads around my nose, a problem I have had since puberty, and in a week they were visibly smaller, lighter in color, and are continuing to fade!! The best 40 bucks I ever spent! (and I am a poor law school student!) ",0
"This stuff is amazing! I have only been using it for a few weeks, and already there is a visable difference in my skin. My skin is much firmer, and the smaller wrinkels are starting to dissapear. Can't wait to see what happens with longer use. I would highly recomed this product to anyone. ",3
"This stuff is amazing! I have used other primers but they've never lived up to their claims. This one surpasses all claims. I have oily lids that tend to crease very heavily. After putting this on, letting it dry a couple of minutes, then putting my eye shadow on I'm set for the day. Whereas before any eye makeup I put on would only last about two hours, now it lasts until I take it off. Even if I scracth my eyelids the shadow doesn't noticeably come off. It also makes the colors come alive. I have absolutely no creases, smudging, nothing. You do need to blend it with your finger because the wand isn't really made for applying it well, but it doesn't even really dirty your fingers, just wipe them with a tissue. I will never wear eyeshadow without this again, and neither should you! ",2
"This stuff is amazing! It doesn't smell like most facial cleansers and it doesn't dry out my skin either! It gently removes all makeup and oil, etc. on my skin at the end of the day. I love the formula too - it feels nice and smooth and is the best that I have ever, ever used. Get it!",0
"this stuff is amazing. its so light on ur skin and u dont even need that much to cover up your face. Its a lightweight powder and it doenst ruin your skin, and i have extremely sensitive skin so i should know. So if you love mineral foundation this is the one for u!!! ",0
"This stuff is amazing! The ingredients aren't scary and it works like a charm! I honestly don't know what I did before this stuff - oh wait, I ruined my nails before they dried. Buy it, you won't regret it. ",0
"This stuff is amazing! The very first night I used it, my boyfriend couldn't stop touching my skin and saying how soft it was. It also smells pretty good--like lemon lollipops, which is refreshing for in the shower, but it doesn't linger which is perfect for me since I can't wear scents at my job. It is rather expensive, though, so I would suggest using it on those special occasions when you really want your skin to feel amazing.",1
This stuff is awesome! It goes on really smooth and light.... If you mix it with the fx foundation it works AMAZING.\nI LOVE THIS... I recommend it to anyone! Especially people who have issues with caking on their make-up. It looks natural and makes your skin flawless.,0
"This stuff is DY-NO-MITE!! I am a very picky hair product person and I love this Phyto product. I have found it to do just what it says it does and more...if I let my short hair air dry, it even helps turn up the volume on my natural curl. Can't and won't live without this product! ",4
"This stuff is fantastic, and does exactly what it says it will. I like the new packaging - the cap stays on, and the plastic bottle is much lighter than the old glass bottle. This set is a great price for the two, and the smaller one is perfect for travel ",2
"This stuff is great! I love the smell. It's strong but not overbearing @ all. It's almost like it coats your skin. I don't need to wear lotion after using this cuz my skin is so smooth from it, there's no point. My skin doesn't get dry and holds in the moisture for awhile. Did I mention I love this stuff!!!",1
"This stuff is great. I'm not crazy about the fragrance, I don't hate it though, but once it dries you can't smell it anyway. I have dry, sensitive skin and I do think it calms my skin and feels great. I like to spray it on top of my makeup to refresh midday.",1
"this stuff is great. it goes on smooth, is not dry, and doesn't flake off, or look like lipliner after a few hours. best of all it feels great and moisturizing. i've been searching for this for 20 years. amen!! ",3
"This stuff is great. It really does smell like oranges. I can't detect any pepper so I don't know what that's about, but the orange is definately there. It smells as if you just cut into an orange! I wish they'd come out with a spray mist for it. The smell of oranges just makes you feel happy and light. And we all know how great body butter is, especially in the winter. ",4
"This stuff is great. It works really well to remove all make-up, dirt, and oil from your face. As an acne control, it doesn't work so well. It smells really nice and you only have to use a tiny amount to get what you need. It isn't exfoliating but as a cleanser there is nothing to beat this stuff.",0
"This stuff is great. Your makeup will stay on pretty well, unless it's so hot out, and in my opinion there is nothing you can do about that but, it is worth the money, you will not have to reapply your makeup many times a day.",0
this stuff is grrrrrrreat! i use it over moisturiser and under liquid foundation and it goes on smooth\nif u have oily skin remember to use photo finish LIGHT not this one because it's made especially for you\nworks best on people with drier to medium skin so make sure u're using the right one\nit works amazing and leaves my skin so smooth and glowing!,0
This stuff is really great if you use any water resistant or waterproof products on your eyes. it just melts the makeup right off. No tugging or rubbing needed; just a gentle swipe and you are good to go.,1
This stuff is really great! It makes you look fabulousy tan. The only problem is the directions tell you to click to start it! There is no click! You have to depress the bottom button several times to get the liquid out. Other than that it is awesome. Just change the directions on the package! ,4
This stuff is really interesting. It really does make your lips buzz a bit. The best part is that it moisturizes your lips and can be dipped in any of the mineral colors to go on you lips. You can't beat it for experimenting with lip colors. ,3
This stuff is so good smelling I love to wear the body butter sometimes alone on my hands just to smell the goodness and by the way the body butter which I bought previously is good on dry hands. The bodywash is scrumptious and rich in the shower and is thick and doesn't leave any residue washes off nicely!! ,2
"This stuff is SOOO worth every penny. My skin tends to be dry and dull with occasional breakouts and when I'm using these daily face peels my skin looks absolutely amazing. The travel packs don't dry out and are portable, and therefore worth the few extra dollars they cost over the regular non-travel packs. I have gotten several friends hooked on these. If there is one skincare product you should splurge on it's this. It's also amazing for a hangover when your skin just looks ""dead"" -- It will give you an instant glow. ",1
"This stuff is unreal. This is my first Nars product and definately not my last. It lasts forever, and I have oily skin so thats saying a lot. The color is amazing and makes you look so fresh and healthy. It seems to last forever too. I use it everyday and it doesnt even look Ive touched it, really wierd but great. I highly recommend!",0
This stuff is wonderful! It really makes your hair soft and healthy looking. I blow dry and flat iron my hair at least 4 times a week and it really helps with the damaging effects of styling tools. I would highly recommend! ,2
This stuff is wonderful. I've used other brands..ie the sephora brow gel and it does not compare at all. It lasted for so long. I'm so excited to now be able to use this and not worry how my brow shape will look in a couple hours. so easy to use too!,1
"This stuff really stays on! I have never found another eyeliner that doesn't end up on my upper lid towards the middle of the day. Though if you want to smudge this stuff, you better do it pretty quickly after you put it on, because it won't be moving after about 15 seconds.",1
"This stuff REALLY works, I use Proactiv to keep my oily skin from breaking out and was a little worried about using this product for the fear of it clogging my pores.. I have been using it for almost a month now and so far no breakouts! Also my job requires me to look pretty much perfect and all times even after hours of jumping around..I didnt see how it really ""evened out"" my skintone but..This keeps my concealer in place! The only thing I say is make sure you wait a few min. before applying makeup over top to give the product time to dry so it works correctly.This is the BEST purchase I have EVER made!",0
"This stuff smells like a public restroom that has just been cleaned! Definitely not the type of ""clean"" smell I expected; I thought it would smell fresh and inviting, instead it has the scent of a lemony bathroom cleaner! I'm actually too embarrassed to wear this in public. I would definitely advise someone to spend their money on a different perfume.",0
"This stuff was soo thick that it was kind of ridiculous to use a small amount and get it even without mixing it with a lighter cream. It really stinks also..Smells like medicine. But, I barely noticed a change at all...I will not buy again.",0
"This stuff will take off ANYTHING with a swipe or two - waterproof, ultra-long-wearing, Bi-Facil will get rid of it immediately. It does leave a bit of oily film behind; I get around this by taking off eye makeup and then immediately washing my face.",1
"This stuff works. It will give you dark, long, thick lashes without clumping. So why do I hardly ever use it? Well, first of all, it STINKS! It smells SO chemically. Second of all, the little fibers will come off my lashes, get in my eyes and hurt SO badly. Lastly, it doesn't come off with traditional cotton ball and makeup remover (this will make my lashes fall out). Instead, I have to stick my face under the shower and rub my lashes, then it comes off easily, but I hate getting water in my eyes because it irritates them so badly. So, a great product, just not for me. ",0
"this sugar scrub really does the job - it has a light smell that won't overpower you in the shower or detract from perfumes or lotions. Its not very harsh (sugar crystals, so they dissolve in your skin with increasing scrubbing), but exfoliates well and leaves skin super-super moisturized and soft. Comes with a plastic scooper so you'r enot digging your fingers into the jar each time. ",1
"This summer I set out to find the perfect fragrance for me - you know, the one that just feels RIGHT.\nI have pretty severe allergies, and just about anything can set me off. I left Sephora with 20+ samples of perfumes to try out, and I fell in love with this one. It's light and playful, with just a hint of sexiness. I adore it. And it doesn't even tickle my allergies! Some perfumes, like all Ralph Laurens, will have me in a sneezing fit in two minutes flat. This let me smelling delicious and feeling free.",0
"This super-lightweight powder is the ultimate finish. You only need a small amount as the final step before lipstick to create a poreless complexion. I have larger pores on my nose & cheeks. This literally erases them! And, it lasts all day or night without reapplying! A MUST have! ",2
"This surprisingly sheer, fine textured, easy to blend Bronzer takes my pale face to a warm, healthy rbonze. Depending on mood and season you can add a little ""sun"" or fresh from the beach look. Great value! ",4
"This system is intensive, yet gentle, in that it is effective but it does not overly irritate or inflame the skin. The whole process takes very little time. The chamomile step, the last one, is especially soothing. Skin is left glowing and polished. Highly recommended. ",4
"This tastes just like pumpkin pie or pumpkin muffins. I love anything pumpkin, so I think it's wonderful. It has great shine and moisture, but it is hard to keep from licking my lips constantly because it tastes so good. I would recommend this one to anyone. ",3
This the best mascara that I have tried thus far! It does everything it is suppose to do. No other mascara has made my lashes look the way this product does. Love it and will definitely continue to use it.,0
This Tinted Moisturiser is the BEST!!!!! I am 45 yrs. old and it's best if I don't wear powder foundation. This product has improved my skin by refining my pores and smoothing out lines. Thanks Korres!!!!!!! Love it!!! ,3
This tinted moisturizer in Light is to yellow for my NW15-20 complexion. I love the texture and the dewy finish but I wish Shiseido would think of their pinky undertone customer. I won't repurchase unless they have a color that suits me. ,4
This tinted moisturizer is very greasy. I had to put a ton of loose powder over it to combat the oiliness. It also made my pores appear huge and the color looked ahsy on my light olive skin. I love most Benefit products but this one is certainly not for me. ,3
"This toner is alcohol-free so it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using this toner for a month now and my skin cleared up. I used to have pimples on my forehead and now its all gone. Thanks to this Shisheido toner. Highly recommend for combination skin (dry cheeks, oily t-zone)",1
"This toner is very refreshing and the scent is wonderful, but the packaging is a problem. The spritzer needs a bit of priming to get it started and then sprays heavily rather than in a fine mist. If this problem were corrected it would be a 5-star product, but since this is a big issue for me I took off 2 stars for this packaging defect. ",4
This tonic is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and this cools and refreshes and tones with no problem. I stopped using it for several months at noticed a huge decline in my skin. I will never stop using it again. It does not dry my skin and I can use it year round. ,0
"This top coat gave a fair sheen. I would have preferred a bit glossier coat but overall pretty decent. Top coat dried pretty quickly and with the drying drops I was able to ""function"" within about 15 - 20 minutes. I will buy this again because it's one of the better top coats overall. ",2
"this totally helps your eye product stay on all day and prevents creasing however, sometimes it's just too ""white"" in color for me (especially in the summer when i'm tan) and that's really the only issue i have with it. it blends well and makes your eyeshadow color appear ""true"" on your lids. ",1
"This train case is very well made. It is more on the ""classy"" and chic side, because it is made of a beautifl texture on the outside and made exellent on the inside. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but I have ALOT of makeup!I gave it to my daughter for her birthday, she LOVED it!! I may try to get another for myself. GREAT VALUE for a Sephora train case!!!! ",3
This truly is a unique collection. The new colors are amazing! I was blown away by the glam beauty of this set. The red glitter mascara is a hoot!!! Not sure I'd ever wear it in public but I might if I get an urge to be noticed wherever I go. :D The bag will hold the entire Ruby collection if the powders are placed on the bottom (otherwise the bag won't close properly). The Ruby Buxom Lips full color is so fabulous! It is as glamorous as glam gets! The shadows have amazing depth and subtle metallic sheen. This is Leslie's best collection so far (and I'm including the Platinum collection). ,3
"This truly smells just like a glass of freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice. I use it every day in the shower during the hot summer months, not just for the scent but because it works. Even better, it doesn't dry out my skin. ",4
"This value kit with everything needed to create the ""Flawless Face"" sold me on the Laura Mercier Brand. I've bought several. The primer is the best I've used... moist bought not oily slick and gives the skin a luminous but not greasy glow. The tinted moisture is blendable, not too dark for my fair skin and gives enough coverage I now use for foundation. The powder is the sheerest I have ever used! Plus you recieve quality brushes to achieve the ""Look"". ",4
This version is horrible. The small brush barely put the mascara on your lashes and half of it ended up on the face. Not good to control. I've used Diorshow for years and should not have tried this. I ended up exchanging it for my old standby Diorshow. ,2
"This was a decent enough mascara. Personally I think Lancom, and Mabelline have better mascara's. One major problem I had with it though was that the product irritated my eyes pretty badly. I had red eyes the entire time I used the mascara and after I returned it my eyes cleared back up. I love Benefit but I was dissapointed by this mascara.",0
"This was a first for Two Faced lipstick. For years I only used gloss. But after receiving a free sample and loving the color I ordered it. Well the color is beautiful & matches my complection perfectly,but it leaves my lips feeling very dry. It also shows up all my nasty creases, thus the need for a primer and a gloss on top. Too much work, especially when traveling. I'm going back to glosses. ",4
"This was a great collection. I bought it for my daughters birthday and she loves it. The samplers were all a good size, the packaging was sophisticated and the products were high quality with a great variety to determine what you want to purchase full size. It is fun for her to have different mascaras for school, going out etc. I am buying one for me! ",3
"This was a hit for my friend's daughters.They are 10 and 13 yrs old. I picked them up a few things from Sephora girls and they were obsessed with everything. The makeup is sheer and glittery. Very fun for younger girls who want to play dress up & make up. The makeup was easy to remove and it did not irritate thier skin or eyes. I wish they had this stuff when I was younger, LOL ",2
this was a pretty decent hairspray and i use and love other ojon products but the scent is highly offensive (much stronger than the other ojon products) it isn't worth it because your hair actually ends up smelling like doggy doodoo and it doesn't fade either. my son and husband actually thought one of us had stepped in the above when i used it and we went to church and out to eat.YUCK! ,3
"This was excellent at removing make-up...but only if it was lighter make up. It takes about 2-3 cotton balls per eye if you wear eye liner or brighter colored eyeshadow. I was upset to find that it was also a little greasy. If you wash your face as soon as your done with this product, then it's okay. It does take off earth tone eye color pretty fast though! Plus it smells wonderful.",0
"This was finally the product I had been waiting to try, Cause I'm picky, a lens-wearer and I'm not easily impressed. It's decent, it had a great look and cool appearance and makes you think ahh... in one sweep.. No it takes more than one swipe and it's really cold! Worth the try.Always. ",2
"This was my absolute must-have sunblock of the summer. No big bottles to carry, no spills, no messes, just pure simple sunblock! I wore this under the crisper (aka-Grecian Sun) and didn't get burned. Applying it was just as easy as applying any facial powder! ",0
"This was my first BLISS purchase and WOWZA, was I impressed! I love the Orange scent which is not strong but you can definately smell it good. It definately smells nice & Orange-y. It makes the skin nice and soft. I liked it so much I got more for stocking stuffers! ",3
"This was my first GHD purchase, I love the dryer and all the products that came with it. The kit arrived about 3 weeks ago and I have been using it ever since. The small size of the dryer makes it easy to use, it drys my hair just as fast as my old one and leaves my hair shiny and soft. I liked these products so well, I've also purchsed one of the GHD stylers. I always wondered how those girls (and you know the ones I'm referring to) always look so perfect and now I feel I have found their secret. ",4
"This was my first time purchasing SmashBox lip gloss and I love them.They are very moisturizing there not sticky at all, lightly pigmented, Smell and taste great. The only downer about them is the gloss doesn't last that long on your lips. ",0
"This was my first time trying this product so I ordered the smallest jar in case I did not like it. First of all the smell is not that bad, it smells like pine needles and it goes away a little while after you put it on. It glides on smooth and spreads quite a ways. It does seem to make my skin kind of more vibrant. The only thing I did not really like about it is that it does not moisturize my skin as much as I would like. Although it is wintertime now and my skin is much drier now than in the summertime, this may be a good summer moisturizer. I think it is a good product but I have not used it long enough to see if it helps with fine lines or anything like that, hopefully it does.",0
"This was my introduction to Bare Escentuals. Actually I was in Sephora and told one of the associates of my quest for the perfect foundation and she said ""you gotta try this."" I was skeptical, but when she tried it on me in the store, I was pretty impressed. So I bought the kit and even watched the DVD (which I ordinarily wouldn't do). I highly recommend watching the DVD -- I picked up a lot of tips. If you haven't tried BE yet, DO IT -- you'll love it! I'm buying this kit for my daughter for Christmas -- she has rosacea and this would be perfect for covering those occasional red blotches. ",4
"this was my second primer purchase after buying smashbox's primer. i agree that it mattes the face and evens out small lines in the face, but my oily complexion really didn't work well with this at all. ",2
"This was my very first Philosophy purchase. I am 47 years old and have found my fountain of youth. So with that, at this stage of my life I had just about given up on that skin I used to have. I'm talking about that time where your skin gets dull,dry, and just no life to it, and then to top it off I live in a cold climate. Now after using this products my skin has been re-born, bright,tight and glowing. So I leave the house now Make-up Optional. THANK YOU. ",3
"This was one of my first purchases through Sephora.com, and I've used it every day since. I love this stuff! A little goes a long way, and it makes my hair feel nice, look silky and flyaway less. I'm not one for the flatiron fad, so the smoothing quality of this product is a ""lifesaver."" However, mostly I bought it as a ""hydrator,"" which it does perfectly too. ",2
"This was part of a facial I had with Ole Henriksen's Blue/Black Berry Enzyme Mask. Now, I was a little concerned with putting oil on my face as I have combination skin and was concerned about breakouts. That did not happen! My skin was left soft, smooth, clean, and conditioned. This mask/oil combination is a good one. ",4
"This was really fun to try and easy to use, I was surprised how effective a little powder can be as a concealer! Love the packaging and the brush. This is so much quicker to put on than regular concealers. ",3
This was recommended to me by an associate as I checked out and I said sure---what a great buy! I've already gotten another. I'm in my 50's and my lashes aren't quite what they used to be--but look fabulous with this product. I have tried EVERYTHING and settled for an OK one---then came Smoky Lash. I finally have lashes that can be seen and lasts without the racoon thing going on in a 1/2 hour. Four Thumbs up for this product.,4
"this was so pretty. The texture was beautiful & it went on great. It left a luminous glowy look, but was just a little to pinky for my skin. I usually like more of a bronzy glow, but wanted to try something different. ",3
"This was the first ""grown-up"" perfume I bought, and I keep coming back to it when I go to choose which fragrance I want to wear to work. The combination of scents is unlike anything else I've smelled, and it lasts all day - seriously! Unlike other perfumes, the scent doesn't change as the day wears on, but it rather remains consistent over time. It's musky but fruity at the same time, and the two complement pleasantly. It just embodies the attitude of a confidently seductive woman. Careful, though - only a couple of sprays is enough, as too many are indeed overwhelming. ",0
This was the first time I tried this cosmetics brand. It arrived in the cutest llittle bag and so far all of the products are working just fine. I can recommend this set to anyone who wants to try out this brand. ,3
"This was the greatest way to try Peter Thoman Roth's products and I love them. The cleanser was nice, but the best part was the day and evening moisturizers and the eye cream. Roth's products only require a little dab, so you don't need large clunky bottles. I've had mine for 2 weeks and I still have plenty. The nighttime moisturizer is absolutely the best I've ever used. This is something everyone who travels should get. You won't need to pack anything else! ",4
This WATERPROOF eye makeup remover is ok. It does not get rid of all my waterproof mascara which was the whole purpose of me buying it. Sure it doesn't irritate my eye but still I don't want left over mascara on my eyes. Not cool ,0
"This wears EXTREMELY well. I will spray it in the morning and go to bed still smelling in my hair. The notes are spicy, but mellow and they remind me of fall: almond, caraway, exotic wood...it's delicious. I wish that they still carried the body lotion, I loved layering the two together. I hope that this fragrance doesn't disappear any time soon. I'm thinking of making it my signature scent, all year 'round, I get so many compliments on it: from both males and females. It takes a lot for strange men to compliment you now-a-days...am I right, or am I right ladies?!",0
"This will be my new must-have. I received more compliments with this color than any other, it's a great rich red without being to overbearing. Since it's a stain, the color doesn't feather. I have also used the stain under other red lipsticks to make their color last longer with much success. ",2
"This will be my scent for life! I absolutely LOVE this fragrance and anyone that smells it on me subsequently goes out and buys it. The subtle yet rich notes make this the perfume that causes people to ask ""can I ask what you're wearing?"" Part of me doesn't want to reveal it so it can remain my own little treasure, but I always tell so other people can enjoy it. Its inconspicuous but present, just the way I imagined my dream fragrance would be! Cannot imagine ever changing perfumes. Ever.",0
"This will make a beautiful smokey eye. I like the sponge tip applicator, but it works fine with a thin smudge brush, too. Goes on so smooth, I don't bother wetting. Only takes a tiny amount, so check on a tissue, before applying. Gives that true khol look, without looking heavy. Love it! Will defintely buy again. ",3
"This works great for my sensitive, combination skin. This is just perfect in the spring and summer for me. And 30 SPF?! In your moisturizer?! That's amazing, you should be buying this just for that benefit. It's very hydrating but doesn't leave me all greasy. I do go for something thicker in the winter, but otherwise I can't go without this.",1
"This works pretty well for eyeliner if you don't want your liner to be too dramatic. I wear it in the day time to make my eyes stand out, yet not have them be too dramatic. I have worn this giving my toddlers a bath and getting splashed in the face and it does not come off, smear, or smudge. ",0
"This works surprisingly well. You'd expect something super-minty would be the only thing strong enough to work against bad breath, but this subtley sweet spritz does the trick. The price is the only thing that I'm iffy on. Because of that, I only use it when I'm out with friends. The case is really nice too. TIP: I tend to keep it in my mouth after a spritz for at least a minute to let it ""soak through"" and do its work instead of swallowing it right away. (I know the sweetness is tempting.) ",0
"This would be a great introductory kit for anyone to try Bare Escentials. The colors are lovely, on the warm side. It would be a wonderful starter kit for a young teen. All the product sizes fit beautifully into a purse. ",4
"this would be the best perfume ever, what with the vanilla and caramel (which i LOOVVEE!!)!!!! but when you wear it, kind of gives you the essence of a sticky little kid who was in a candy shop...can you say EEWWW!!!!!",1
"Thought I'd get these as stocking stuffers and try a couple myself. Colors were nice but it seems like there is a very small amount of actual color in the tube, the brush applicator is long so it makes it dificult to apply and then the color seems to dry on the brush even with the cap on. Won't purchase again. ",4
Thought it would stain my lashes so that you can see the ends of the lashes on the days when I don't want to wear mascara. Was disappointed - it is clumpy and messy if you aren't careful and if you make a mistake - oh no! Even make up remove doesn't fully take it off. ,3
"Thought my usual moisturizer was enough until I added this feather-light smoother. It weighs nothing, feels like silicone?, and does not clog pores. Makes bare minerals glide on with no oily or dry spot changes and seems to actually hold in the moisturizer I use longer. Great product!",4
"Tiny lines appear diminished and coverage is moderate and natural looking (smells beautiful too). I wish it came in a bottle. I tried using the brush but it was awkward and the results not as effective for me as just clicking the product out to stroke once over nose, forehead, cheeks and chin and then blending as usual. ",3
"Tiny pot, primer is very hard to get out of the pot, it is extremely sticky, doesn't apply but sticks to finger or brush instead, look's awful. Usually I love Sephora brand, but this one I am returning. ",2
"To add a bit more color easily to your lids, use this brush. It allows for less brush dipping into the shadow to get a more pigmented color on your lips. It also allows for precise definition of eyes. The bristles are soft and the brush is quality-made. ",2
"To be honest, at the price point of this mascara, I was expecting something a little nicer. I had problems with clumping, and didn't get much volume. It did have wear well throughout the day (it comes off most easily with waterproof makeup remover).",0
"To keep my eye shadow on all day without creasing and keep my lipstick on my lips with out sneaking into the little lines around my mouth, this is the great begining to my makeup routine........I can't live without it! ",4
"To me, it smelled too sweet for my taste. However, coworkers commented how nice it was and asked what I was wearing... I was surprised, because i really didn't care for it. So I guess it is one of those fragrences that you wear for others rather than yourself. ",3
"Too Faced is a fantastic brand, and I love most of their products, but I was sadly disappointed by the mascara. Instead of giving me the long, thick full lashes I desired, it just sort of came out clumpy and too thick. Instead of coating my lashes evenly, I ended up with the dreaded ""spider lashes"", and it tended to flake off, too. ",1
Top of the line!!!!! No streaking or creasing. Flawless color and beautiful appearance. There is one color in the palette which is a deep brick that I could use all by itself but it's a great collection. ,4
"totally awesome, i got it w/my bare minerals starter kit. i am a fair skinned asian...not white but not tan, the 'amber' shade is just perfect on me. not too sticky either, the texture is just right and it has the perfect amount of shine. good gloss for day and night. cant wait to try the other shades.",1
"Touche eclat is not really a magic wand! It does come very close. It is not a concealer per se but by a magical process akin to ""smoke and mirrors"" it draws attention to areas you add a touch of light to and in doing so averts the eyes from areas you choose not to draw attention to....Make your nose appears longer, thinner, highlight under your eyes, not concealing but using light and pigment to cause that area to lighten up. When your eyes seem wider apart, your nose as you wish it would be, your eyes more open, your upper lip clean and clear, your face looks luminous and this is not commercial on TV talk this is the real thing. It is not oxygen, food or water, but it is one tool of the trade you will find easy to acquire a skills set for quickly and grow to appreciate more each day. Trust me, all this takes is 5 minutes and you can feel free to layer over it again. All this time saved leaves you time and energy to develop your inner self, who cannot love the light?",4
Tremendous opportunity to try high end make-up and brushes at a great price. Beautiful quality all around and will buy full size products. Great to be able to sample products before major investment is made. ,4
"Tried Ojon Hydrating Thickening Shampoo & Conditioner in a sample kit; liked it enough to order it in the huge size. Adds just enough moisture to my fine curls to keep 'em curly and plumps up volume, too. Nice smell is a bonus--very fresh and light. ",2
"Tried the lipstick and found it to be too drying. There are many other lip lines at Sephora that won't give your lips that chapped, dry feeling. Just ask a consultant for help. They're always willing to suggest great products! ",4
Tried this product because I loved the Bionic so much so I thought I would try some more from Smashbox. I was very dissapointed. I spent the day wiping mascara from below my eyes as it ran all day. Not to mention the remover didn't work either. Definetly not worth the money. ,1
"True colors, creamy texture with smooth, easy application. Genuis packaging! I love the pots with clear lids. I can see what I'm picking up without having to find my glasses to read small print or open up the case to check on color. I have several colors and love them all. ",4
"True to the essence is an understatement! Every one is exact to the flavor! I love this one for my Christmas feelings! The mint is such an aromatherapy pick me up and this one is so much fun! Definitely my fave of them all (for now!) For the price, the ultimate stocking stuffer or hostess gift! ",2
"Truly the best blush I've ever tried. I've used a couple of the lighter shades, both are very flattering with a subtle shimmer. They're also nice and sheer, so instead of looking too made-up you just end up looking lovely!",2
"Truly the best of the best. Amazing Grace is such a clean, womanly scent that will have people telling you ""so smell so good"" and paired up with the creamy body emulsion you cannot go wrong. Also the cleanser is so gentle and removes all your makeup. The moisturizer is the only one out there that does not make my normally oily skin feel greasy. Just love it! And its a great price too! ",1
trust me i am one of those people who does not really care for the smell of roses but i love this it is a different kind of rose a simply divine one. the only kind i want my man bringing into my house! to have it on your body is to have delight lavished over your skin simply lovely!!! oooo yes you will love to l;ove it ,0
"Try new colors, new looks because with this super value Sephora pencil in a rainbow of shades you can! The pencil is creamy, blendable and smudgeable... set with a little powder shadow or loose powder because it will smear a bit... but hey, it's just $4! ",4
"turkish delight is one of my all time favorite glosses. i also have stollen kisses, but it is a bit too dark for me. the gloss goes on very smoothly and wears well. i refuse to spend this much money for a color i dont particularly like, so my remedy is to mix stolen kisses with a really light gloss and it works very well. ",2
Twist product into brush. While good in concept the product once in brush make the brush unusable to spread the product as I was not able to find a way other than use a sponge to spread the product once on face. ,3
"two coats of this mascara makes me look like i have on falsies. granted, my lashes are thick to begin with, so i can see how someone with puny thin lashes can think it makes spider-eyes * this mascara brush is so fat that it coats every lash and the formula is so thickening it makes movie star lashes.* the trick to a volumized, spider-free look is in the application: start at the very base of the lash and wiggle, then brush out to the ends.

Two Faced Tanning Bed In A Tube for your face is the absolute best. If you keep using it you can gradually get tanner. If you make a mistake it's easy to get off. I recently had skin cancer on my face and now Two Faced is the only product I use. The Very Best of the Best. ,4
Two of my favorite colors are Crazed and Orgazm. My cousin was wearing Crazed and after seeing her wear it a few times I had to know the color...it is very natural looking and gives a kissed been out in the sun look. This is a great color to wear everyday especially in the summer.,1
"Two outstanding things about this lipgloss; a generous container (still have some left & I've had this a while -also stays fresh inside the tin), and this is the softest, slickest, feel-good gloss I have ever worn. Only wish it would stay on longer (but on the other hand, it feels so good going on I don't mind re-applying). ",4
"UDPP has achieved cult status for good reason. While it's too sheer to even out the skin tone on your lids, it does what it's designed to do magnificently, i.e., it allows you to achieve a smoother/more even application of eye shadow color, prevents the color from accumulating in the crease, and ""holds onto"" the color until you remove your makeup. It can get a bit clumpy after a while with dried bits if you use the built-in foam-tipped applicator, but if you use a brush to apply it you get a perfect, even application. (Just get some product on the foam tip and wipe your brush across it.) Love this!!! ",3
UD's Primer Potion is one of my favorite things. For Christmas I give this to all the women in my life and they can't wait to get it! It is a reasonably priced product and works wonders. We all have fallen in love again with eye shadow because of this product! It doesn't get any better than that. ,2
"Undressed Beige and White Light Disco are the perfect bases for either a brown smokey eye or a black smokey eye, respectivly. When worn with no other eye shadow either of these colors leave eyes looking radiant! ",1
"Unfortunately nothing vanishes pores, but this stuff definitely soaks up the oil and keeps the shine away. Give it a week or so and the shine will stay gone all day every day - I never even have to use powder during the day. I tried switching to a few other brands - just tried the samples, but within days my face was so oily and shiny. Nothing compares to this, nothing at all!",2
"Unfortunately these two products didn't do a thing for me. I tried several times to see if there was a difference by wearing the eyeliner on one eye only,or the lip liner on top or bottom lip only. I could never tell a difference. ",4
"Unfortunately, this did not work for my very sensitive, breakout-prone skin. It smells and feels great but the small amount of fragrance and the product itself seemed to irritate my problem skin. I would not recommend it for those with extremely sensitive skin.",1
"Unlike other primers, I like how this one was so silky and absorbed into my lids right away. Your lids will not feel heavily made up at all. It is seriously an eye makeup magnet and will keep your eyes creaseless and smudge free. I used it on vacation in hot, humid weather and my makeup did not budge! ",0
"Unlike the kohl pencil, this liner does not smudge. It goes on smooth and stays on until you take it off. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it does not sharpen in a standard sharpener. I will have to go back to the store for a sharpener that works with it. It would be great it this came in a ""self-sharpening"" model or with a built in sharpener at the other end. ",3
Unlike the other Philosophy 3 in 1's this is not a conditioner. But it is a great shampoo and bubble bath. Beware - I totally find myself craving a Cherry Coke after using it. Brings out a smile in the morning. ,2
"Until I found this, I've never worn lipstick because it was too dry. However, this feels creamy and moist. In addition, I thought that most colors would be too dark for my extremely pale (with blue undertones) skin. However, I love the sheerness of ""Party Crasher"" and ""Breathless"" as well as my favorite, ""Dessert First"". This is the only lipstick for me! ",2
Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencils are awesome. I just love the colors as i use them to highlight and color contrast my eyes. I get lots of compliments on them. They glide on hence the name and stay on well. I highly recommend this product.,2
"Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion does exactly what it is supposed to do; it keeps your eyeshadow on your lid all day, without creases. I especially like that it allows the actual color of your shadow to show on your lids. The only reason that I did not this product an ""excellent"" rating is because the applicator wand does not apply the primer well and often leaves it clumpy and uneven on your lids - though, it's nothing that a quick finger can't fix. This magic primer potion is a must for all shadowers. ",2
"Urban Decay has quite a variety of colors and types of shadows to work with. It's quite a pleasure to be able to decide when you want to shimmer, shine, be matte or sparkle if thats your thing. Alot of companys don't have the variety or the choice of colors, and some businesses need the choice. ",3
"Urban Decay is my favorite brand from Sephora and was so excited to find this palette! I love the combination of bright colors and everyday ones too. They blend well and go on smoothly, not to mention how long they last. It's also a great value! It's what introduced me to the Eyeshadow Primer, my absolute favorite! I use this almost everyday and would recommend it to anyone. ",0
"Urban Decay may be well-known for it's eyeshadow primer (Primer Potion), but for me - I can't say enough about their 24/7 Glide-on pencils! We all know how important it is to prevent tugging around your eye area! Well, this is the ONLY pencil that I trust around my delicate eyes. And, I can easily line, define, & shade to my heart's content because the colors are incredibly vibrant! And baby - it's not going anywhere - it'll stay until you take it off!",2
Urban Decay's Blow Lip Plumper definitely gets the job done. It is tingly before turning your lips numb and the plump lasts longer than any other lip plumper I've tried so far. It's not as expensive as a lot of others I've tried either. Definitely worth giving a try! ,2
"Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion delivers its promise. Having tried a multiitude of eyeshadow primers, I can honestly say this is the best one I have ever used. My shadow remains in place without getting streaked, lined, or creased. Amazing! ",4
Urban Decay's eyeshadows are the absolute best and the matte eyeshadow is no exception. It is highly pigmented and stays put without creasing. This eyeshadow goes on silky smooth and is super blendable. Great eyeshadow! ,2
Urban Decay's Ultraglide lip gloss is definitely super-shiny. I like to wear it over lipstick because it's a little too sheer for me and it works very well over lipstick. It has staying power and it's moisturizing. It's not overly sticky either. Very nice gloss. ,2
"Urban Decay's XXX gloss is super-shiny without being overly sticky. The ""Quickie"" color is beautiful worn alone or over pink lipstick as well. It's moisturizing and long-lasting, too. Excellent lip gloss. ",2
"Use a light touch, and if you want to look natural but nicer, this is the best powder type make up I have tried. I don't plan to use anything else. minerals make me break out. This doesn't but if you want it to last all day, a primer helps. Great product. ",3
used this product and it was quite expensive. It seemed to work well but the can did not give more than one use. When I went to use it a second time it was empty and no one else lives in the house.... ,3
"Use it every night and wake up with non-oily skin that has much more of a glow than before. Excellent moisturizer that is light weight and is easily absorbed. My skin definitely looks better, especially around the eye area where skin gets dry. ",4
"Use this root plumping shampoo to thicken hair that needs to be shaved, so it's easier for the razor to grab hold! The smoothness makes for a wonderful feel on shaved legs! Not to mention a great shampoo! ",2
"Usually all mascara formulas tend to be more or less the same, except for this one. It's really different. It works too. It's the only mascara that doesn't drive out quickly or clump and smudge. Amazing stuff ",0
"Usually when purchasing a ""quad"" of something, be it eyeshadow or lip color, you can expect one or more duds that aren't used as much as the others. Not so with the ""plum seduction' quad I purchased by Clinique. ALL of the colors are great, you can use them individually or blend them, wet or dry, you're always assured of a lovely result. ",3
"Usually with a colored lipgloss you have to use a under color lipstick for it to really show. Not with this stuff, it's really that color and its great. it's dark and gothic and i love it. I just wish it came in different colors and that it wasn't a limited time item. ",1
"Variety is truly the spice of life, and that's what Philosophy's Classic Cookbook provides. Depending on the weather and my mood, I can select a shampoo-shower gel to match. The quality of this product is also exceptional. Thank you, Philosophy, and kudos to you, Sephora, for carrying this product. ",4
"VERA WANG OUTDONE HERSELF WHEN CREATING THIS SCENT! VERY LIGHT, ELEGANT, SUBTLE, SOFT, AND EXTREMELY FEMININE!! I SWEAR, I GOT OVER 21 COMPLIMENTS PASSING THROUGH MACY'S WHEN I SPRAYED THIS ON MY SHIRT! EVERYONE (EVEN THE COSMETIC COUNTER) ASKED ME WHAT I HAD ON! I KNOW SCENTS, AND COLLECT FOR A LIVING, BUT THIS ONE....""THIS IS THE ONE"". ",1
"Very black and makes your lashes look soft and full. Comparable to Benefit's Bad Gal Lash, except it is better at staying all day rather than smudging slightly under the lash line. I wish it was slightly cheaper but it is overall a great produc that I recommend. ",0
"Very gentle, easy to use. Although it removes even the toughest waterproof mascara, it won't damage your delicate eyelashes. Also, it doesn't leave a harsh residue that irritates lids. Really nice product, not heavily scented, either.",3
"Very good, always amazed how this company puts out great products for less money, this item is great, it does even out the complexion, I should know because my skin type varies allot in its degree of color, and impurities. ",4
"Very good glossing product. It does make my hair shine, and helps with fly-aways and I also like that it does not make it oily and is very light. The only problem I have with it is the odor...not a bad odor at all but it is very noticable. I find that if I wear perfume, it overpowers the scent that I'm wearing. If it weren't for the odor, I would give 5 stars. ",3
Very moisturizing. Apply alone and have nice glossy moisturized lips. Cannot believe this is only a Sephora product and not from some high end line. Makes the lipstick last much longer too when applied over it. Throwing out all my other lip balms and this one is the one. ,2
"Very natural looking. I'm blonde and have very light eyebrows, so usually brow pencils look far too dark (and fake) on me, but the blonde pencil works great for me. I love the brush on the end too, it helps blend the pencil so it looks even more natural.",1
"Very nice and does not clump on your lashes. I was happy that it was available in brown as some products only come in black, which can be a bit harsh. This was the first time I had purchased it so we shall see as time goes on if I will repeat.",4
Very nice light bronze color. I have fair skin and it just gives me a natural glow. Moisturizing also. Compared to Smashbox body tint at $35. This is much better and goes on creamier. Highly recommend. ,3
"very odd consistency for a conditioner; it is translucent and looks more like a shampoo. but matched with the Apple Cider Clarifying Shampoo, it moisturizes absolutely without weighing down my fine hair. I find if I use it as a deep conditioner, i.e. towel dry then apply it, and put on a plastic cap, it penetrates much better. it rinses very clean, and is a nice break for my hair from heavier conditioner. a good, twice a week volumizing conditioner. ",2
"Very pretty and makes your lips look smooooth and hence, full. But, the color, love ya, was much too barbie-ish against my olive skin. It was very light and hard to wear. I don't love the metallic sheen all the colors have. Didn't feel tingle or anything uncomfortable, did last a while too. I would reccommend these but you gotta make the color work in your own way. ",1
"Very reasonable price for a product that does all that; but does it? Over 2 wks in (I know, can't expect results overnight) but considering all the cheaper OTC ingredients are listed first, the ingredients you need most are near the end - plus 3 parabens! Moisture - yes, anything else - so far NO ",4
"Very shiny, not sticky, doesn't try out lips! Great for a polished look in no time. Goes on great with or without color underneath! So if you don't wanna put lipstick/lip color on this is a great trick to use.",0
"Very soapy-type fragrance. Perfect to layer under the Pure Grace Body Lotion to enhance its longevity. Great fragrance to wear anywhere, including work,. Since it smells like soap, it's non-offensive. Too bad there isn't a perfumed body powder of this fragrance. ",3
"Very true to the scent of the original fragrance, great for layering; the lotion has a nice, light texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving a very subtle golden shimmer. Too expensive and glimmery for everyday use as an allover body lotion, but a luxurious little highlighter for eveningwear and special occasions! ",2
Very unhappy with the product due to the smell. It to me has NO smell at all...the product as a shower gel is okay but I'm veru disappointed especially since other Philosophy products are so very good! ,4
"Vincent Longo makes the best lipsticks around. Period. I use the ""twisted petal"" color and it is just a tad darker than my own lip color. It just give my face a natural , but prettier look. Which is how I like to wear my makeup some days. Expect great things from these lipsticks. They are long wearing, non-drying, and really creamy. ",1
"Want to add warmth and color to your cheeks? Then reach for Taj Mahal and smile pretty! It's a burnt orange shade infused with flecks of gold that leaves you with a simple, subtle glow. The pigment is rich and a little goes a long way, so use it lightly and add more if needed. I suggest using a fan brush to apply for precise application.",1
"Warning... once you try this you will be hooked. I use this product every morning when I get out of the shower. It smells so good, and preps my face for the moisturizer and sunscreen I throw on top of it. My pores look smaller, and my face glows. It does so much without irritating my sensitive skin. Such a great product.",1
"was sorry i choose the wrong color but none the less, the makeup is great, i just try to use less or mix with other makeup. will definetly buy again but different shade. i have to use a liquid and this goes on so nicely. all i have to say is Finally thanks ",4
"was very pleased with the fast delivery. This is a wonerful product, a great moisturizer. I also love ghd elevation shampoo and conditioner but am disappointed that I have not been able to purchase on line and recently it has not been available in the store. It's a great product, please stock it again. Thanks ",4
"We know it's not right, but we do it anyway. I, myself, am NOTORIOUS for falling asleep in my makeup. Our prayers have been answered with this product: no soap, no sink, no water necessary. I literally keep the large size right on my night-stand next to my bed. That, and a big pile of cotton pads. Simply wet a cotton pad and wipe until all the residue is removed! Voila! It's perfect for removing stubborn mascara and eyeliner. No more messy pillow cases! (It's a nice convenience, but should not replace regular cleansing for the whole face...I tried that once and I broke out from continued usage. You CAN, however, use it everyday as your eye and face makeup remover, just follow with your regular cleanser). ",0
"Well, Britney did it again: She created another amazing perfume! I have every single one of her fragrances and this one lived up to the rest of them! She beautifully blended different ingredients to create a sensual, yet feminine scent. The tart smell of citrus, the elegant smell of flowers and the intriguing smell of amber create one breath-taking fragrance! I can't wait to see (and buy) what she comes out with next! ",0
"Well, finally someone after my own heart sat down and figured out a way to save me some moolah! I try every mascara that comes down the pike and this was one heck of a way to try 10 of them for $3.50 each. When you think of how much the cost of one tube of mascara can be nowadays, this is a great bargain. And between you and me, don't tell Sephora (oopsie, think I'm about to) but some of these mascaras are lasting way more than I think they figure they will. Thanks, Sephora! ",3
"Well I thought these would be bigger. I knew they would be small, but the thing is they are smaller than my index finger (And yes I have normal hands) they are thin too. I bought this product alone online with the 15 dollars off coupon sephora was offering. I paid in total 43.77 with tax and shipping. I was very disappointed and got ready to get the return envelope but then I decided to try it out. They work amazing. They glide on very well, so soft and smooth. I used to use khole eyeliners because they were smooth, but this is way better. I use eyeliner every day, so I don't think this was a good investment for the black eyeliner. However, I only use colored eyeliner once in awhile, and if you too this is good to buy. Its less then buying them all separate at full size. I decided to keep this kit only for because of the colored eyeliner, which btw is brilliant and very nice. I am ordering the full size black however. ",0
"WELL ITS TRUE...PEOPLE ACTUALLY TELL YOU THAT ""YOU SMELL SO GOOD"". LEAVES YOUR SKIN SOFT AND GENTLY SENTED WITH THIS FABULOUS FRAGRANCE. WORKS GREAT ON COLOR TREATED HAIR, LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGABLE!!! PHILOSOPHY KNOWS WHAT IT IS DOING WHEN IT COMES TO FRAGRANCE AND SKIN CARE....THIS IS SO FEMININE, IT GIVE YOU A FEELING OF COMFORT...AN AROMATHERAPY EXPERIENCE.....TRY IT YOU WON'T BE SORRY......",4
"Well, my title pretty well sums it up! I love the convenience of putting this in my purse and not having to worry about spillage. The size is just perfect. The smell is so clean and fresh. They are not kidding about smelling like you just came out of the shower! ",4
"Well, when trying new products one never really knows what to expect. I would have preferred this in Black, but only Brown was offered. I decided to give it a try. I have to say that I needed to apply several more coats than what I am accustomed to in order to achieve the look I was satisfied with. And, even then, I would say that this mascara is ideal for day-wear; it is very natural looking with not alot of ooomph! If planning a night out on the town, I would reach for another mascara. Still, I did not find this product to be clumpy, as others have mentioned. It was smooth...just required numerous coats. ",3
"We love the Bliss Balm and use it every night - I put in on my and my husband's hands, put it around my eyes and lips. What we have noticed is that my husband's hands that would normally be chapped and already have one or two splits at the fingertips are perfect. My hands are also very soft and the area around my lips and eyes are hydrated. This is a wonderful product that you use for your personal needs. ",3
Went in to the store one day and one of the sales people helped me with selecting some foundation - she used this brush as a finishing and it felt so good I had to buy it. Does great job and feels silky on the face - it makes you feel so relaxed because of the soft touch!!! ,4
We so often forget to protect this skin if iour lips and this is a great product to do so. Your lips will feel moisturized and have a gentle wash of color with this. An added bonus is the hint of mint scent. ,3
What a Brush!! What a Mascara. I have spent tons of money on expensive Mascara's only to have them dry out way to fast and no matter what the brush it gummed up like a gummy bear but NO MORE Here's an amazing mascara you can actually put on with ease. Love my long Bent lashes!! ,3
"What a feel-great product! It made my lips softer and smoother than any other lip balm product or lipstick I have tried. Our sun here in Hawaii can damage unprotected lips, but this product protects and softens with color too! ",3
"What a great idea...carrying around the bare esc. pods are out of the question, so ;I love this ON THE GO idea. THe downside is that the product flys everywhere and gets all over you. You have to use this in the bathroom over the sink while bending forward so that all of the fllying product goes in the sink and not all over YOU. If used in that way, it is great. Do NOT use in the car, as you will end up with Mineral Veil all over your lap and car. So it is a good item if used properly. ",3
"What a great product! I have a few palettes from Kat and highly recommend them. I like to use a combination of complimentary, coordinating shades at the same time to make a beautiful statement with my eyes. I got the idea from the videos and how to's on the Sephora website. Kat Von D's palettes make it easy to do. She picks great eyeshadow combinations to put together in one kit. No more buying numerous shades to do one job. It's all put into one kit. Everything about the palette is well thought out. Even the package makes you feel like you have just bought something very special. Easy to apply and stays put. Comes with two eyeshadow brushes and a mirror in the case. Kat Von D knows what makeup a woman wants and does it with style! ",3
What a great product! I love that I can use this all over my body and not have to use different products. The scent is not overpowering and it made my skin and hair look and feel refreshed. I give this out as gifts. Wonderful.,1
What agreat scent!!!!!! Its subtle but yet present when it counts. This lotion is just right for this weather and its a great scent for those of you who dont like scented lotions that are overwhelming. Thanks Philosophy.,3
"What a great value for the money! Although some of the colors look very dark in the containers, they are lovely on the skin. I usually wear neutral colors so these will be my party colors. They are very rich in tone and in the way they go on. They are very high quality. This set really has a lot of good products for a ridiculously good price. ",4
What a great way to try all the different brands - I just hate to find out I get racoon eyes after having spent $$$ on a product I cannot return. I wish I had purchased several. The size is great and you always have fresh product. BRING IT BACK!!!! ,3
What a great way to try all the different mascaras! I am always intrigued by different ones and it is so fun to try them without having the expense of buying a full size. These are also soooo great for travel! I even let my daughters pick out a couple to try themselves. ,3
"What a luscious scent! It starts out slightly powdery, but I love this scent! It is sweet and zesty at the same time. It isn't too sweet like many scents I have smelled, though, and I would recommend this scent! ",1
What a terrific fragrance! It smells so delicious and inviting. When I wear it I can't help but feel like the most beautiful woman in the room. Plus the bottle itself is fun to look at. Great product all around. ,0
"What a wonderful product, I really like the way it smells, makes me feel very relaxed. Not a heavy scent, just right for me. I purchased (2) more, one for my daughter and one for my new daughter-in-law for Christmas. Excited about them trying for the first time.",4
What can I say? I love the light but penetrating scent. There's plenty of bubbles! I like using this along with the moisturizing lotion and the perfume oil for scent that lingers all day but never overwhelms.,3
"What can I say, it is the best. If you are still using a cheap tweazer run dont walk to the store and buy this. This tweezer cant be beat. The company offeres you free sharpening if you return it to them. I admit I have not taken them up on this offer yet. I usually just buy a new one. However one day I will get organized and send my old ones in for sharpening. Even dull they cant be beat. ",2
"What can I say? This product is great! I love how it's ergonomic, the bristles are soft, and it sets the powder on your face flawlessly! This may not be the absolute best brush I've ever used, but for the price and the results, you really can't complain! I'd definitely recommend picking one of these up if you haven't already done so! ",0
"What I like: Tricks of the Trade eyeshadow transformer lasts longer than any other liquid I've used to convert powdered shadow into eyeliner. It creates a soft line that's darker than the brushed-on powder itself, but the same tone, so no clashing. Its edge isn't harsh like a liquid liner, and you can blend it if you like, into the dry powder areas. And you always have the color you want-- For light-haired women, who like a more natural eye, this is a huge plus. What I don't like: drippy, takes some patience to learn how to mix the powder and the transformer, and apply it without crumbs of powder gunking up your line. Once you get it right, though, you get a soft, well-shaped, custom eye that lasts all day. ",3
"what's better than one silky, pigmented, beautiful Nars eye shadow? TWO Nars shadows, of course! I have Surbaya [among others, but I wish I had 'em all] which is simply gorgeous on brown eyes. having brown eyes, I tend to 'collect' every brown-toned eyeshadow I can find; and to my delight, Nars finds a way to create gorgeous new brown tones I've never seen before. every time I check, there are yummy new shades to try! wear the colors individually, or tap your brush into one color, then the other, to create a new look. when I first saw these duo shadows, I was surprised at the pairing of some of the colors. why would they put that with that? I wondered. an example would be Rated R, or Misfit. then I tested the colors together. Nars has intentionally paired complementary colors together- colors which are opposite one another on the color wheel- which, in their disparity, act to really punch up or pop the other. and, when combined, these seemingly mis-matched shades blend into new colors that will bring a new aspect to your look. they'll cause you to leave your comfort zone as you find yourself beguiled by a pale green, or a sunny yellow, that you wouldn't ordinarily wear. Rated R looks killer on blondes; the trick is in the blending. Misfit looked gorgeous on a red haired, brown eyed friend. Nars is a true artist, and his products reflect this, as they cause us to stop and see a product like eyeshadow in a completely new way. so while some colors look garish or strange, test them before you dismiss them. the lightest touch of one of these unexpected tones can transform your look from nice to sublime, without being overt. I love these shadows. non-creasing, incredibly concentrated, soft silky formula- you can feel how finely ground the pigments are. and just a tiny tap loads your brush with color. a truly superior eyeshadow, with colors for all skin tones and ages. ",2
"What's not to like? It smells lovely, but, yet, it's not an overpoweringly strong scent, either. This is something you wear, and instead of someone telling you that your perfume smells great, you are told that you smell great!",2
"What took me so long to realize that waterproof mascara was what I needed? Instead of having dark circles under my eyes, I have fantastic lash coverage that make my lashes look thick, long, and sexy. I'll never try any other mascara now that I've found Dior Waterproof mascara.",4
Whenever I use this fragrance I feel like I am clean and get the 'just stepped out of the shower' feel. It is a nice light scent and it lasts for a while. It is one of the better fragrances out there. If you are not sure what kind of perfume to get someone I can assure you this is one scent that will please every woman.,1
"When hair removal goes from good to bad to ugly becuse of hair bumps, Tend Skin is the product to use. It started alleviating the problem immediately and after a couple of days I was hair bump free. Now I use as directed to keep those ugly hair bumps away. ",4
"When I am regular about using this mask at least once a week I see such a difference in my skin. My pores are clearer (those pesky blackheads are gone!), which results in my skin looking brighter; read - younger. My skin is also softer. But remember I said once a week. And don't worry, those containers last a lot longer than you'd think. It really is a super facial you can do at home. ",2
"When I attempt to judge the 'value' of a kit, i do so with an eye towards what I all ready own, and what I really want/need. Most kits don't make the cut, as the stated value is based on brushes that I all ready own, and products in colors I won't use. This kit was a near exception. Yes, I own all of these brushes, but I wanted a small jar of Mineral Veil for my purse, had used Golden Gate Blush before , and knew that I liked it -- for eye shadow as well as blush, and wanted a gloss that color for my purse. The only unknown was the eye shadow: Joy. I don't think I'll ever use it alone, but when I mix it with some of my very dark colors, it works nicely. and this is the real value of BE products to me: loose powders are easy to custom-mix for endless new options, and the pigments used are safe for eyes as well as face, making these products a good value, over-all. ",3
"When I bought this brush, I wondered if I would ever really use it. Now, I don't know how I ever got along without it. I use it the blend eyeliner, and especially to apply and blend highlighting powder into my creases and lines and at the corner of my eyes. I love this brush. ",4
"When I bought this foundation, I was looking for something that was a little heavier that would cover all my freckles! Usually heavier foundation is thick and not as easy to blend, so when I first opened this, I was a little worried. For one thing, the foundation is almost liquid so I was sure I wouldn't get the coverage I needed. I was surprised at how well it covered and how easily it blended for being so thin. That resulted in a really comfortable wear. Not greasy, not cakey, not too heavy feeling. I was also worried because the bottle seems so small compared to other foundations. I've had this bottle since late June and I'm still working on it. A little goes a long way with this product. All it takes is one pea sized squirt for each side of my face and I'm done. It's very long lasting and makes my skin feel great. I love this foundation and I don't think I could ever wear anything else. ",1
"When I came across this scent, It was in my Sephora magazine. It was a sample and I instantly could smell it before I even opened the book. I immediately swiped through the pages to find that heavenly smell. I almost fainted with bliss it smelled so good. It even made my heart flutter a little bit, which is good especially when it comes to something I like. ",0
"When I first bought this product, I didn't really see the results that I immediately thought I would, or that it claims I would. However, after having changed my face wash I noticed when I apply this product (which is not everyday) I can see a difference. Not in the redness necessarily, but it does look calmer.",1
"When I first got this, it worked great! It really boosted my lash volume and length without making my lashes stick together. But after just a week, it seemed to not be working as well. Maybe it just doesn't work once it gets air in the tube? I did notice it drying out very quickly. ",0
"When I first heard of this product I was skeptical...then, I tried it & loved it!!! It goes on easy(just a little practice), it stays put, & the color combinations are incredible!! I have ColorOn Eye Envy in flaunt, tropics, exotic, & tinsel! I get more than one use from the appliques. If you try it, you, will love it, too!!! ",2
When I first opened it I was a little thrown off by the brush.. But once you use it the right way your going to love it!!! It's my favorite mascara it makes my lashes thicker and longer. If you use it wrong it will look clumpy but you can use a little wand and fix that. I just adore it. I'm still waiting for it to be on stock again. ,0
"When I first saw this collection quite a while ago, I thought it was something that I would never be interested in. Quite honestly, I can't remember what made me try it anyway and am I glad I did! The colors are beautiful! I am very fair with lots of freckles (age spots?) and light green eyes. I actually was concerned that these colors would be too much for me but they are berry attractive and much more subtle than I expected. They go perfectly with the reds we tend to wear during the holidays but at the same time are not overpowering. The total look is gorgeous and I love the Buxom lip gloss. ",4
"When I first smelled this fragrance I fell in love. Everyone else I came in contact with thought I smelled great, too. I received a lot of compliments. The one problem I had was I had to use a lot in order for it to stay on. It wears off after a couple hours or it seems to get very faint. If you are looking into buying this I would buy the larger of the sizes.",0
"When I first tried these I got the usual black, and wasn""t sure if I would keep it. I had problems with smearing and sprinkling down under my eye.(holding tissue under eye while applying solved that) I used a primer (Weather Everything?) and it was perfect. Now I have COLORS! A BUNCH! And use it wet/dry, as deep outer corner shadow for a dark, sexy eye. It doesn't irritate and lasts forever! You can control the depth by diluting it more for a softer look. A dry very light wash on lid makes a great shadow, then wet it and line. GREAT mixing with a Glimmer for an evening liner! Even fills in brows for a quick fix! Endless options! Makes great cat-eye liner look. ",4
"When I first tried this mascara, thought I loved it even more than the first Lash Injection! It really does hit all the lashes so cleanly. I have naturally thick lashes, but they are short, so I really need the lengthening component without overthickening --PinPoint does tackles the job which is GREAT! However, I have noticed some racoon action by the end of the day. ",2
When I first tried this product I wasn't sure I was liking it then a people started to ask me what I was doing differntly because I was looking so good. Now I won't use anything but this & Laura Geller's prodicts. I can leave the house knowing that I look good no matter how I feel. ,4
"When I first used this my hair was instantly shiny and healthy looking, my hair was shiny all day and I saw a few stares. This is must have for hair that needs shine and brightens up your colored locks. ",0
"When I first used this product, I thought it wasn't substantial enough. It almost felt like a liquid which wasn't what I expected it to be. Still, after a couple of applications, I really like it. The scent is gorgeous and it actually takes very little product to soften the lips and give them a little shine. Really nice. ",4
"When I go to the salon, they charge me 29 dollars for this glaze to seal my haircolor and add ""brilliant shine"". It works when the salon does it, when I purhcased this and applied it after shampooing, I honestly didn't see the ""dramatic difference"". I'm sure if I was loyal to the product it probably would've produced results cause it worked when I go to the salon giving me ULITMATE shine. ",1
"When i got this in my sephora order, it had melted outside the cannister. i was a little put off that it looked like a clear version of Crisco. i can't use this alone simply because it's insanely greasy; however, if i mix a small bit of this with my regular body lotion, it really makes my skin deliciously soft. i gave it 3 stars because of the greasiness factor. ",2
"When i learned HOW this stuff works, I stopped using...the ingredients (like pepper, etc) IRRITATE your lips (hence the intense stinging) and then you start to tingle and inflame the area slightly (a sign that blood is rushing to your lips to heal the area)....I can't imagine what this does over time as you beat your skin up over and over...I've decided I'll just use a good nude lip liner and high shine gloss to make my lips look juicy. ",1
"When I""m designing a vixen look for a fashion shoot I depend on the clean and flawless application of this perfectly intense lip liner. When creating these trendy purple and burgundy lipsticks looks the lips must be lined first with this professional grade lip liner in order to achieve a defined and refined finish.Essential for a sultry pout ! ",2
"When I read the description, I thought it was supposed to smell like a rootbeer float, but instead it smells just like plain rootbeer. I like rootbeer, but don't particularly care for this shower gel. If they had added an ice cream scent to it, I think I would have liked it better. This is one of the first Philosophy shower gels I have returned to the store. ",3
"When I saw this, I just had to have it. My son bought it for me for Christmas. The packaging brought me back to the wonder of the dancing ballerina in my jewelry box. I agree with those who were disappointed that there were no brushes, but, hey, don't we all have them anyway? The colors are vibrant, which just means that you can go light or heavy, depending on where you are going. Love this kit! ",2
"When I spray this, I smell vanilla, raspberry, cedar, & musk. I guess you can say it's a woodsy and foody scent. I wear this in the fall & winter. It's not a hot/warm weather scent. The quality of this fragrance is wonderful. The scent stays true in the dry down and lasts a long time without being too overwhelming. The bottle is super adorable. ",2
When I travel this the is palate I carry with me. I add gold shadow and mascara and my eyes are done. The dark suede is a perfect liner. Moonstone is a nice highlighter. I don't care for the blush (to dark for me) but the eye shadows are terrific. ,4
"When i was in the sephora store I was really skeptical about this becuase it looked so tiny and i could buy a lot of other things for 32 dollars., but fortunately i decided to get it! And i must say i'm glad i got this and not some other expensive duo eye shadow or somehting. It looks like a little but it goes a long way! It has evrything you would need to prep your face into looking flawless. ",0
"When I wear Dior Forever people always comment on how great my sking looks and ask what my secret is! The shade is perfect (I have red hair and medium skin) and the wear claim holds true all day--no caking, smearing. Great! ",3
"When they discontinued my former favorite powder, Tony & Tina, I had to search for another one. I think I tried every brand on the market, including many of the highest-end brands, and finally I found Tarte and my search ended! This is a great powder - doesn't become cakey, controls shine without drying my skin, smooths imperfections and leaves a nice satiny, natural-looking finish. My only slight complaint is that my skin is so pale, even the lightest shade, Fair, is a little bit darker than I would prefer, but it is still so natural-looking that it gives me a tiny hint of color without looking phony. I also would like the compact to be a bit less bulky. But still, it is a superior face powder, love it!",2
"When you find something you really love, just stay with it, why mess with success. I am a blonde, brown eyes and medium complexion, this bronzer does the trick. Brings out the best in me. Have tried many, many others, but this in the one, it's great.",4
"When you walk into your doctor's office and the receptionists and nurses who come up to talk with you look up and say, ""Something really smells good--it's so fresh smelling!!"", it makes you feel really good about choosing Sugar Lemon. Then when the doctor comments that you smell good, you blush, but you love it anyway!\n\nThis is my very favorite scent now--I love a fragrance that is light and has a sweetness to it, without any musk. The more I wear it , the more compliments I get on it. I think all of us like that--knowing we made a good choice...knowing other people like the same things we do!...knowing that you smell fresh\n\nSugar Lemon should be number 1 your list of "" the very next fragrance I want to try!""",4
"where do I start? if you need sheer but strong hold- although this sounds like an impossible task for a hairspray- this product can do it. I have baby-fine, naturally curly hair that can frizz easily. and my hair is instantly weighed down by styling products, which I use in an attempt to build some volume. well, not only does this hairspray give me as much volume as I want, it doesn't turn my hair into a limp, crispy mess, which other sprays can do. nor does it dry out or damage my hair. the canister and the nozzle are well-designed and make application easy and controllable. if you want light hold, use a small amount. for an evening up-do, a tiny bit more. you will get hair that holds your style, and yet it never feels like you are 'wearing' hairspray. if only we'd had this back in the 80's! [-well, maybe that's a good thing...] but regardless, we have it now, and I for one won't be without it. ",2
"Whether giving or receiving a Sephora eGift Certificate, you just can't go wrong! Everything in the store is at your fingertips. It's so easy to order and send and even more fun to choose your beauty items! It's the perfect gift. ",3
"While DiorShow mascara is fantastic, there are others out there that do just as good of a job for a more reasonable price. As much as I am loving the product right now, when it is time for a new bottle, I will probably buy cheaper...... ",2
"While I agree that this gloss can be a bit ""tacky"" it does stay on for a long time... This color in particular is fabulous for the light lip/heavier eye nighttime look. My husband loved it. I think it would look good on every one! ",2
"while I am usually a veritable cheerleader for Make Up Forever products, I found Flash Color to be a bit difficult to work with. the formula is- just hard to control. the color I purchased, Carmine 1, looked like the perfect brown-red on the monitor but when it arrived it was a dark warm red. [this isn't MUF's fault, of course.] I think I need to work with this product. it would probably make a good colored cream eyeshadow base for a layer of powder shadow on top of it. it was just a little too oily for my shine-prone eyelids to use on its own. ",2
"While I do not care for the smell, it smells quite medicinal, it does work to minimize my pores. I use it along with Dr. Brandt's other poreless products, so my experience may be different than someone who used this product along with another brand. When used with the other poreless products, it works very well. ",2
"While I love many Stila products, this is best used under another foundation or mixed with another because for many gals, it can be a bit too much luminosity. I thought it took my light skin to beyond the pale in an unflattering way when used alone. ",4
"While I love Oscar Blandi's powder version of the dry shampoo, this is my favorite spray version. I actually start with this for an all-over zap of the greasies, and touch up with some of Blandi's powder, especially in my bangs, where my hair needs extra help. Other spray forms of dry shampoo run out crazy-fast, but this one has been serving me well for several weeks now. Definite repurchase. ",1
"While I love the Clarisonic Brush, I was very disappointed with this cleanser that came with it. This made a bunch of bumps just underneath the skin pop up within a day of use. Maybe it's meant for someone with much drier skin than I have. At any rate, I pitched it. Much better products out there. ",4
"while the colors are gorgeous, the formula is problematic. it is greasy and does not wear very long. the pencil tip squishes easily and sharpening it can get very messy. again, no big deal, as Nars makes so many fantastic lip products to choose from.",2
"While the formula isn't natural (I WISH ...I've been looking for a 100% natural lip stain) the shade of color it gives lips is natural. It isn't as nasty tasting as some other stains for the lips out there, has more of a gel base so it's easier to control. All in all a good product, with good staying power. Doesn't dry lips like some stains. ",1
"While there are lots of shadows, non are really high density. Sets generally don't offer the best quality and I found that only a few shadows were usable. The lip palette could have been better, too. I think that buying what you like separately is still a better value! ",4
"While this has the potential to be a good product overall, it is expensive for the quantity, and the rollerball tends to stick. I have to tap this several times on my hand to get the thing unstuck. It sticks even if recapped immediately after usage, probably due to the sticky consistency of the product. In fairness, it does not take a lot of product to create a film layer over the affected area, so maybe it will last long enough to be worth the price. ",4
"While this is a very nice eye cream in terms of skin smoothing and hydration, this does nothing for puffiness or under-eye circles. I received this as a sample, and I'm glad I did, as I might have been tempted to part with way too much money for it (based on all the hype and on my dark circles). Creams are available which are just as nice and for a lot less money. ",4
"While this is not my ""fav"" I do find this scent to be very lovely. It is hard to describe the actual smell, but it is very sophisticated and elegant. A littlle on in the morning and it lasts and lasts and lasts without being overpowering.",1
"While this line produces great products, this foundation is just so-so in coverage and color. It's got a thin formula, and no matter how applied, whether a brush or sponge, the look it not a long lasting, all day one. ",3
"While this product definitely curled the lashes I applied it to, I found it difficult to use. When I curled the outer lashes with it, it wound up flattening the other lashes that I'd already curled. I was never able to work with it successfully. ",4
"While this product goes on nicely and looks good, it seems to remain gooey all day long and doesn't hold up. It does seem to have a conditioning effect on my lashes, but still, it's far too expensive to not do the basic job. I even tried it TWICE just in case I had a 'bad' tube. So that was what? Almost $60 for something that was not even close to value for the money spent. ",3
"While you are correct that the ingredients irritate skin slightly, I can assure you that it is safe (I'm a Pathologist). The way it works may sound scary, but in truth, the hand soap we all use multiple times a day is more irritating to our skin than this stuff! ",0
"Whoa...this is the GREATEST! Tried Perfeckt, High Beam, Magic Cream (Prescriptives) and this--hands down--does the job the best. I don't want ""shimmery"" 43-year-old skin but do want the highlights this type of product offers. Really lights up the inside of my upper eyelids--that dark place under where my eyebrow and the bridge of my nose starts to where I feel I don't really need eyeshadow. I'm really glad to see Sephora finally has this product!",2
"Whoever hasn't tried Urban Decay eyeshadow is really missing out. This stuff is the BEST, and I've tried lots. They have so many amazing colors and tons of sparkle. I have at least 20 shades and I still want more! The color is rich and long lasting and to the people complaining about the glitter falling on their faces, who cares??!! Just wipe it off'! That's all you have to do. First I sweep the majority of it off with toilet paper then I use my powder puff to get the rest. Glitter on my face will not stop me from these beautiful sparkly shades! My fave is Midnight Cowboy Rides Again, where else are you gonna get such gorgeous glitter? Only Urban Decay! And hey, I may be 40 but I'm still rocking these eye shadows! I even wear them to work and have got many compliments, especially on the shade ""Chopper"". ",2
"Why are we still offering this? Appears to be an overall disappointment. Not that it couldn't be improved, it is a good concent, especially for those of us with light lashes. But, it stiffens your lashes (not flexible at all) and it also flakes off onto your skin (and your pillow). Work on this, eh? We need a good lash stain. ",4
"Why did it take so long for someone to come up with such a practical brush like this? The angle allows you to apply any form of eyeliner exactly where you want it, especially between the lashes because your hand is not blocking your vision. This brush is particularily useful if you have a tendency to blink when your user hand crosses over to the opposing eye. In addition, the angle is pretty nifty to put to your advantage if you wear glasses. ",4
Why didn't someone come up with this idea sooner? I bought it as a gift to myself--and I am just loving trying out all the different fragrances. The sample bottles are bigger than I expected. And I love the idea of the certificate for the full-size bottle when you decide which one is best. Would make an ideal gift too. ,4
"Why oh why did I stray from my routine that was working for me? Darn the lure of samples!\nI actually used to use Philosophy's Hope in a Jar (before I discovered what products really worked for my skin). I had a few samples of this cleanser along with the rest of my Hope in a Jar, so I decided to try that regime for awhile.\nThe first day, my skin looked fantastic. Felt clean, rosy glow, etc. Within a few days, I had both dry patches and milia forming, and my skin's texture just did not look good.\nMy theory: The cleanser stripped my skin too much, and the Hope in a Jar clogs my pores more than it moisturizes. Just for reference, I have skin that does not get zits, but major problems with milia, blackheads and enlarged pores.",1
Why pay $100.00 for a product that is suppose to grow your lashes. When this stuff can do it for you. So you have to put on 2-3 coats. But the lengh and the thickness of your lashs will double. Any mascara glides over this product with no problem and lasts all day and all night. Save the money and use this product even by itself it is a great conditioner for your lashes ,3
"Wish I could say better things, but while it smiled great and felt good on my skin I didn't see much in the way of improvements. I was hoping for softer cuticles, heels and elbows but saw little change in texture or appearance. Nice idea and package but not effective for me. ",3
"With a head full of fine, wispy hair, the end of the day usually means oily hair for me. I've been looking for a dry shampoo to freshen up with before going out on the town after work, but this wasn't the answer for me. The small size and spray effect are great, but the powder comes out wet... not fun. They do mention this on the can and say that you should wait until it dries and then shake it out of your hair along with the oils, but I didn't see a change afterward... so sad! ",1
"With a little trepidation, I finally bought these in Stash and 1999 to give them a try. I'm fond of either no eye makeup or a dramatic smoky eye, so I don't reach for bright colors very much anymore. (I used to, when I first discovered UD, but now I don't have the budget to sample every pretty, glittery eye shadow I see.) But, I thought that these would be fun for everyday use instead of using no eyeliner.\n\nBoth are beautiful colors with my green-gold eyes. I'm also impressed with the staying power. All in all, I'm very happy. They even look good with no mascara (sometimes eyeliner can look weird without dramatic lashes) which is wonderful. I'm lazy.",0
With all the hype about the big O - I figured I'd give it a try. I've got medium toned skin with golden/olive undertones. This blush is fabulous and a little goes a long way. I like to use Amour under O when I want to kick it up a notch. I also use Nico when I'm sporting the no-makeup look. It gives my skin a luminous look without the sparkles.\nBelieve the hype.,2
"With great results! A must have prior to applying your moisturizer. Use daily and your skin will be exfoliated, clean and clear! And will have a smooth, soft look when you apply your foundation or powder. One of Clinique's best!!!",3
"With over 40 skin that is still acne-active, this cleanser has the amazing ability to deep clean pores without drying or irritating. I started using about a year ago, with amazing results on the fine lines that are beginning to show. At an amazing $30 price point, it lasts forever too! ",2
"wonderful consistency, great scent, and- is way too heavy for my fine, dry hair. it is staggeringly popular so I tried it, and while moisturizing, it made my hair quite limp. I used the tiniest bit next time and- same outcome. not for me. ",2
WONDERFUL FEEL AND FINISHED LOOK ON SKIN. I WORE THIS MAKE UP TO SEE MY SISTER BEFORE SHE DIED AND SHE TOLD ME I HAD FINALLY FOUND THE RIGHT LOOK IN MAKEUP. IT IS A TEXTURE THAT GOES ON THE SKIN SO PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND BLENDS SO WELL. ,4
"Wonderful! I love these, they feel so gentle and clean well. They don't leave any slimy residue like others. Josie Thank you! Long overdue! Thanks for the global commitment-gotta love the Polar Bears! ",2
"Wonderful........luv luv luv it..........the colors, the way all the eye shadows and blushes go on. Most of all luv luv luv the fact that it is organic. Will definitely be buying from Cargo again.....SOON!!! ",3
"Wonderfully Clean, Fresh Scent. Lasts about 6 hours before touchup needed. Definetly one of my Favorites. If you love Fresh Lemon you will want to include this scent. Try mixing them..........Ahhhhhhhhh !!! ",4
"Wonderfully sheer powder - Lasts all day - Matifies beautifully. However, there are no instructions as to application. Do you tap a little into the top and use a brush to pick it up and apply? Do you dip a brush into the container? Do you use a puff? ",4
"Wonderful product. I have used many different kinds of mascaras but ultimately return to Diorshow! It's gives a wonderful doe-eyed look - dramatic volume and length, yet light on your lids. I've been asked many a time if I was using false lashes and every time I owed it to Diorshow! ",2
"WONDERFUL product! When it comes to a thick, rich facial moisturizer for dry faces, or whatever, this one far outweighs many others I have tried ~ some at a much higher price. I LOVE this moisturizing face cream! ",4
"words can't describe how awesome this product works. all i can say is if your skin is tired and dry and needs a pick me up, try this. apply it at night and when you wake up the next morning your skin will look rested, nourished and hydrated. i have tried so many lines and moisturizers and treatments, this one takes the cake and is worth every penny. a little goes a long way. thanks sephora and dr. perricone ",2
"Worked when nothing else would, and results were immediate. I have very sensitive skin, but was experiencing a horrible breakout of acne on my back and chest, and nothing else that I tried would work. When I tried the Murad wash, my skin looked clearer the next day, and was totally clear within a week. The beauty part is, my skin was not irritated at all, in fact felt softer. Price may seem a little steep for a body wash, but it is worth every cent.",1
"Worked with this for three months, used too much to return, and wish I hadn't. It moisturized, but within two hours I was soaked with oil, had to wipe my face down when I was at lunch, between work and school, and when I got home at night. Made me really greasy, definitely not impressed with this product.",1
"Works as promised -- this stuff transforms your favorite eyeshadow into a long-wearing, quick-drying, waterproof liquid liner. While this isn't quite as economical as just getting a bottle of something like Make Up For Ever's Eye Seal and using it with your own eyeliner brush, having the brush and solution together in a compact package is great for travel and portable makeup kits! If you plan to switch between light and dark colors, however, be warned that the sponge-tip ""brush"" stains easily, and if you're not careful about cleaning it off the solution may eventually pick up color as well -- you may want to invest in a set of two and reserve one for lighter shadows, one for dark. I'd give it five stars if not for the applicator -- I prefer a real brush, for my tastes they give a better line than the foam brush-pen tips and are longer-lasting and easier to clean. ",2
"Works as well as much higher priced balms. I use it before bed after my regular skin care treatment and it really protects. I also use it on my kids (10, 3) for chapped cheeks and lips and to protect when they go out in the snow and cold. ",3
"Works good to help me with eye makeup boo-boos. It's gentle and non oily for me. Important to keep it clean for best use. It's unique, but not always a quick fix for other makeup disaters like foundation/concealer build ups. ",0
"Works great and smells even better! I used to use baby powder (which I found to be quite messy) and then switched to the Bumble and Bumble line (which left a white film in my hair) but the Oscar Blandi product is far better than anything I've tried. It refreshes both the volume and smell of my hair, removes oil, and does not leave a white powdery film. I use it every other day to extend my shampoo and find the full size can lasts 2 months or so. ",1
Works very well for dry hair. I used this everyday this summer and especially when I spent a week in Vegas...it was 106 degrees and my hair acted like it never felt a thing. Beautiful aromatic scent that is as pleasant as it is good for your hair. ,1
"Works very well with only a slight sting. My lips definitely look plumper. I would not say it hydrates my lips. In fact after wearing it, makes my lips feel slightly drier. I had been using the LipFusion XL at night and this during the day faithfully, until it caused my lips to dry out and peel. Now I just use the lip plump alone. ",2
"Would have rated this five stars, if the fair color was actually fair. It's more of a medium, so I would suggest buying the lightest color, for a medium. Can be layered to achieve full coverage. If they add a lighter color, I will defintely purchase again. ",3
"Wouldn't go out without it. VERY natural looking and good for the skin. IF necessary, one could actually get away with sleeping in it without clogging pores. I simply LOVE this product & wouldn't use any other product on my face. I use it in conjunction with ARBONNE, which I also would not do without. Great cleansing, younger looking product also.",4
"Wouldn't really recommend, they all seemed average and nothing spectacular about any of them really, except for the sephora brand one thats the only good one. I would suggest just getting a better quality full sized mascara! ",1
"Wow, 7 high quality full sized products for $55?! What a deal, I wish everyone would buy this and skip the huge Tarte palette. Even though I am olive-toned, the tinted moisturizer looks good on me. I agree with all the reviews below, this is awesome! Plus, all the products go so well together!!!! Don't be afraid of the gray liner, it doesn't look freakish. My only complaint is that two the eyeshadows popped out of the compact minutes after opening it, but I'll just exchange it. It didn't bug me too much because these are SUCH GREAT PRODUCTS!!!!!!!! ",0
"Wow, an overnight soak with this, hair comes out thick, shiny, healthy WOW I have long, thick, dry hair and this one really stepped up to the plate.....didn't think I'd find a great conditioner in an obscure hair brand..sic! ",2
"wow, everybody loves this conditioner! I MUST have weird hair... I was expecting it to be more strengthening, as this is what protein will do for fine, weak hair. it was a nice conditioner, made my hair softer as any decent conditioner would, but I didn't get the results the other posters seem to be enjoying. sigh. ",2
"Wow... I cannot get enough of this line. I really love the brand itself. I have been using it for years (mostly the hand creams), but recently discovered this particular line. I LOVE the scent and as always L'Occitane's cream is truly delightful. I will purchase again... and again.. ",1
"WOW! I don't normally like flowery fragrances - but, this I LOVE! It definitely has a fruity sense to it as well - which I think reallly compliments the florals they used for this scent. I just received the sample of it yesterday with my order and... I'll be ordering this today! FABULOUS! ",1
"WOW! If you're me and love shiny, sparkly and glittery of all things, this one is for you. I purchased this with a dark grey (Gunmetal) shadow and it is a perfect compliment. Because of my skin tone, I cannot wear this alone, but I do layer is with darker shadows for the extra zing! However if you are one of the lucky few that could wear this silver shadow with glitter flakes, I envy you. ",1
"Wow I love these little sets! They really take the guesswork out of coordinating shadows. I own two (All about Eve, which is PERFECT and I wear it everyday, and Underworld) and I absolutely love them. The color looks great with one layer (a bit sheer) or a few (rich). One thing I have to say is: I don't recommend buying these from the site. The color descriptions they give are inaccurate and you might be disappointed when you get them in the mail. Underworld is NOT as light as it looks... It's pretty smoky but I still ended up liking it! ",0
"Wow, I must be the only one that didn't like it. True, it is light...but when you put it on your face, it feels wet and doesn't reabsorb all the way. Also, I feel like I am taking OFF my bronzer/powder if I am putting it on my face. Not impressed with the product. ",1
"Wow, I saw this set in the store and was shocked at the very low price of this jam packed set! Beautiful shadows, blushes and glosses. I kept turning it and each time I turned it I was like, ""Woah!"" as there would be another pull out with more makeup! This would make a great gift for the makeup lover (young or old alike) in your life... including yourself! Super cute music box! ",1
"Wow! Is this a fun little lash curler. I was hesitant when the make-up artist at Sephora suggested this as an alternative to the usual manual eyelash curler but, after using it twice, I got the hang of it and love it! No more pinching my lid or pulling my eyelashes out. Just what I was looking for - no need for falsh lashes! ",3
"Wow! Is what I can say about this mascara! I have tried just about every mascara in the market and I must say this is the very best by far! It's takes care of volumizing, lenthening and defines your lashes beautifully! Highly recommend it! ",2
"Wow! so yet again Philosophy does not dissapoint. I have tbe bronzer and just a skin colored one and i wear them together and it doesn't looked caked on at all. You can barely tell you're wearing makeup, i've gotten a lot of compliments on my complexion when it's on, and any blemishes get washed away with it! ",0
"Wow! This is not the best choice of product. After experimenting with two brands, I picked the GO/Brow. The brown side turned white on me quickly. The highlighter stays on but after sharpening this pencil once it is almost gone. ",3
"wow -- this is the worst mascara idea in years!! The brush makes it impossible to apply, what little mascara does get on, is extremely clumpy and it is very difficult to get an even application. Yuck! ",2
Wow--what a great way to try something out like this so you can decide if it is something you might really want. I absolutely love the face primer and the eye lightener---it was worth the price for those 2 alone. It was a fabulous kit!! I love it. ,3
"WOW! What a terrific product. I was reluctant to try it due to it looking so dark. The box has great pictures and instructions, and the brush is nice there is no way you can mess up. I have applied it both ways they show it and also use the brush for other bare min shadow. ",2
"Wow! When I opened my package I was pleasantly surprise! It looks nothing like the picture, the handle is longer and it comes with white hair. It is so soft and feels so nice and is big and fluffy. I think it will be my most favorite brush. Just love it! ",2
"Wrote the same review for the shampoo. Makes my hair shiny, not greasy. After using it for awhile, started making my hair feel sticky and scalp a little itchy. Don't know if it is from the shampoo though as they are used together. Too bad cause otherwise, makes my hair look great without being too soft. ",1
Yall are geniuses for giving this out as a sample. I am sure everyone who tries it will buy it! My eyebrows happened to be a little overplucked when I got my sample... and they looked perfect after I used this! I am pretty sure I will use this every day from now on. You know those model's eyebrows in the magazines.. I'm pretty sure they use this.,0
"yeah, a daily must. i mix mine with a double helping of the acai/blueberry supplement in 12 oz h2o and head to the gym. can't believe i've lived this long without this!! well worth the big bucks--aren't you?? ",2
"Yeah, not loving this one, Fekkai -- though your products usually rock. This made my bra-length hair frizzier than ever, and made it sticky and tangly, too. This was promtly returned. I'm just not into giving myself a bad hair day! ",1
"Yeah, when will they ever get this back in stock again??? I love this scent, it is so pretty and tropical without being too overbearing and no icky floral scent. My little boys love to sniff my clothes and even my boyfriend likes it. Sometime I will layer it with something else but most times I like wearing just this. ",2
"Years ago an old boyfriend picked out this perfume for me. I fell in love instantly, not just because of who chose it, but because the scent is heavenly and perfect for day or evening wear. Plus, every time I wear it I get endless compliments. Highly recommended.",1
"Yes, even in my age range, I still get pimples every so often (lovely!). Anyway - I ordered this on a whim thinking that I could always return it...but....it's great! I don't how, but it reduces redness and you can't imagine how fast blemishes go away. Noticeable difference overnight. Great product -- doesn't dry your skin! ",2
"yes! finally, a totally portable makeup studio with every color to please even the most fickle make up divas. again, wow! not only does this palette boast the largest color range of product I've yet seen apart from an actual makeup counter, ALL of the products are high-quality, Sephora brand color. I literally gasped when I opened my Blockbuster. Sephora, thank you for this product. you spoil us, and we love you for it! -great for travel -great for weddings -keep one at work for that spur-of-the-moment night out -just plain fun! ",2
"Yes, I am one of the MANY that LOVES this eyeshadow primer. It makes your eyeshadow look more vibrant and it will stay pretty all day. Only complaint is the bottle which doesn't allow you to get at all of the product. ",2
"Yes - I have enough lipsticks to stock an entire beauty store, but this one really stands out. I bought a second shade after I got the first one because I liked the texture so much and it really does last well. ",3
Yes...it does give the look of twilight. But it has methylparaben and propylparaben (WAX) added. It was just too thick and greasy for me. Fresh face luster and bronzer is pretty and gives a feathery glow..I know you will like them!!! ,2
"Yes, it really is that good. Before I tried this I never got very excited about blush, but this color really lights up my face. I have the fairest of fair skin with a slight pink undertone, and this blush is a perfect compliment. I also like the slight shimmer. The texture is lovely. I like the size of the package but the slight rubbery outside picks up powder and gets dirty easily.",1
"Yesterday I recieved Rose Birman and I sooo love the color, it will be awesome for fall and winter. It is a muted berry wine that looks about the shade range of a darker natural color of the lips. Looks like it would be great on any skin tone. ",3
"Yes, the colors are gorgeous...but:\nthe color can appear un-natural and brassy-looking (like my Orga$m color did). It's a tad bit expensive, because it runs out fast. I prefer tarte's blush Tipsy more.",0
"You cannot go wrong with Nars. I have Outlaw and Albatross and both work beautifully. I can use it as a highlighter, eyeshadow, layer with a bronzer--it's so versatile. It has never cracked on me, and the case is functional with the mirror. Always happy with their line.",1
"You don't have to be into the tattoo scene to thoroughly love Ms. Von D's line. The flexibility of these products is what makes them amazing. These are high-quality cosmetics, that I consider up there with Smashbox. ",1
"you don't have to keep curling, once or twice gives your lashes a good curl. BUT, I have never had one that has lasted over 3 months. The fact that it is made of plastic causes it to break where you push the lever to curl your lashes. I love the size etc, but it needs to be made with sturdier materials. ",4
"You don't need too much product to get the job done. Just comb through towel dried hair. I complete my shower routine and by that time i am ready to rinse out the phytokarite, and a beauty ritual is complete. This treatment even smells nourishing. I find that i can go an extra day without washing my hair because this product leaves my hair so full and hydrated. I don't feel like i have to wash it again to 'pump it up.' I use this product with the phytonector shampoo, which is very intensive and smells beautiful. ",3
"you get spf 15, color, and gloss. its a great product if your always on the go and or if your an outdoors kinda person. i also gave this to my lil sister who didnt like wearing sunblock on her lips. she didnt even notice she was lookin pretty and protected! ",0
"You just won't believe how wonderful this peel is. And, in pad form, it takes just second everyday to make your skin it's best. Also helps heal blemishes. And, once you've finished with it on your face, swab it over the backs of your hands. Helps remove dead skin there, too. And will help lighten brown spots and scars!! ",2
"You know those cheap dollar-glittery lipglosses? This is basically the same thing! The subtle color eventually wears off and leaves behind the green chunks of glitter... Disgusting! I don't know if all the colors have glitter in them, but I'd avoid the ones that do! It feels horrible on your lips because the chunks of glitter feels like rocks! Don't waste your money! ",0
"You only need a little pea sized amount each day. Use too much and it will make your hair greasy. But, in small amounts, it is a miracle. Smooths all the flyaways and makes my hair shine like crazy. Love it. ",1
Your face will never feel cleaner. Plus the variety of brush heads are nice. But beware if you use acne products or products with retinol/retin-A. Like moisturizers these products will also penetrate deeper when applied after cleansing. I learned that the hard way by gettin some major irritation. My advice go easy on the those products until you become more accustomed to using the brush. ,1
"Your make up really won't go anywhere! I used it with cream eyeliner and it was stuck in time all night long. Be careful, though, because if you're looking to smudge it for an effect you have to work fast. ",0
"Your're ready to go out, makeup in place, looing great, but you need something more. Swirl this over the apples of your cheeks, and it's like your face is smiling in the sun or hit by starlight! Five stars for younger women, four stars for older women who must wear lots of moisturizer which can make the blush a bit too shiny.",4
"You will adore this if you love berry scented balms. It is smooth, feels good, has good slip and has staying power. It makes your lips feel softer, and keeps them shiny and kissable. My boyfriend does not like berries, and shys away from the scent on my lips. ",3
"You will be a ""show stopper"" in this fashion god's perfume. I don't know why it isn't under the Luxury section b/c it's for the ultra diva in all of us. Wait! Let's put it where my man Tom belongs and that is the ""Uber"" catagory. Uuumhum! ",2
You will not need a lot of this hand cream. It really does the job well. I keep it by my bedside and use it each night. Really works. Love the fragrance. I like to buy the gift packs of these hand creams as holiday presents. All the women love them! ,4
"You will see everything, including things you might not want to know about, without distortion and very clearly in this wonderful mirror. I check skin status and makeup status, and I no longer worry about leaving home in imperfect makeup. Any Irving Rice mirror is worth every penny. ",4
Yummy smelling body wash! guys that love coffee will wonder what your wearing but love to smell you and be near you (smile) its pretty cool! Well enjoy! bottles need to be a little bit bigger though is only downside to it! ,2
"Zero stars for stimulating brow growth. An entire tube now used with no added brow growth at all, not even little stubs. It's rather expensive as a conditioner only, so I won't be getting this one again. Big disappointment as I really wanted this to work. ",4
